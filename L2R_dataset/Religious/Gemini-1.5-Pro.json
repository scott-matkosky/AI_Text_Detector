Let the hurting parts complain if they must.\n\nJudge praise by its source \u2013 what do those offering it value? What do they avoid?

All the Lamanite prisoners joined the people of Ammon, working tirelessly to till the land and raise abundant grain and livestock.  This freed the Nephites from the responsibility of all the Lamanite prisoners. \n", "After completing the work, they brought the remaining money to King Jehoiada.  With it, they made vessels for the LORD's temple:  bowls, offering plates, spoons, and other vessels of gold and silver.

Place all these in the hands of Aaron and his sons, and they shall wave them as a wave offering before the LORD. \n", "King Josiah organized the priests, encouraging them in their service to the LORD's temple. He addressed the Levites, who were teachers for Israel and consecrated to the LORD: \"Place the holy ark in the temple that Solomon, son of David, built.

Prepare yourselves according to your ancestral houses and your assigned rotations, as David, king of Israel, and his son Solomon ordained.\" \n", "Contemplate the countless ways death comes for us all - people of every origin, profession, and walk of life. From the everyday to the famous \u2013  Philistio, Phoebus, Origanion \u2013 all meet the same end. Journey through the ages, to generations past.  See the orators and philosophers:  Heraclitus, Pythagoras, Socrates. Witness the heroes of old and the great leaders of recent times; the kings and conquerors.  Remember Eudoxus, Hipparchus, Archimedes, and countless others - brilliant, ambitious, tenacious souls. Even the greatest cynics, those like Menippus who mocked the fleeting nature of life, are gone.\n\nRemember that all these are long dead, and they suffer not for it.  Those without even the legacy of a name, are they any worse off? There is but one thing truly worthwhile in this life, one thing deserving of our focus: to live with truth and righteousness, and to treat even the deceitful and unjust with patience and love. \n", "It's fascinating to note a shift in how the Quran portrays Paradise and its rewards.  Early Suras, written when Muhammad had only one wife, an older woman of sixty, prominently feature promises of beautiful Houris for the faithful. However, in the ten years following the Hejira, mentions of women as rewards become scarce, appearing only twice.  Interestingly, later Suras, such as  XXXVI. 56, XLIII. 70, XIII. 23, and XL. 8,  depict a different image:  the faithful entering Paradise alongside their own devoted wives. This evolution in the depiction of Paradise offers a compelling glimpse into the development of Quranic thought and its reflection of the Prophet's own life experiences. \n", "\"Therefore, go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

The virtuous soul may find their absence met with a sense of relief, their strict adherence to principle now a faded echo. For others, burdened by our flaws and the weight of our shared history, death brings a whispered hope for a lighter tomorrow.\n\nThis realization, though unsettling, can serve as a poignant meditation. As we approach our own mortality, let us not cling to this world with desperate grasp. Instead, let us strive to live in such a way that our absence leaves a void felt genuinely by those we hold dear. \n\nYet, even in recognizing this bittersweet reality, let us not harden our hearts.  Continue to cherish your loved ones, offer them kindness and support.  But let this love be a source of strength, not a shackle binding you to this earthly existence.

Seven years melted away, then another, until a desolate century had passed. The disciples chosen by Jesus, their light and leadership extinguished, had all departed to the paradise of God\u2014all but three, left behind like solitary embers in the gathering darkness. Though others were chosen to fill their vacant mantles, a chill settled over the faithful as an entire generation succumbed to the icy grip of death. \n\n\n", "Honored assembly, let us acknowledge the resplendent truth proclaimed by the Tathagata!

Like a radiant lamp piercing the darkness, he bestows clarity upon those with eyes to see. \n\n\n", "My dear son, despite the formidable and persistent resistance we encounter, it is imperative that we maintain unwavering diligence in our efforts.  To cease our labors would be to invite condemnation upon ourselves, for the duration of our sojourn in these mortal vessels necessitates continuous exertion.

Shall it be gentle meekness, unwavering fortitude, steadfast truth, unwavering faith, unblemished sincerity, serene contentment, or perhaps another entirely?\n\nApproach each element of this experience with discernment, whispering to yourself, \"This comes directly from the hand of God, a divine orchestration.\" Or perhaps, \"This arises from the intricate web of interconnectedness, a consequence of the natural order, or even mere chance.\" \n\nAnd what of the role played by those around you?

However, Salman's embrace of Islam occurred much later, far from the bustling marketplace of Mecca. \n\nOthers, like the esteemed scholar N\u00f6ld, propose that the passage might allude to Suheib, son of Sinan, a man who bore the unique distinction of being called \u201cthe first fruits of Greece\u201d by the Prophet himself.  Suheib\u2019s story unfolds like a captivating epic;  torn from his Mesopotamian home as a child, he was sold as a slave, his journey taking him through the hands of Greek traders and the nomadic Beni Kalb before finally arriving in Mecca, where he was purchased by Abdallah ibn Jodda\u2019\u00e2n.  Through wit and determination, Suheib amassed considerable wealth, and upon hearing the message of Islam, he readily embraced the faith.\n\nYet another compelling theory, championed by Dr. Sprenger, suggests that the passage might point to the enigmatic Addas, a monk who had abandoned the tranquil monastery of Nineveh to seek his destiny in the heart of Mecca.  Each of these figures, their lives intertwined with the nascent days of Islam, presents a tantalizing possibility, adding layers of richness and intrigue to the historical narrative. \n\n\n", "Tell my servant David this: \"The LORD of Hosts has spoken.
