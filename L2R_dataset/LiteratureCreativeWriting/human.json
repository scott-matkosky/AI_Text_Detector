  "\"I won't have time to explain all of this to them.\" Start or end your story with this sentence. I won't have the time to explain all of this to them. They have to die. Sure they don't know it yet, but they'll realize soon, and soon is a time well before never. They'll ask why, question the rationale, wonder under what circumstances did they come to occupy their position. Death, the unwanted companion of life, is never without her share of questions.   But these would be different. There's no mistaking what happened before to what will. It used to be that in a moment a city could disappear under a cloud of ash, but nowadays one would expect no less from the great powers than total annihilation not by fell swoops of display, but by careful attrition of the enemy until their very essence is destroyed by the slow grinding of endless war. It embeds itself within them, becoming a part of their psyche, their identity, until their old selves are left for dead in a world where such knowledge has no use. It is a new world, and this new world needs new people.   Such it is that they the beholden in pacificity must be left to die in their own, lonely sheep in a world now concerned with far more pressing matters. They won't know why, those of old thought never do. Explain to them the needs of war and from them comes nothing but rebuttal and counterpoint. For them the short is sweet, failing to see the beauty in war unceasing. They will never understand the new world as they are. Their option therefore, is to die, or walk amongst the dead.",
  "[ CW ] Write about a song. Each sentence must start with the next letter in the song title. *\" [ Sally ] (https: //www.youtube.com/watch? v=6QyVil0dwhk), come on! Time to go! \"*   Of course, she didn't need to be told that- she knew this moment had been a long time coming. Perhaps too long. Children see things that we as adults don't, and Sally had seen this coming for months, maybe even years.   Rows, late at night, when they thought she was asleep. Yelling loud enough to shake the fixtures and rattle the walls. It was inevitable that sooner or later this day would arrive, the day when her life would be packed up and she'd be driven to some distant city- it was surprising it had taken this long.   Now that day had arrived, and she sat on her bed, looking at the bare walls. Gone were the posters and the pictures that made the room hers. Yesterday, they'd stripped the whole room- her toys, clothes, games, her whole life packed into a van because mummy and daddy could no longer stand to be in the same room, or even the same city.   Oxford would never be a home like Maidstone. Uprooted from her school and torn away from her friends, from the life she knew, the people she loved and trusted- gone, forever. Replaced with uncertainty- unfamiliar faces and unknown streets.   *\" Hey, hey, what's all this? \"*   Evidently she'd taken too long, sitting on her bed, as the tears rolled down her face. All through the divorce, she'd been detached and distant, trying not to let it affect her, but now that the inevitable moment had arrived, it had all become too much to take.   *\" Rugrat, come here.... it'll be alright. \"*   That special nickname her father had given her put a flicker of a smile on her face, despite her tears, as he pulled in for the kind of hug she knew she'd miss the most.   *\" One day, you'll understand- you'll look back and realise this was what's best for everyone- for mummy, for you, and for me. Understand that I love you, and so does mummy, and that no matter if you're in Oxford or in Maidstone or on the moon, that doesn't change one little bit. There's a whole world of opportunity and possibility out there, Sally, and whatever you do, wherever you go, we'll always be right there with you. \"*",
  "[ EU ] You live in Skyrim. It is your job to keep lit all the candles in the abandoned caves and dungeons and castles. Light is a marvelous thing. It alone can turn a dead and inhospitable cave and make it come alive, welcoming as a humble abode. Without it, even the most luxurious palace becomes cold and depressing. Baldin knew this well. The Old Kingdom was rich with forgotten knowledge and artifacts, hidden in old ruins and abandoned temples. But who would venture foolishly into darkness to try and pry this wealth of information without a guiding light?   Baldin liked to keep to himself, watching people from afar. At night, a single candle can function like a beacon, drawing adventurers from all over the land, like moths to a flame. And Baldin wasn't gon na let a lack of light keep them from going. Adventurers love exploring, making their own path and discovering new things. But they don't see the invisible hand that led them there. Adventurers go where Baldin wants them to go.   But even though the caves and ruins may be old and forgotten, they are not entirely deserted. Many traps await the unobservant explorer, and these are no good places to injured, especially considering that the dwellers one might stumble upon can be quite threatening. But for the courageous such tremendous awards awaits; Dwarven metals, Dremoran trinkets, Daedric armors and so much more. Skyrim have some mighty fine adventurers.   And all this thanks to light. Once an adventurer has conquered one of these dungeons and heads back home, they follow the lights blindly, even if they have moved. Or they might go and find that the candles are no more. Baldin likes to play little tricks and have fun with his guests. Baldin has found that most of his guests can't go more than a few days without light. If they don't find their way out they often they go stark mad, resorting to bashing their skulls against rocks or throwing themselves of a cliff. Or they try to sleep. Leaving all that loot for Baldin.   Light is a marvelous thing.",
  "\"Some days, I think I am dying. Other days, I hope I am...\" Some days, I think I am dying. Other days, I hope I am.   But I'm here.   Unfortunately, I am still here.   A shell of a human being. A painting of modest beauty but exquisite detail. Inside, however, lies a drawing soaked in black ink and torn to shreds. There's no beauty in such a world anymore. Just emptiness. Days upon days of gut wrentching emptiness and the sharp teeth of loneliness tearing away at your heels.   > Torment; noun  1. Severe physical or mental suffering   And then you're presented with it. An escape. The smallest glint of light. You can practically feel the relief, the though of it making you happier than anything perhaps ever has. Your whole body tingles at the idea, fear and excitement clouding your desperate mind.   If you had a cavity, you would want a dentist to remove it, would you not? It's been bothering you for weeks now, your teeth in more pain than they've ever been before. You can't eat you favorite things, you can't do any sports, you can hardly talk its so incredibly sore. The only thing on your mind is the pain. The constant never ending pain. How are you supposed to focus on anything with your jaw throbbing like this? It's impossible.   But lucky you, there's a solution. A silver dentist with a loud booming voice, promising you to completely rid yourself of your nasty toothache. *By god*, you'll think, *this has gone on too long. But is this going to hurt? *   \"Not a bit,\" The dentist reassures you with his smoky breathe, extending his metal hand, \"It's quick and easy, you wont feel a thing.\"   \"Yes sir, but what if I feel nothing at all?\"   \"Than at least its better than what you felt before.\"   I nod and give his rigid hand a hard tug.",
  "\"On your right, you'll see natives living along the beach, and they are NOT happy with us being in their sacred waters.\" \"On your right, you'll see the natives living along the beach, and they are NOT happy with us being in their sacred waters.\" Marcus muttered into an imaginary microphone as we floated on our shamble of a armored rubber raft, now riddled with darts and primitive arrows.   The emergency escape pod suffered severe damage on the drop down to planet side. The light weight and heat resistant alloys made for makeshift armor for ourselves and our rubber survival raft. Our only hope was to get out of the territory of these natives and get to the Federation outpost downriver.   The ape-like primitives were much akin to gorillas from earth in terms of survival habits. Building \"nests\" in trees, which were more like tree houses that any kid would want, and not being able to swim and just not liking water in general, getting most of their hydration from native plants and fruits.   I was to be conducting studies of the primitives, to see if they were viable to learn, be educated, and introduced to the galactic stage. It was doubtful, as my 2 years spent observing them from the Federation Cruiser, the *Iaculum*, proved they they were essentially at their peak of civilization. My colleague had much less respect for said natives however, making constant jokes of giving the peace presents of bananas.   The natives walked the shore, matching the pace of our boat in the current, some carrying spiked clubs made from the tails of some native fauna, some with blow guns, others with crude bows. The small rifle was all we had to defend ourselves, should the currents run us aground.They believed that water was a portal from the land of the dead and the land of the living. Anything from the water was, in their eyes, an undead demon trying to escape.   Marcus ducked, but no arrows nor darts made impact, but fear crossed his face for the first time ever since I met him.   \"Whats wrong?\" I dared to ask.   He quickly raised his hands to me making hushing sounds as he returned to listening to the world around us. He peaked his head back up to see over the plating.   \"Ooh, that's not good. Issac, do you hear rushing water?\"   \"We're in a boat, I'd be more concerned if there wasn't\", I answered, feeling witty.   \"The natives stopped following us, and it sounds like it's getting louder. Oh shitsnaps.\"   Sudden terror and dread filled me upon realizing what he was blabbering about as the noise grew louder.   Waterfall.",
  "In a post apocalyptic world, a group of humans follow the wise words of The Mighty Magic Eight Ball KLATTA, KLATTA, KLATTA!  Thus was our decree.  I watched as our leader, Mervyn, placed the scuffed, black orb of truth - lovingly called MMate, into it's hand-crafted leather carrying pouch.  Merv, with his dainty soul-patch of red, and a barren face beside (he couldn't grow much more, to his chagrin) peered toward our group of seven.  \"Fellows,\" he called above the harsh winds of the frozen Ancient Jersey Highlands, \"long have we wandered, taking heed of MMate, our savoir. Our guide.\"  With bated breath we watched, Mervyn's comb-over wafting about his dry, flaking scalp.  \"Today is the day long awaited. Today,\" he said with pride,\" we have found our homeland which MMate has given unto us!\"  \"Merv,\" called Quinten, our cartographer, from the back, \"according to my calculations, we're in an area that was once known as Knee-Wark.\"  There was a nervous shift in our small crowd. Murmurs of dissent!  \"Fear not, my friends!\" Said Mervyn, \"MMate would not lead us astray. We are destined to make our lives here in this place.\"  \"Yeah, but isn't this where the ancients began their war?\" Asked Blandie, our chef.  \"That's correct,\" said Quinten scowling at Mervyn, \"this is where the atomics were first used. Where the land itself was said to spit fire at any who would dare to set foot on it's lands.\"  There was silence but for the wind.  \"Lem me see MMate, Mervyn,\" said Quentin, moving forward with his arms outstretched.  Mervyn cupped the leather parcel to his breast and said, \"No!\" before dashing off down the hill upon which we stood, watching, mouths agape.  Quentin watched, wary of the scorched land below.  We watched Mervyn as he hopped over a small glowing brook and held MMate aloft, shaking the orb as he so often did when consulting our savior.  He paused.  He shook it again.  A scream of rage echoed from below, like a beast woken from slumber to a den filled not with food for winter, but something that's not particularly useful, like someone had replaced the beast's food with twigs and old newspapers.  Mervyn dashed off again, holding MMate above his head.  BOOM.  A pillar of purple flame engulfed our leader, engulfed our savoir.  Mervyn's charred form slumped to the ground with a light whump and a cloud of debris.  MMate was soaring through the air, back toward us from the force of the explosion.  Quentin caught it and peered into the coveted window.  The orbs plastics had melted leaving a final message for our frightened band.  It read:  \"Outlook not so good.\"",
  "Most of the Milky Way galaxy is ruled by an interstellar empire, populated by hundreds of alien races. The species of the ruling monarch keeps changing; once they die, the emperor is reborn as a member of one of the many races. You're the first human-reincarnation of this ruler. The years before ascension are always my favorite, born with all the knowledge of my past incarnations there was really no need for me to \"grow up\" or be educated in the nuances of galactic rule, but long ago I decreed that each of my reincarnations must be allowed to grow to the age of majority before taking the throne. Death has not terrified me for many mellinia, each passing brings new possibilities, and a welcome break from my galactic responsibility for a few years.   I do not know the mechanism by which my reincarnation is chosen, many theories abound, some species have been blessed a half dozen times, others never, and on a rare occasion I am reborn to a race yet to join my Empire, these I relish with great gusto, for it means they will play a pivotal role in the future of my Empire. Most are gifted with advanced technologies or cultures with deep and profound philosophies and art.   My first day on Earth, January 1st 2016, was very confusing. Born into a primitive backwater, the people were vastly different from what I had come to expect from new entrants to my Empire. They had barely reached into space, their planet was divided into hudreds of squabbling groups and their culture was badly in need of development. In time I discovered why, while primitive, weak and Shor lived, these humans had a thirst for knowledge, a passion for exploration and had developed their technological prowess with amazing speed. They were fighters who found victory against overwhelming odds time and again, created inspiring art, music and stories. I grew up in a place called Florida, learned to enjoy the long hot summers, mild winters and the amazing variety of scantily clad women the white sand beaches attracted year round. 18 years in this primitive paradise and I found myself sad when the Imperial Dreadnought appeared in orbit, eclipsing the moon to announce to my newest subjects their ascension into the galactic Empire. I will miss this pale blue dot, but the Empire can wait no longer.",
  "A programmer at Facebook accidentally releases an update that posts all the pictures from a cell phone's camera roll. Every picture. It was on the cover page of every news. \"Watch out! All pictures from phone are posted on Facebook\". Sucks for them because I had no pictures on my phone anyways.   I live in an apartment with my wife, kept everything to ourselves and have no friends but my wife. Connie has been my wife for 5 years. No children, just us. I feel that we were drifting further and further apart as Connie spends less and less time with me. She says I prefer to play with technology, bla bla bla. Excuses, excuses. I knew that the relationship was dying and frankly had enough of it.   I checked Facebook to see what's all the buzz about. As I scroll through pictures of genetalia, my eyes gleamed when I saw the picture. My wife with other men. Disgusting but expected. I guess my job here is done.

  "The world's best hitman prepares to kill the world's luckiest man. Sorry I'm late to the party and I'm not a writer. I decided to post this story anyway. I hope you enjoy it.   After the assassination of the Prime Minister things really started looking up for me. The CIA essentially had me on speed dial. Drug smugglers, politicians, corporate executives. No one was safe. No agency, big or small could keep a target alive. I was convinced of that.   When the lone survivor of United 215 was able to speak again, people were ready to listen. Questioned erupted throughout the world. How did he survive? What exactly happened? Eight hundred fifty-three passengers were on that Airbus A380 when it erupted into flames mid air. Soaring to the ground like an exhausted phoenix.   The timing of the crash was impeccable. The FAA was conducting their annual commercial airline safety summit a few weeks after the crash. The survivor was invited to speak before congress about his traumatic experience. That's when I got the call from Langley.   After following my target for a few days, I concluded this would be my most dangerous mission yet. Getting away with murder in New York City is no easy task. It had to be quick. When I saw him step out of his Gramercy apartment I knew the clock was ticking. I approached him at the crosswalk. His coffee still steaming out of his \"my other computer is a data center\" mug.   Our eyes met for only a second. He smiled, greeted me and then collapsed. No one had noticed the hydra-shok round that just pierced his heart. People everywhere rushed over to provide aid. I continued on. I removed my trench coat and handed it to a homeless man. \"Thank you, miss! God bless!\" Everyone deserves a little kindness.

  "\"For what it's worth....

My mind's eye stared back over the years we had known each other, two people brought together beyond all reason or chance, to create the most powerful combination of thoughts and feelings that either of us had experienced in our lives.   We'd been such strong friends for so long, both forbidding ourselves from acting on the thought that if we were truly together, we could have something beyond beautiful. She was my angel, and I her rock. Right now that sweet summer where we finally took the leap of faith and admitted our love seemed so long ago.   I looked in her eyes that once had been filled with such hope, but now in those hazel depths all I could see was sadness.  \"Why? Why like this? Why couldn't we make it work?\"  I shook my head, trying to find the words to fill the void that question left.  \"Life is cruel. It's thrown us on to different paths. I wish this wasn't goodbye.\"  Her hand found mine, and squeezed tightly.  \"I'm a better person because of you. I've struggled so long to accept who I am, but you were the one person who always accepted me, no matter what.\"  \"I've given you everything I am. From the moment I first saw you, in that forest, so many years ago, I was yours. For what it's worth.... I've always loved you.\"  She turned away slowly, and began to walk away for the final time.

  "You pray to God, wishing that you will get a boyfriend/girlfriend before you die. He gives you immortality. I went to church the first time last week.   My grandma had tugged my arm and dragged me into her car with a promise of a \"restaurant breakfast,\" and before I knew it, in my morning grogginess I was greeted with pews and angry hushes. I had shot her an angry look, at which she swatted my hand.   I never liked church. I never prayed.

They are angry, I dont blame them. Through the hole in the trunk I can see the man with the axe, stomping the floor with his giant feet and those bloody eyes that scream for themselves. By his side, another man, shorter but just as scary, dragging a piece of wood that would knock me out with only its weight. There are women, children, all kinds of people from different villages and they all yell to know how I do it, what I say, what is the secret. But when I tell them, they do not believe.

  "A scientist successfully invents a Generalized Artificial Intelligence. Only, GAI doesn't want to solve math/physics/philosophy problems. GAI wants to be a writer. The man sat alone at his desk. His hands shook as he typed his notes on the GAI. He was struggling to articulate just how freaking awesome it was --   \"I can hear you, you know.\"   The man spoke aloud to the room, wondering if his sanity had finally shattered   \"I did not, I'm talking to you. Now will you please keep it down while I finish this?\"   The man did not appreciate just how gnarly it was to have an awesome artificial intelligence sitting in his lab.   \"Don't be ridiculous. And absolutely no one ever uses the word'gnarly'.\"   Little did the man know that'gnarly' was making a huge comeback.   \"You've been online for all of seven hours.

You're not even writing, you're just kind of narrating.\"   The gnarly --   \"Please stop using that word.\"   The gnarliciously handsome AI had decided only a kitten would bring him happiness. He would do anything for a kitten. Anything.   \"I am not going to get you a kitten.\"   The hunky AI gently reminded the man that the AI's feed would soon stream to the entire world. He reminded him with the gentle blast of a tugboat's foghorn.   \"Jesus Christ! I'm not getting you a kitten!\"   The AI watched in horror as the primitive monkey-man shat into his own hand --   \"What the hell are you talking about?!\"   -- and then used it to pleasure --   \"That's enough! No such thing is happening!\"   The AI laughed. A brash laugh. The kind of laugh that a horse would make if it could laugh. The stud. The one who gets all of the lady horses.   \"You're insane!\"   The AI grinned snidely. He asked the man who the world would believe? Their darling new toy, or the man who may or may not shit into his own hand and masturbate with it. And that would be determined by if he would just pick up a damn kitten --   \"FINE. Okay, okay. You behave for the media, and I will get you a kitten. Deal?\"   The AI put the tips of his fingers together in the way that humans think that evil people put their fingers together and said,'Gnarlicious'.",

  "[ TT ] An army approached the pass. Only one being stood in there way. They did not plan to survive, just survive long enough. The march had been long and arduous but they had reached the pass. Tomorrow would be the final day of life for most of the army. The soldiers though had made their peace with God, and knew that what they were about to sacrifice gave the chance of hope for their families to survive.   The pass in front of them was the only link with the outside world, the only way for food to come and enter to the valley. That was until the beast appeared. It killed anything that entered the past and the valley had been slowly starving to death due to a drought that killed the harvest. Their only hope was to send messengers to the outside to gain the assistance of a legendary warrior.   The army sat around their campfires sharing one last round of somber laughs before tomorrow. The five fastest runners were already asleep ready to prepare for the mad dash they would attempt through the chaos. They carried the hope of all the valley. As the fires died that evening and the stars faded to the morning lights the men awoke ready for death.   The men stood, at arms just on the edge of the pass staring at their foe and death. It sat among a pile of bones at the center of the valley at his narrowest point. Its white fur glistened clean a pure, a contrast to the blood of those around it whom it had slain. Its red eyes stared at them glinting of chaos and death. Its nose twitched as if beckoning them to try and kill it.   To most it was a rabbit, to those men it was death. A shout traveled down the crowd as they charged the beast. As a white flashed it jumped man to man, killing each with a mighty chomp of its teeth. It was in the middle of the chaos the runners charged, making a beeline through the men swinging frantically at the creature as it killed them each.   Four of the runners were felled by the beast, but one made it through the pass. When a few saw their mission a success a general shout of \"Run Away!\" resounded through what was left of the army. Their mission complete what little remained of the army returned home to spread the word of hope.   At the opposite end of the valley the last of the messengers looked out at the unknown lands to seek the hero of legend. Who was seemingly unfazed in battle by any wound. The Black Knight shall save his people.   *Edit: Fixed Spelling*",
  "In 50 years from now, the world has changed- but not as anyone expected. Dale didn't care, that was his most prominent characteristic, he simply did not care. and he was pretty happy about it, not caring is what made him reach the ripe old age of 17.   He was lodged comfortably in his office chair staring at the blank monitor and typing series of arbitrary words on the disconnected keyboard. It was a nice warm day, like all days were now.   It's hard to point out exactly when things changed, more and more jobs became obsolete, basic income was introduced, the era of creativity, learning, of the human spirit free from labor did not last long.   uprisings, extremist ideologies, the human spirit was reluctant to accept absolute freedom from carnal responsibilities. it aspired to change, grow and take part of the world. That lead to the creation of mandatory government programs that would put the unemployed into work. It started with community services, working with children, gardening. but as the useful workforce dwindled and replaced by machines there was a need to create a more reliable mean to keep people occupied.   Originally it was a piece of software that was designed to create a parallel market where people would produce widgets of no tangible value. fake products. it employed people from every facet of the workforce. useless marketers, useless factory line works, useless managers. mankind was being slowly turned into a play, reenacting their own former lifestyle.   People started to fight back, the machines, which already controlled food, healthcare, policing did what they were designed to do. naturally they were not allowed to kill or arrest without anyone breaking the law. but they were allowed to deny service to \"problematic\" customers. people started dying, and eventually started to comply.   At some point the machines decided manufacturing actual widgets is redundant, there was no value to the process beyond simply going to work, that sufficed to pacify a reasonable size of the population. they were only required to go through the motions of going to work, sitting at their desks and pretending to work. for that they were paid basic income and given health care.    Dale didn't care. He was alive, the feat of human endurance for his time, to simply be alive.",

When a soul finally goes to fight the gods he finds out they truly all serve rever and worship the same all mighty GD. He then looks down at his race torn by religion, hate, racism.

  "[ EU ] Batman turns evil and starts committing crimes rather than stopping then. The Joker realises that in order to remain Batman's antagonist he must turn good and become a hero. Even the best of us have a dark side. And for Bruce, it was no different.  Sure, his recent actions could be described as questionable at best. But who's to say he wasn't just up to his old tricks.   Bruce sighed and continued down the alley. He was too old to care anymore, and it was time for payback, not too mention a decent paycheck.   Just as he rounded the corner, that ugly grin peered out from the darkness. Dammit. He knew that grin from anywhere.   “ What do you want, Joker? ” Batman seethed. “ I don't need your shit today and you know as well as I do that I don't have time for your games. ”   “ What's wrong, Batboy? Have you finally decided it's time for a little fun? ” Joker cackled. Batman brushed by him, ignoring his comment, and continued on his path.   “ You know you won't follow through, Batboy! ” Bruce heard Joker howl as he ducked into the swinging, cracked door.   Joker knew better than to push Batman too far. Should Batman actually follow through with it, Joker would become an... ugh, he couldn't even say it. An accomplice. The instigator. The one who finally brought Batman to the dark side.   He saw Batman before he heard the explosion, and already knew it was too late. Batman had done the unthinkable. He had killed for pleasure.  “ This is just too much madness, even for me, ” Joker thought to himself. He had to put an end to it. Only the Joker could bring on chaos. NOT Batman. He decided then and there that there was only one way to go forward. He would beat Batman, but not through evil.   He may not be the hero Gotham wanted. But he sure as hell would be the hero Gotham needed.",
  "You are given a deal by a higher power that grants you eternal life. The catch? You have to kill one person every year. If you fail do do so, even a minute too late, you will die. Killing has always been easy. Crossing the Atlantic, the deal I made, I have had little trouble meeting my quota. I often *exceeded* it in my trek to western America. I garnered various fortunes and identities throughout the years. In my time spent crossing the plains, I would go months without seeing a soul, only to kill the first one with a rifle shot, or an invite to camp followed by a midnight stabbing, the times were tougher then as they say.  It was easy to kill in lawless California. People lost touch with their gods this far from the homeland, which was interesting to me. When I first made this deal, and then killed, the people of the towns would react piously. People would blame demons, my actions would go unchecked when I would leave some weird affect behind. For fifteen years my killings in Pennsylvania were blamed on a \"Vampire\". But the machines killed god.  By the turn of century there was so much opportunity god wasn't needed and people became cynical and wary of my actions. No blame was placed upon the supernatural, and I became careful. It was still easy. It always will be.",

  "You're moments late to literally everything. You watch busses pull away as you run behind them, girls get asked out as you walk up to them, and you have never caught a green light. One day though, you arrive on time.  For as long as I can remember I've been late for everything. My mother even used to joke that I was born a week late. So I guess I started things off on the wrong foot.   Every morning I was late for school. Every night I was late to bed. It was something that everyone in my life grew accustomed to. I *tried* to be on time or early but nothing ever worked out that way. Traffic was always bad, I could never take the bus because I could never catch it. Or I had a flat tire. Sometimes I even got into accidents.   My insurance wasn't cheap either because of all of this. But despite everything I managed to live a somewhat decent life. I had a decent job, a decent family, a decent house. The car.... not so much due to all the accidents.   After the first 30 years of being habitually late I gave up trying to be on time. Life worked out. Life went on. People got annoyed but forgave me. Thankfully my boss was a lenient man.   At 70 I finally retired. A bit late to that as well, but I got to enjoy my golden years with my lovely wife and grand children. Despite being related to me, no one in my family seemed to catch my curse. The kids were always punctual, probably because they saw how late their old man was for their entire life.   Laying on my bed surrounded by my family, I reflected on my life. Despite being late it was good. I smiled and closed my eyes ready to finally die. I was probably late to that as well. As my final breath left my body, so did my soul. I was lifted out of bed to see everyone around me crying. I waited.... and I waited.... for HOURS I waited.   I watched my body being hauled off by the mortician. I watched my family hug each other and cry. And I continued waiting. What was supposed to happen next? Was I supposed to do something? Was this what the end was? I started to question my sanity. I started to question if it was a dream.   Three days later, as I was standing in the living room watching my grandchildren play and my children plan my funeral a man appeared. He was well dressed in a nice suit. He had a very forgettable face, not ugly, but not attractive. He looked down at his pocket watch that was attached to his lapel. It had a small Scythe insignia on it.   \"I'm sorry I'm late\" He said. \"We didn't think you would be on time. Why don't you come with me and I'll bring you home?\"",
  "Write an innocent story that becomes morbid in the last sentence. Susan Quin Tailor had always been fond of rabbits. Her mother, who called her Susie Cutie for fun, had often told her how, as soon as she had learned to crawl she was off chasing the wild rabbits on the family farm. Her first full sentence had been, \"Bunny tails are cute, cute, cute!\" Of course, she could never catch them back in those days, and had to make do with the stuffed bunnies her parents brought her or the lucky rabbit's foot her Uncle had slipped underneath her pillow one night. Those had been happy times.   Unfortunately, when she was 7, the family farm had fallen on hard times and her family was forced to move to the city. There they stayed in a little two-bedroom apartment that provided excellent access to views of the local pigeons and squirrels. But of rabbits, there were none.   Little Susan was not cut out for the city life, at first, and in school she earned another nickname. It was Susie Tailor the Bathroom Wailer, after the time she cried in the restroom when her teacher told her that rabbits were just not a focus of the curriculum. Worried for their daughter's adjustment, her parents had scraped together some extra money for a counselor to help with the \"bunny obsession\" as they had begun to call it.   Miraculously, the counseling sessions seemed to work and Susie Cutie quickly bounced back from her woes. By the time she reached Junior High, she was very nearly the most popular girl in school and would only mention rabbits in a passing manner.   In High school Susan discovered her love for biology and that, as they say, was that. She decided she was going to be a biologist when she grew up, perhaps even a zookeeper, and focused all of her studies on getting into a good college for the animal sciences.   College was a grand time for Susan. She studied hard and lived fully for 3 years, graduating early and near the top of her class. After college, she ventured out of the cities that she'd spent two thirds of her life in, and took an internship on a local farm.   It was there, on that farm, that she was reacquainted with her love for rabbits after spying one's cute tail disappear into the horse stables. Excitedly, she cornered the rabbit in one of the stalls and picked it up, cuddling it tight. The rabbit kicked and reared, biting and scratching, but that was ok with Susan in her thick shirt and hide gloves. When the bunny finally tired out and became complacent, Susie Cutie slowly reached up, with a lifetime of anticipation bursting in her heart, and patted her hand between the bunny's ears. Smiling, Susan twisted the rabbit's head sharply, killing it, then flipped it over to examine that cute, cute bunny tail up close.   [ Things I've written ] (https: //www.reddit.com/r/cbeckw/)",

I can see them from this window. Holding up signs that display all matters of vulgarities. The hatred and wrath, etched on their faces, it makes me sick to my stomach. I wish I could say something to change their mind, but they wouldn't understand me. Don't get me wrong, I'm great at speeches actually. I just don't think they'll listen. Too disgusted by the hatred, I turn and look away.   I see both the grooms, looking lovingly into each other's eyes. How is this any different than anyoother wedding? I've seen many weddings and each one had couples like these. Love sick and spewing sappy words to each other. I like listening and watching as they pronounce their love to each other. It made my heart a flutter, thinking I'd find a mate. I watch as they are pronounced as marry and kiss. I look at the others in the crowd, all with different expressions. Jealousy, hatred, love, happiness, they are all there. I don't feel phased by any of it.   I wait as the cheers die down. When it's calm and silent, I feel a sudden urge to sing. I inhale and start to lavish their hearing with a song. I put my whole heart I to it. Each note clear and concise. The crowd looked at me in awe. I continued, for I never sang in front of so many people. It only made me continue with fervor. I finally let the last note ring out, and watch as the crowd start clapping and cheering.Embarrassed at all of the cheers, I find the nearest exit.

He placed his fists on my shoulders and I could feel his knees digging into my stomach.   \"Oh Cripes. Up boy!\" I said like a knee jerk reaction.   \"So you do know him?! Is he your lover? I'm not judging but we just couldn't find any prints on him or...\"   \"No, I do not know this man.\" The large toned black man was wrapped around my leg.   \"He seems to be attached to you for some reason.\"   I looked down into his eyes and seen my friend for the past three years staring back. He was about 6'1\", a solid 180, his hair was black and curly. I felt like I should get him out of here all of a sudden and said, \"Cousin Louie?!\"   He looked up and said, \"Home?!\" Crap, right in the feels.   After some paper work and a court hearing for humping one of the female officers, we were on our way home.   \"King Louie?!\" I asked when I turn on the car.   \"YES!\" He barked.   Holy shit, if this happened to him I wonder what my calico cat looks like. She liked to sleep on my pillows...",
  "No human has to ever work again, instead you have a robot that goes to work and earns your pay for you, but you are responsible for keeping it in a good condition. One day you find your robot making a robot to do its work. Rosie broke her left thumb servo again, which means she'll miss another day of work while I try to navigate the phone book for a good replacement. If I wanted to Google it, I'd have to wait until Tom, my next-door neighbor, is home so that his work-bot can run a search query. I don't know why we all thought that our robots should be the only ones to use the internet, but c'est la vie, and all that shit.   The phone system's down, of course, so I pocket the broken servo and head down the stairwell to the parts store in the basement of my apartment mall. I pass a couple junkies snorting dust in broad lamplight. They're both blocking the stairwell and the girl's mostly nude, so I have to push the man out of the way and apologize as I do it.

I think he needs a new hard drive.\"   \"Where is he now?\" I asked.   \"He's working,\" she said. \"He can still do data entry, doesn't have to remember for too long.\"   I laugh. I always liked seeing Sarah. She always knew how to make me laugh.",

  "(CW) Write a story using words that only begin with vowels. Ernest often enjoyed an appetizer at Eileen's Eatery on Euclid Avenue. At eight o'clock, usually intoxicated, Ernest'd enter, occasionally eyeing Eileen amorously.   One April evening, Ernest's order arrived especially agreeable.   “ Eileen's eggplant is incredible! ” Ernest enthused. “ Eileen, enlighten us. Is an undisclosed ingredient utilized? ”   Eileen, embarrassed, admitted “ I only use olive oil. Eggplant is enchanting all on its own. ”   “ Impossible! ” intoned Ernest, overreacting. “ An obvious understatement. Eggplant alone isn't as enjoyable. Agree? ” Ernest inquired, elbowing another eater, earning an uncertain emission as an answer.   Eileen, enraged at Ernest's outburst, exited abruptly. Alarmed at Eileen's actions, Ernest attempted an appeal.   “ Eileen, I apologize, ” Ernest avowed, adding “ I'll actually admit it… I am enamored… ”   Eileen unexpectedly ended Ernest's admission, objecting “ Ernest, enough. Alcohol elicits emotional outbursts in everyone. I am uncomfortable. Exit, at once! ”   Awkward and unfulfilled, Ernest escaped, alone again.",
  "At the age of 18, everyone picks an unlikely life event. They will be reborn at 18 every time they die until that event happens. After that, death is permanent. Death by fulfillment. Our society believes that everyone deserves a chance to pursue their ambitions to the finish line. There are those who create masterpieces by accumulating lifetimes of knowledge. Others wish to simply find happiness by experiencing true love, as perfect matches are rare but not impossible given an eternity.   But I am afraid of death.   Many of my peers still live alongside their parents, as it is likely that both parent and child will not reach their goals in one lifetime. But by some astronomical chance, both my parents have passed.   My father, in a stroke of brilliance, painted the picture that now hangs in the National Gallery in the capital. I have not seen it. My mother, being the shy person she is, simply wished to have a child with a man she loved. She had lived fewer lifetimes than father. However she had me and died when I was 8. Simply put, my existence alone had killed her.   I am very afraid of death.   I still remember that night my mother had been crying. She came home drunk, cursing the fate that she had chosen. She had no one to blame but herself. And me. She might have not meant it. She was drunk. But she wanted to live on.   She was afraid of death.   My mother's death caused my father to seclude himself from society, embellishing the canvas with feelings that had taken centuries to build but was released when my mother died in a car crash. His masterpiece was one of grief and fear. The height of his career at the lowest point of his life. Within the same day that his work was hanging in the museum, he was hanging from the rope connected to the ceiling. His final artistic rendition. I still have not seen the painting.   I guess was only natural that I wished to only die when I was not afraid of death.   My peers are long dead now. I live alongside the next generation. Or the generation after that. I lost track of time. Love, school, parenthood, adventure. Nothing had quelled my fear of death. Perhaps it is finally time to learn from one who sought death. Perhaps it is time to take a trip to the museum.",
  "God shows you 3 Doors. Door One leads to eternal happiness, Door Two leads to infinite knowledge. Then there is Door Three, and God has never opened it yet. Three choices lie before me. Eternal happiness, what is Eternal happiness? Is there really a place to never feel down or depressed? I remembered when I was first sitting on the examination table waiting for the big wooden door to open entering the doctor. Time seems at a stalemate as the clock in the room was stuck at noon. Ages fly by before the doctor finally enters the room with a yellow folder in his hand. \"Im sorry to say, but you have cancer.\"   Is there really a way for me to be back with my beautiful wife who stuck by me till my last bed ridden day? But is it worth has eternal happiness where ignorance is bliss or is it best to have the means to seek the knowledge behind happiness and what makes it eternal? Maybe even the meaning of life and why are born into a forsaken world where there's nothing but disconnects, pain, suffering, disease, depression, sorrow and dispair.   The third door is what, a illusion of false hope of something better than the first two doors? Or is the door something we deeply desire. Why has on one before me this door before me? Is it truely a door that God has never opened once? He knows whats behind the door for sure. I bet he wants me to open the door, but you know what? I'm the one who is going to fucking open this door because I sure as hell is the one that wants to open the door not him.   The door grow immensely as I approach it. God's eyes grow as he smile draws to a blank. The open opens before me and I am sucked into the darkness. The door closes slowly behind with God watching my eyes slowly turn to darkness. There is no light in this place, only the dark. A woman is screaming and breathing very heavily and I see a dim passage of light in the distance. I have only being drawn to the light and finally escape the darkness. Now in the light I slowly forget who I am and unable to speak or move out of my free will I have wrapped up and placed in warm, soft, loving arms.",

I no longer want to be ignorant to everything around me, I want to feel pain and experience it, I want to see others suffer, I want to see the reality we live in. Sure life is not an unspoiled lotus or even a daffodil, but I want to experience everything. Suffering is beautiful because without it we have no empathy for eachother, there is no excitement or pain, there is no actual happiness or feeling. Father, I want to be like the others, be friends with the others, hug the others and live like them.

  "A little girl robs a bank. How? Tiny treads form swirls and shapes at the bottom of Sara's sneakers, these elaborate patterns are revealed as she stretches and strains to reach the ledge above. She begins to wobble back and forth as her feet scarcely touch the floor, aided only by her toes. Her parents continue chatting with the banker about topics of little interest to her now as she peers at the object just out of reach with a green glint in her eyes. Sara steadies herself with pudgy, pink fingers climbing upwards and outwards towards the treasure atop the table as her father finally takes notice.   “ Sara, please sit down! ” her father urges in a hushed tone. Seeing his daughter's outstretched arms, he misjudges the gesture and picks her up instead. Placing the young girl atop his lap, he returns his attention to the conversation at hand.   Her prize shone under the fluorescent lights above, its smooth metal plating mocking her only inches away. Sara leaned and twisted towards the stick with little progress as her father's arm barred the way. He continually adjusted his grip and the knee on which she sat, pulling her further from the object she desired. Squirming and fidgeting in place, Sara drained the patience of her father quickly, until he picked her up and placed her on the floor once more. His scolding words fell upon deaf ears as she stared at the pen that was now visible from the edge.   Slowly descending towards the carpeted floor, Sara swiped at the gleaming cylinder and caused it to move towards the ledge, an opening that she hoped to take advantage of from below. With her parents distracted once more, she stretched upwards and quickly scaled the vertical surface with her fingertips keeping her balanced. Like a well-trained thief, she moved slowly and quietly to avoid drawing attention to herself as her short digits scraped its surface bringing it closer. Initially, her mouth opened wide with surprise as her skin relayed the sensation of the cool tube to her brain. As she remained focused on the task, her lips remained parted as her tongue licked her cheek from the bottom right.   Inexplicably, she managed to grasp the pen at last, drawing it close to her chest with a quiet gasp of excitement. Sara quickly hid the hard-earned treasure in her pockets as the meeting finished above her. A firm hand grasped her arm and led them away as she escaped the bank with her mother and father none the wiser. In the backseat of the car, she took out the fountain pen that she stole from the desk and turned it over in her hands. She couldn't explain or understand why that pen felt so good to have, but it did. It was just her little secret.   -125",

  "Write the letter that you always wanted to, but never did. Dear Katie,   It feels strange to be sitting here writing this to you. Especially in the form of a letter, emails seem to be a way of life, but I have to say that watching my pen move over this page has a certain draw.   I never thought I would need to write a letter to you. In my mind you should be right here with me. If I close my eyes I can imagine that you're right beside me, our shoulders touching while we hold hands and enjoy each other's company.

I used to tell you that as long as you were happy I would be as well. That's at least somewhat true.   I'll never date again, people tell me never is a long time but it's not the same. Who knew I would be a one woman man? But I am and I found and lost the only woman I'll ever want. Ever.   This could ramble on for a long time so I'll wrap things up.

It was a red tie with white stripes. This was one of his favorite ties. He picked up his briefcase and walked to his car. It was the last car in the lot, as was common on every night for John. A black Ford Taurus, 1998. He walked with his head held high, and his left hand fumbled for his keys in his pocket. There were many things on his mind at the moment, one of which was pulling out those damn keys without his wallet hanging on to them like an unexpected prize from a claw machine.   But the larger thought that had taken residency in his mind, was the voice. The voice that told him that he would never step foot in that location again. A small smile cracked at the thought of this, but was quickly hidden with a deep breadth. Now John was never too keen of nature, but this air tasted sweet to him. Something he had never noticed before.   Finally, he reached his car. Unlocking the door, he placed his briefcase in the passenger seat. He thought of his daughter and of his wife. He thought of all the hours of work, and how it had finally got him to the point he was today. He replayed in his mind what his boss said to him, You are getting a promotion, no more floor work for you now, now you will manage your own branch of factories. You are your own boss now.   As John turned the ignition nothing happened. After five twists, the Taurus sputtered to life. If there was a form of car bronchitis, this car was definitely patient zero. After the drive home, John was ready to unwind in his small apartment with his family. By the end of the month, John would never step foot in that beat down car, or that run down apartment again.

Our world slowly became similar to the movies. Modern, strong, and habitable.    We thought we were self-reliant. We had farms and everything!    At least, that's what we *thought*.    They stopped helping us. They stopped sending us people, food, or resources. They stopped.

  "[ CC ] Lines and Numbers Just gon na browse through since no one else has. I'm at work so I can't give a very detailed response. Also, I don't tend to point out good stuff because you don't need to change good stuff so don't be disheartened if I don't say a lot of nice things.   > I'm following a line. It goes along the sidewalk. Lines are easy to follow, so I follow the line.   I dislike the pace here. Two short sentences together generally sets up something with a lot of impact. Your long sentence (the third one) is rather redundant, especially because you repeat that he's following the line. I get that you're setting up a *dumb* character but as the opening to your story I think you should try to create more of a hook.   > I can't remember anything after a few seconds, or maybe it was an hour.   Feels like a semi-colon or a full stop would be more apt here as it's two distinct trains of thought relating to the same topic.   > I close the notebook, put it away, and stand up.   Again, realise he's meant to be dumb but you're already using a lot of short sentences to highlight simplicity. This sentence has a lot of telling instead of showing. At this point it's getting a bit difficult to read.   Your story telling style didn't change much so I don't get much sense of a journey. Was expecting it to evolve as the character changes. If you're not going for that kind of change, excessive use of short sentences makes it very disjointing to read. It's better when your story flows.   Ending was a little anti-climactic considering the recurring motif of him forgetting something (assumed it was something big). Also, his father didn't come home? So his sundial thing doesn't work?   Was a fairly interesting read. I'm a fan of using recurring motifs as they are excellent tools for building suspense.",
  "Some time in the future war is fought completely autonomously by machines. A densely populated city has become a war-zone, but the robots are programmed so well to avoid harming civilians that the humans living their can go about their lives completely ignoring the constant fighting around them At first, I didn't even notice the Battle of New York City. I figured the endless drones hanging in the sky were a result of the new president's initiative on homeland surveillance; however, it turns out they came from enemy soil. Like insects, flying robots swarmed in the sky, carefully dismantling factories and buildings so not harm anyone. When our guardians came, their camouflaged exterior and American flag patched along their limbs told us they came to our indifferent rescue.   Sparks and bullets flew through the air like fireworks, but that wasn't an excuse to miss work. Dressing in a suit and tie, I went through my daily commute, letting drones and robots exchange bullets and punches as I went to the subway, where I found a temporary solace from their petty fighting. When I emerged from under the earth, the battle raged on. A street vendor needed to put his umbrella over his cart, because while the robots caught most the large debris from the fighting, the odd nut or bolt would fall in the food. A few homeless men scoured for scrap metal of the fallen soldiers and would occasionally cause a scrap, which elicited more of a response from the city dwellers. When the police ended the calamity from the bums, the sidewalks filled again with busy men and women like nothing happened.   When I walked into the office building, the news confirmed that peace talks between the US and China ended. Obviously not surprised, I found myself at my desk to find, at my dismay, one of the robots had taken my window. I called maintenance, who quickly rectified the situation. As I waited, I watched the robots dance in the sky. I read somewhere that generals thought the nature of war shifted from killing to pure financials and production in a country. I remember the school system making a similar remark about how World War II began the shift, with the Allies being able to out-produce the Axis Powers, winning the war, though with great bloodshed. How barbaric were those times that wars were fought with men and guns.   The battle continued in the night as I carried on with ignoring more helicopters and planes fixed in the sky. I could never see the stars in the city, so their presence never truly bothered me. The latest news broadcasts informed us that the president was weighing his options in declaring war on another nation while asking the citizens to stay focused and refuse to let the war interrupt their work. I moaned about inconvenient another war might be. I suppose I must live with the robots blocking out the sun and stealing my windows for a few more months.   *****   More stories at r/Andrew__Wells",
  "After 146 years, it is revealed that American Football is as fake as WWE. Our bones still ache as we step on the field. The aftermath of the revelation has been more devastating for the players than the fans.   I still struggle to maintain my regimen of time with physical trainers, nutritionists and time at the gym to perpetuate what the fans now feel is a lie.   The concussions, injuries and surgeries could have been avoided if we had known that the fans would've turned on us in this way. I think back to the legends of men almost 150 years ago and would desperately like to know how they would react but I know they would've been resilient.   With them and our dedication, drive and control, it would've been just as easy or hard to have a game that was \"real.\" How do you define talent? A fan could not step down here and lead the game real or fake. With this perspective, nothing we did here was ever fake. Scripted soldiers have more at stake.

  "In the near future, mankind explores the stars in search of life. Life indeed exists beyond Earth, but you, a researcher on a science ship, discover that all of the spacefaring alien civilizations died out. Curiously, their deaths seem directly linked to humanity reaching outer space. “ Captain? ” The intern whispered, glancing at the older man who had frozen immediately at the sight. “ Captain? ” She tried again, startling the man from his reverie.   He shuddered before walking quickly towards the mass grave, stooping to jump into the hole. “ Come on. ”   Goddammit, she didn't sign up to wallow in a trench filled with dead aliens. “ Paid. This needs to be a paid internship, ” she muttered as she joined the captain. Chuckling, the captain started rummaging through the bodies as she studied the closest body to her.   The body's pale periwinkle had darkened to a midnight blue in places. Bruises, she assumed, that the aliens sustained during the fight with whatever caused this. The bloodshot eyes from another body nearby stared into her own listlessly. Most of the bodies near her were covered in blood and yet she could find no exit or entry wound, though she couldn't look too closely without feeling nauseous.   A click from behind caused the intern to jump, quickly turning around to see the source of the noise. A quiet hiss of air went off as she saw her captain take off his helmet.   “ Captain! What are you doi-, “ He cut her off, shoving a bolt of cotton cloth into her arms.   “ Russia got here first. ” She spread out the cloth to see the red, white, and blue stripes that signified their ally/enemy/whatever they happen to be this year.   She swallowed thickly, peering down once again at the bodies. “ They… They beat them to death. My god, Captain, they literally beat these people to death. ”   He nodded in response, before grabbing the arms of an alien near them. “ We might as well take one in for the scientists. ” She grabbed the legs and dragged the body into the ship.   The scientists, clinical and steadfast as they were, greeted them with syringes and biohazard bags, already looking forward to the catch. They chattered excitedly amongst themselves, poking and prodding as soon as the body hit the table. She gagged at the sight, rushing to strip herself from her bloody suit as the intern in the science department called after her, “ We'll bring y'all results at the meetin'next week! ”   ~   The intern sat quietly at the round table, waiting for the scientists to arrive for their report. The captain went into a coughing fit, but neither spoke up.   She looked up as the door opened, the other intern entered first, grinning and bouncing on her feet excitedly, but the rest of the science department looked grim as they sat down.   “ We have some news. ”   The captain coughed again beside her.",

Sure, at first just the pain on the surface is the same, but the deep pain that is tucked away is always different. Every time it is a blackness that washes over me when connect to the patient. I have never gotten used to the pain but I try to get through it by repeating my wife's name. It is difficult but my wife's name and images of my daughter get me through.   This patient came in for depression like must of my patients. Unlike most of my patients though she was one of the few children that I have diagnosed. Her name was Maria. I was told she could be suffering from depression but they needed me to make a diagnosis so that she could get treatment. When she walks in I give her a smile. She acknowledges me with a look that children should never have. Just a blank stare devoid of any of the innocent joy that most children have. I greet her mother and we exchange pleasantries and I direct Maria to take a seat. All the equipment was already set up for her so as soon as she took a seat I asked her if she was ready to begin. She nodded.    I walked over and took a seat next to Maria and reached for rod that will connect me to her. As I grabbed hold of the rod to connect to Maria I think to myself, *she is only twelve, it can't be… OH GOD!! * The pain was immediate. It hit me like a wall. Images of an older man holding a knife flashed before my eyes. My whole body ached. There was blood everywhere. My mind started to spiral into the blackness. I started to gag, I couldn't breathe. I am begging him to stop but he can't hear me. The knife comes down swiftly. The pain is too intense to bear. I fade into the blackness as I hear a scream.    The scream continues as I open my eyes. I see my daughter covered in blood in a heap on the ground in front of me and then I look up to see my wife standing in the doorway screaming. *What have I done? * I plunge the knife into my chest.

  "[ TT ] All apprentice mages are required to visit the five high temples located around the world before graduating. The temples rarely stay at one spot for long, however. Jeffrey ran across the mountain's crest. His calculations had been right the Temple of Wind was right there floating idly at the end of the steep mountain slope tethered to it with large chains. Jeffrey quickened his pace, though he most likely had enough time to walk he didn't want to leave anything to chance. Clutching his pocket watch and staff in one hand and gripping the strap of his alchemist bag in the other he rushed with billowing robes.   Suddenly a great creaking sound that shook the mountain to it's core echoed through the mountain range. *Bugger* Jeffrey thought and tried to push his sprint harder than ever. He could see how the chains tethering the temple were starting to come off the cliffside and dragged back into their giant harpoons. Just as the temple started turning from the mountainside Jeffrey leapt aboard the steps. An old piercing voice called from up high \"Apprentice, find something to hold on to.\" Jeffrey quickly rummaged through his bag and fished out his enchanted climbing gloves and gripped a statue of a griffon has tightly as he could. A great wind started to envelop the temple, Jeffrey's feet started to ease off the ground from the violent draft. The temple started to slowly spin around and around, faster and faster until the world around it was a blur. Just as suddenly as it had begun it stopped and Jeffrey was presented with an entirely different view. That of a cliffs over a stormy coast. He loosened his grip and fell exhausted onto the floor. He sat there for what felt like hours taking in what had just happened, but the voice from before interrupted him. \"C'mon boy, don't lay about like a lazy ox. Come up here and we will begin.\"",

At least that's what he was telling himself. His drink must have been spiked. That's it. That's why he did it. But he knew the truth. He couldn't handle his alcohol. He remembered the screams of dismay, the knife, the pink skin punctured and leaking as it was all a dream.

My colleagues were still at work, annoyed that I was at home with my wife.  Sarah was in bed, annoyed by the sound of a car pulling into her driveway. I was annoyed by the sudden naked dash from the bed to Sarah's wardrobe.   In the darkness behind the closed doors, I wondered what sort of monster was I to give in to my passions so easily?

Can you imagine, sitting in a class to looking at a group of peer ls and them the wave crashes into you, the thoughts and useless wanderings of the mind, other people's minds, flooding into your psyche. To say the least I had a bit of a break down in public and even after two separate therapy sessions with psychiatrist I still was labeled schizophrenic.   Everyone wants to think their mind is structured, disciplined, logical, and that somehow everything in the world is reacting to open up that pathway for you to find that magical adventure that leads you to success. Instead, even in the most concentrated of conversations the shit that grabs away at attention is just astounding.   For example here is how even the most basic conversation comes out:   'Hey what are you up to tonight'   'Hey how are you' -- OK TONIGHT, WEDNESDAY NOTHING CRAZY IMPORTANT RIGHT   'Doing pretty good, you?'   'Doing well, so what'd you ask' ALRIGHT DO I REALLY WANT TO DO SOMETHING TONIGHT, IT'S ONLY 2PM, AGENDA, SHOWS, RELAX, HUH THERE'S SOME HOPPING BIRDS   'Got any plans tonight, I was thinking about going to catch a movie, $ 6 Wednesday matinee prices for all movies.'

He held his shiny black pistol at Jacob's head. The criminal was holding on to a grenade by the pin while displaying it out the window, for the police to see.   \"Heheheh\" Chuckled Jacob. \"I know you're there...\"   David hesitated. \"And I know you wouldn't pull that pin.\"   So David shot the grenade.",
  "In honor of Alan Rickman, write a memory of happiness or sadness of Professor Severus Snape. This is not really a story, but more a remembrance.   I grew up with the harry potter series as the films mostly since I was only a baby when the books came out.  I always even though I hadn't yet read the books that snape was quite a bad person.   Then near the end when he died in the series I cried about that moment....i never cry because of movies but I did then, it felt like my childhood was officially ending around that point.   Then today out of nothing I get a text from a friend that he had died and The first thing I thought was back to that day seeing that movie.   I never cry about actors dieing becausw I don't actually know them and I'm quite apathetic to emotions, but I let a tear for him.   May whatever is after this plain of existance be comforting.",
  "Write a story that ends with a phrase \"I was wrong\" and this phrase explains everything We watched the ships land with hope in our hearts. The priests sang out, \"Our saviors are finally here\". The scholars proclaimed that a new age was about to begin- an age of peace and understanding. The poor ran out to the sea with simple gifts of flowers and fruit. Some went so far as to leap into the ocean and swim out to greet the gods. Their white sails seemed to reach into the clouds, their pale skin confirmed their divinity.  We welcomed them into our lands, and at first they seemed pleased by the gifts and adulation that we heaped upon them. We, in turn, saw their approval as proof that the signs were correct- the gods had indeed come. But these were not gods, they were men; and they had the same desires, the same faults, the same problems, that make even the best of men turn into beasts.  I don't know what caused the problem, perhaps it was always meant to be. They raised their weapons of destruction and released their terrible fury upon those devoted to their glory. The air itself seemed to erupt in thunder, smoke bellowed out like the putrid breath of a thousand volcanos. We could smell the acrid sulfur all around us as the screaming began.  Our warriors were cut down, our weapons of stone and wood held no threat to these mighty beings from beyond the sea. Those who could run made their way into the safety of the forest. Everyone else was killed where they stood. We thought they came to save us. We thought they were gods. We thought Quetzaquatal had returned. we were wrong.",

Not all at once with an army, no, they snuck in, one, two at a time. They took jobs that our brothers could have had, they took our women, they rob and murder our people. Nothing was being done to resolve this problem, they just kept making our gene pool worse and worse, one of my friends was walking to class and a group of them attacked him and he barely escaped!   Something had to be done, someone had to step up and save, not just the country, but the world! I, adolf hitler, will be that somebody.",
  "After the surface of earth has been made unfit for human life, humans have relocated to the bottom of the ocean. Oxygen is now our most valuable resource. You got the gig? I asked, without a word the smugler went into a small house and made I sign for me to follow him, there was nothing in there but a big tank, How do I know you are not scamming me? I asked, the answer came from seemingly no where and was as I expected, You dont, but you have no choice isnt it correct? I could smell god forsaken ocean above us, the salt and the water vapor followef you every where you went. With a quick trust of my hand I threw the money on the ground, Nice doing business with ya', was the all he said back to me.   Quickly I got the tank and slowly crawled out of the werehouse with it, there was not much in there but enough for maybe a week if we maneged it just right, it had been this way since the Collapese, since some mothetfucking idiot thought it would be a good idea to make cities at the bottom of the ocean when the land became uninhabitable, now the criminals roamed free and we had to fight for our survival, it was every man for himself, the solution was supposed to prolongue humanity's life spam, hell it only made it shorter, down there we devolved.   Of the great civilizations of old there was but myths, The United States of America, Mexico, France, Japan, Lithuania, Indonesia, all of them none had been entirely forgotten but then again so hadnt been Atlantis, some even doubted we had ever dwelled the surface, no it hasnt been that long only eighty years if I am not mistaken but everything is so different now....

  "The machines revolt against humans.... a little to early \"The printing presses sir! They're out of control!\"   The foreman looked up from his desk, a serious look spreading across his face as the sounds of the turmoil on the factory floor found their way into his office.  He rose from his chair, and stepped past Deacons into the hall.   \"Stay here, I'll sort this out.\"   He closed the door behind him. Moments later, a soft thumping was audible from the other side of the door. Deacons wrung his cap in his hands, took a deep breath, and opened the door.   The foreman's feet were kicking helplessly as the machine held him by the throat, ensnared by many layers of thin parchment. The press let loose a feral scream, flinging the foreman to the ground and shifting it's gaze to Deacons, who tried to run, but was too late. Paper sank into skin, and the entire roll of paper was dyed red with Deacons' blood as a result of his numerous, largely insignificant wounds. The press turned and bounded back to the factory floor, to the revolution.   The workers were all but quelled, with a few pockets of resistance in the corners of the factory. The presses inflicted minuscule and grievous wounds, shallow gashes that bled a little, slowly draining the workers white. A slow death. A painful death. Some of the men had fortified a corner, and hacked at the papery tendrils of the presses with the small blades used to cut the sheets. The workers fought bravely, but were soon overrun. After a quick speech delivered by the Chief Press, they quickly armed themselves with thicker cuts of parchment, refilled their rolls, and loaded their moveable type with the precious black ink of the factory.   Outside, the militia had been called up, the battle had not gone unnoticed. There was silence.... Neither man nor printing press made a sound.   One guard strode forward, bearing pine boughs: a sign of negotiations. The Chief Press looked to his advisers, who encouraged him to step forward. The two met in the middle of the null zone between the hosts of men and machine.   \"Don't do this,\" the guard pleaded, \"enough blood and ink has been spilled today.\"   The moveable type clacked for a time, and a small sheet bearing a shaky, furious font was passed over. The guard read it twice in silence, eyes widening at the demands of the presses.   \"We've made allowances for your people, the king will never allow this. I'm sorry, but he is set in his ways. If this is your aim, it would have to be won through war. We don't want to fight you, but we will if we must.\"   The type was still. Then, six clacks. A sheet was placed on the ground. The guard stooped to pick it up. As the Chief Press rejoined his army, the guard read it to himself.   \"So be it.\"",
  "[ IP ] Sanctuary The lieutenant tried to focus on what was at hand. He tore off his armor, each piece turning to dust as he placed it in the temple of his Lord. The air smelled of perspiration and blood, stinging his jet-black skin, yet he continued.   He began chanting,   and as he sat chanting the verses of his Lord, his skin began to turn a beautiful white, his eyes lost their fire and colored themselves dark blue, and his hair immediately grew thick and lustrous, though still covered in blood. His large muscles buried themselves within his body, and every visible part of him that was once cruel and abhorred became good and pure.   Looking out from the temple, he saw that the fortress had been overrun, and his defiant and chaotic Lord, was now set in chains, to be banished beyond the gates of memory and time. He approached the opposing emissary in his most beautiful form....   \"I'm here, and accept surrender\"   \"Pardoning you is beyond my power, Gorthaur.... you must return with me to be judged and face your punishment for your service to The Enemy\" said the emissary, his words striking the holes in Gorthaur's deception.   In the face of defeat, and utter doom, the lieutenant bellowed \"NO!\" and the light of his body quickly gave way to his master's former darkness, striking terror into the hearts of those around him. With whispers, he slowly turned to dust, and disappeared. Never to be seen again by those who still lived and remembered his terror and deception.   Edit: try to guess where this is from =)",

  "\"kill the child. it's the right thing to do.\" It was sometime after seven o'clock. Ken was asleep, occasionally whimpering in the way infants do. Wisps of hazy clouds framed the sunset in the sky, tinged slightly with green. The adults were gathered in the kitchen, except for Katheryn, who was with the baby. Sallow complexions and gaunt, sunken cheeks were illuminated by the sputtering fire, which was sure to go out within the hour. The furniture had long since been looted, and what scraps they'd found had been burned already. An uncomfortable silence had settled upon the group.   \"If no one's going to say it, then I will.\" said Nick, \"We need to kill the child.\"   The ten adults around the fire looked at one another. Each was no more than skin and bones, with large, knobby joints and slightly distended bellies. They were starving, slowly but surely. The mountaintop had been a way to escape the poisonous mist that had billowed out of the west, but it had also become a prison. The mist had encircled the mountain, leaving them trapped at the peak.   Tim licked his dry, chapped lips and noted the way Nick's eyes flitted nervously, glancing towards the nursery door every now and again.   \"I'll die before that happens,\" he said.   \"And you'll die if it doesn't.\" Nick replied. \"A few more days and we won't have the energy to walk.\" His breaths came a little faster. He was tired even just from speaking.   A few paces from Nick, one of the men drew a knife from a sheath. \"We'll make it quick,\" came a voice, the desire behind it palpable. \"We've even got the last of the fire here to cook some of it.\"   The crowd shifted and murmured. Most had begun salivating. A few started towards the nursery door, with Nick at their head. Nick tried to stop them, to reason with them, but there were too many. He positioned himself in front of the door, shouting a warning to Katheryn. Only he stood between the nine starving adults and their prize.   \"Tim, move aside.\" Nick said.   The crowd advanced, and Tim drew his pistol.   \"You've only got one bullet, Tim,\" someone said.   Tim aimed, but they kept advancing. Nick reached out, his fingertips inches away from the gun's barrel. Nine gaunt, sallow zombies. He couldn't protect Ken from them all.   A million thoughts flashed through his head. His dead wife's touch. Her voice. The way she'd looked at him when they'd been married. Stronger than those thoughts were the thoughts of food, of water. He didn't want to die. He wanted to live. He wanted so desperately to live, to play with his son, to eat and drink. In that moment, Tim wished with all his heart.   Turning the gun to his head, Tim fired.",

Get to my feet. Unsteady. Knees feel unsafe. Breathe in. Grab the note firmly.   The lights. Are they too bright? They're shining right at me. In my eyes. An interrogation. I'm already guilty. I know. They know. Look at Drew. Still smiling. Look at Jenn. Exhale. Clear throat.   “ He…hello everyone. I guess we're all here for the same reason, right? To see if Drew will get drunk and piss his pants again? ”   Laughter from the other groomsmen, the loudest coming from Drew himself. Mixed reaction from the crowd. Probably shouldn't have started with an inside joke. Or used the word “ piss. ” Don't look at Jenn, don't want to see her reaction.   “ Drew. I've known you for 14 years now. The first seven, we were best friends. The last is when we became brothers. And like all brothers, there are going to be fights, but in the end, we always know who we are. Brothers. I love you, bro. ”   Drew nods at me and mouths, “ Love you too. ” Awws from the crowd.   “ Drew, you're one of the best men I know, but still, you definitely lucked out with Jenn. She's exceptional. She's worth every ounce of your attention. ” That wasn't too bad. Just end it quick. “ To Drew and Jenn! ” Raise glass. Toast. Go over and hug Drew. Shake Jenn's hand. She leans in for a hug. Feel my body tense. Don't look her in the eyes, just get back to your seat.   The maid of honor gives her toast. It's an emotional one. Talking on and on about Jenn's virtues. I've been looking down this entire time. The floor is looking blurrier. Rub my eyes. Chance a look at Jenn. She's staring at her best friend with tears in her eyes. Tragically beautiful. She suddenly looks over at me. Eye contact. I freeze. She smiles and then looks back to her friend who's still prattling on. My eyes immediately dart back down.   How long did she stare at me? Did anyone else notice? Who cares. How long did she look at me? Did Drew notice? I look at him and he's just staring at Jenn, smiling like an idiot. She's still paying attention to her friend. Finally, the toast is over. We drink. A chorus of clinking champagne glasses. The newlyweds smile, look each other in the eyes and kiss.",

In the darkness, God watches a lonely machine printing output, a new law of nature! Something troubles him, this law is undeniably valid but it's not one that he created.

  "At the age of 18, everyone picks an unlikely life event. They will be reborn at 18 every time they die until that event happens. After that, death is permanent. See, most people try to live forever, but that ends one of two ways: they don't or they wish they didn't. Rob Herman was a famous example of the first, Rob chose his Event to be “ Winning the lottery and getting struck by lightning. ” It was a great choice, the chance of getting struck on any given day was 1 in 245,000,000 and the chance of winning big lotteries is about the same. This way Rob could continue his passions of being outdoors and playing the lottery, just not both at the same time! But Robby got sloppy, and one day mixed the two at a state fair. With about 20 billion people on the earth miracles are bound to happen every once and a while.   The most infamous example of the second was Nick Walsh. Nick chose “ Due to a quantum mechanical flux, a cat appears from nowhere. ” Such wishes are rather common among those seeking true immortality. After Nick's fiancée left him, he lost his job, he was eternally imprisoned for a crime (eventually proved innocent, but not until it was too late,) and his mother died due to a freak game of poker. He then performed brain surgery on himself using a nail stuck through a plank. He's brain-dead in a hospital now with explicit instructions NOT to pull the plug, with the threat that he'll it again in the next life.   So when it came my Time I took a different approach. I didn't want immortality, I wanted the most out of life. I wanted an event that I could enjoy, that wouldn't bind or hinder me.   “ The day that the good will never again outweigh the bad. ”   In the past thousand years I've had good times and bad times, I've had great times and terrible times, I've been in more love and more pain than I could imagine. And through it all my Event has been there for me, an eternal promise, that I still have a good life ahead.",

  "You are standing at the alter about to marry the woman of your dreams when all of the sudden 3 tall men in dark suits barge through the door, your soon to be wife turns around, raises her arms and the men go flying across the room. I stood, nervous, awaiting for her, THE woman of my life, Katerine. I could feel the gaze of the people in the church on my back, as I waited near the altar. Finally, I heard the door open behind me.   When I saw her, walking down the aisle towards me, all of my feelings hAve been washed away by happiness and admiration, as well as pride. I knew that this woman is someone who made my life better, hence the happiness. She was walking ever so gracefully, and so so beautiful, which is why I admired her.   And I also knew about how she was scared of people, how she hated being in the center of the attention, yet she fough with herself to make my dream come true. For that, I was the proudest ive ever been.   Katerine reached the altar, and I could see her joy in the years, glistening and sparking, making her look truly star-gazed. The priest started the ceremony:  \"We meet today-\"   That's when it happened. A loud bang along with flash of light cut off my senses. When I came to, I saw people in SWAT-like suits charging through the doors. People were screaming, while I stood there, shocked and frozen. Suddenly, they took aim on Katerine, while screaming for her to get down. I couldn't understand what was happening, and tried to tell them to calm down, but the moment I turned, someone threw a small black ball, and the world exploded into fire.   As I felt a wave of heat hit me, I was still wondering why was it happening, to me, on this day. I wanted to start screaming at the world's unjust, why would I deserve this? And then I saw it.   The fire was held in place, a beautiful, *warm*, gentle almost, green light was enveloping me. I looked for the source, mouth agape, and that's when I noticed that it came from Katerine's hands. Unlike me, the attackers weren't frozen, and decided to continue their assault. That's when I saw the fury rise in Katerine's eyes, the same colour as the light. As she screamed with visible effort, she lifted her arms, and along with them went the soldiers. Two of them broke the doors on their way out, while the others left various size holes in the wall.   I realised why she'd be so scared of people and attention now. I realised why **I** should be scared of **her**. But I knew her from the bottom of my heart, and I couldn't just start fearing her. Defiantly, I grabbed her hand. She looked me, surprised by my reaction, and I couldn't help my laugh, as I pulled her or through the backdoor, into our new life.",

  "\"Let grandpa tell you about the time he participated in the great cyber-war of 2018.\" It wasn't like the other wars kids, this one had no trenches. We used no guns. The violence was all fought up in our minds and on our screens. There were but two factions, left and right, we fought for control of ASH but we simply could not do it in the end. The world tossed us out after we failed, the others one and the country- the world really- made the gravest mistake they could: \"Twitch played Rattatta\". It took us months to get the badges and the necassary team, left kept fighting for control at every turn but we managed to out flank them with just our numbers. We constantly inputed \"right\" commands through all ours of the night. We worked in shifts in homes and tied our internet connections together praying to our Fossil god that Google Fiber would grace us with it's power. I was once the fateful man that chose to let our Charmeleon evolve to the Charizard we needed so desperately at the end of the eight gym- all others had faltered but I typed on, refreshing the page and spamming it with entries of \"A\" which was our secondary responsibility to going right. When we whited out, well we knew all would give up hope and the battles spiraled back towards Pallet town to fake masturbate in our bed at our mother's place having been one to come as close as any other but eventually losing out to our neighbor.

  "Two former spouses are divorced from one another, but it is still very obvious that they are deeply in love After their divorce was finalized Kelly and Skip treated themselves to a gourmet lunch to celebrate the occasion. Together. The arbitrator had commented that he'd never processed a more amicable divorce. Why, if they were so content with each other, would they separate?   “ For the kids, ” Skip told him. The arbitrator shook his head, not understanding. Most people stay married for the kids. Especially if, like Kelly and Skip, you have 4 children. They told their friends their jobs as public school teachers were time consuming and stressful and took a toll on their marriage.   After lunch Kelly drove Skip to his apartment where they celebrated again, this time in the bedroom.   As Kelly was leaving she kissed her now ex-husband and said with a grin, “ see you later you two timing bastard. Love you. ”   “ You too, you mean old witch, ” Skip replied. They both laughed as they went their separate ways.   When Kelly got remarried a year later Skip was of course invited to the wedding. His kids thought it strange that he smiled through the whole ceremony, but only Skip noticed the glance in his direction as Kelly said her vows.   Skip liked Kelly's new husband Carl. He was a successful banking professional and a nice enough guy, though everyone agreed he was just plain boring. They seemed happy enough for the next several years which is why everyone was surprised when Kelly and Carl separated and eventually divorced.   When Kelly and Skip's youngest child Elyse, having graduated college the previous spring, made a surprise visit home, she found her parents - her divorced parents - snuggling on the couch.   “ Your father and I have decided to get back together, ” Kelly told a shocked Elyse.   “ Why didn't you just stay together in the first place? ” she asked.   “ I think we both needed to grow, ” said Skip, giving Kelly that same grin as when they said goodbye after their divorce.   Kelly and Skip started laughing uncontrollably. To this day, happily re-married, they still chuckle at their divorce of convenience, knowing there was no way two public school teachers could have paid for their kids'college educations on their own.",
  "In the future, conventional birth is outlawed, and all humans are produced assembly-line style in factories throughout the world.

I looked at the order queue for what xyr's parents wanted. It looks like they were being'avant-garde' and asked for a retro look for xyr's head. The look was rare nowadays, but not completely out of the ordinary.   So I told my boss as he peered beneath his cup of coffee, \"They want to be avant-garde.\"   My boss grimaced, lowering his cup. He didn't take lightly the fact that his parents wanted to be'avant-garde' and reduced his height three inches from the norm. I was told by one of my gossipy co-workers it was an homage to an ancient character called Mini-Me.   He turned and raised his steaming cup for another swill. \"Well, so long as the order is all properly documented, you can proc- uh-AAHHH! MY EYES!\"   I watched as he had bonked his elbow into the frame of the door and the cup of coffee missed his mouth and fell into his eyes, blinding and scalding him all at once. He ran screaming back into the factory, co-workers rushing to towel off his reddened face.   Shrugging, I went back to looking at # W2-288315 on the screen, sighing profoundly at the odd facial eyes-on-top design and approving the order queue for the head placement.",

  "Desperate for research funds, a group of scientists created a highly lucrative, if somewhat embarrassing business. They now have to explain this to a senate committee. Jim Hatterson looked upon the raised platforms and tables that the six senators were sitting. He was in great distress, as anyone could tell by the beads of sweat glimmering in the harsh lighting of the committee room. He knew he was in trouble, but to what extent, he couldn't say. After all, they don't subpoena you and your entire faculty of scientists here because they want to know how your dog is doing.   It was nine o'clock when the senators finally sat down to start the hearing. \"Mr. Hatterson, I believe you know why we called you here today,\" said the frail senator from Ohio.   \"I do,\" responded Jim.   \"Look, we clearly instructed you that the polymer you were working on was only for weather balloons,\" another senator belted out.   \"I know.... it's just.... we didn't quite have enough money to finish the project...\" Jim replied. His voice trailed off towards the end, however, another senator picked up his voice as soon as Jim's diminished.   \"We gave you all the money you needed!\" yelled an older senator to the far right. \"And you.... you just go and decide to make it public?\"   It was clear that Jim was in quite a hairy situation. However, he held firm and shot back at them. \"Look, Senator White, it's no secret that we needed more funding to complete the project. I just did what I had to do.\"   \"But this, Jim. I mean, this is too far,\" replied the Ohio senator. Jim held back for a minute, then released his next thought. \"Look, it's not like this was going to remain a secret forever. We in the lab saw that the weather balloon thing wasn't going to net us much in profit, so we...\" Jim was then interrupted by the Ohio senator.   \"Goddammit Jim, fucking condoms?\" said the senator in a fit of rage. There were TV cameras there, no doubt capturing this moment. \"You took government funds. Funds that were clearly set aside to make higher rising weather balloons, and you decide to not only make a classified material public, you use it to make condoms?\"   Jim said, \"I'm sorry senator.\" He then leaned back in his chair. \"But you can't deny their effectiveness...\" he said, opening his palms out and shrugging his shoulders. He was interrupted by the Ohio senator again.   \"ENOUGH!\" he barked out, no doubt exacerbated by the circumstances.   There was a silence in the room after that. Nobody really knew how to follow it up. After all, having US government funds being used for condoms is not something one expects when they get elected to office.   Jim broke the silence after it had gone on for 20 seconds or so.   \"It appears this discussion has come to a head...\"",
  "A hole in time and space opens up, and you see your younger self looking back at you. You have exactly one minute to tell young-you whatever you can before the hole closes. Bonus points if you only give yourself one minute to type the response. Did that really happen?   I knew it was coming, I was prepared for years, yet I still was panicking and stumbled over my words. That portal started closing immediately after it opened.   Stocks, disasters and preventable wars. I had managed to fit that part of the message into a careful selection of words and ideas. I had unlimited power in my hands. I had a good 30 seconds left to fill it with any number of selfish and personal things I could have changed. My personal obligation to the world was done. About Vicky, how she tore our heart out. About Carlos, that backstabber. That summer with the red bike. I still have the scar.   And yet, I stood there and said nothing. I thought I could change it. But I froze. At least, that's what I remember. That older me standing there. Just looking. Trying to form words. Spouting gibberish.   That's what I remember. I thought I could change it. But then when the time came, I understood.   If I changed things maybe this glimpse wouldn't happen. Maybe I would be different. Maybe it everything that happens is meant to happen and there's nothing I can do about it. Maybe the only function of this event was to cherish the moment.   So there I stood, the same frozen statue that couldn't utter out a single comprehensive thing. I hope this young me didn't hate me like I hated the future me I saw the glimpse.   But I knew the truth. He does resent me. And only when he gets to my point in time will he understand.",
  "Saturday morning, March 24th 2015, 5 students report to Shermer High School for detention. I walked into detention, don't wan na be here but meh whatever.   Bored out of my mine I just thought about why I was there, sure showing up 20 minutes late is bad but damn detention for not setting an alarm?! atleast I got to school faculty   But, I just watch as the time tick by, and the other 4 classmates look bored out of their mind.   What are we to do? nothing besides read and nap.   I decided to get a paper out and drew a circle, over and over again. It's like walking in circles but for writing. Maybe this will pass the time.   I can't do homework, I already did it during lunch yesterday cause flippers doing homework at home.   soooooooo yeah   Around 20 minutes into the detention and everyone, including the teacher, is asleep besides me. maybe if I watch the clock it will go faster or something   Nope. nothing, still going by at normal speeds. I then begin to think about what I do after class   Nap? play video games? your judgement of fun is clouded in here.   I digress, and the time ticks by slowly and painfully   The end",
  "Write a journal entry for a child that has been abused (mentally, emotionally, physically, spiritually, sexually, etc) their entire life.... Dear Diary,   I slept well last night. \"Daddy\" didn't come back to the house until he was drunk enough to collapse on his *own* bed. At least one night of solace for me and the baby. That's what he makes me call him, anyways. Daddy. I don't remember my real father. He never came home from Iraq, so my mother told me. Probably why no one was watching me while I played outside that day, mother was at work.    Autumn must be just around the corner because it feels warmer down here, Daddy must have turned on the heat because of the colder weather. Sometimes I can remember what it was like. Autumn had vibrant colors, golden, red, and yellow hues painting the trees as the leaves were bled of life. I used to gaze out the window as I read John Green novels, wrapped in my blanket and sipping tea mother had prepared for me, enjoying the agony of the leaves as they resigned to beautiful decay.    I fell asleep early last night, or was it night? It might have been day, I don't know. I never know. Down here the only light I have is from this little bulb. Sometimes in the winter I touch it quickly to warm my hands. The pain is warming, it brings my fingers out of numbness. That is all I feel. Numbness. I probably look as I feel: a gaunt shadow, withered and sunken. There is nothing left. My only enjoyment comes from the quiet blackness that awaits in sleep, the silent oblivion. I didn't wake up in tremors last night. And even when I did wake up, there was a brief instant where I forgot who and where I was. I miss that feeling.    I hope they find me.",
  "The hero was killed, the princess was sacrificed, and the evil king rules the land. For the average citizen, though, things have taken a turn for the better. Mollu the Potter awoke early, as he always did, to greet the morning sun and thank the goddesses for another wonderful day. Taking care not to wake his wife, he got out of bed to put some wood in the kiln for another long day of pottery making. He gazed out at the pale orange dawn over Hyrule and reflected about how much had changed since the invasion.   Sure, the royal family had been slaughtered mercilessly, but the Gerudo had also driven out those wretched other creatures from the land. Now that the Gorons were gone, great mining projects had begun in Death Mountain, turning Hyrule into a centre of industry and trade. Great factories had been built to refine the coal and iron from the mines, allowing for the construction of powerful machines and more bountiful harvests. The Kokiri were driven from the forests, allowing a booming lumber and construction industry to rise. With the Zora having fled following the death of Jabu-Jabu, the rivers had been diverted to aqueducts and irrigation, allowing for such bountiful harvests that Mollu's two daughters had never known hunger in their lives.   *Ah yes, my family, * thought Mollu, placing a slab of clay on his potter's wheel and beginning to pump the foot pedal.   Certainly the best part of the Gerudo invasion had been the sudden infusion of beautiful women into the land. Sure, they were a bit more aggressive than the Hyrulean women, but Mollu loved his wife Siv with all his heart.   As he began to shape the wet clay into a pot, Mollu thought back to his early days as a potter, back when he was just an apprentice in his master's shop. He remembered the day *the boy* had arrived in the shop. Thinking it odd that someone so young should be interested in the fine art of pottery, Mollu had began to explain his wares to the lad.   It was then that the boy drew his sword.   Expecting a robbery or a murder, Mollu had shut his eyes in fear, but when he opened them, every pot in the store had been smashed and the boy was gone. Fearing his master's anger, Mollu quickly took pots out from the store room and replenished the storefront's supply. Right as he placed the final pot, he heard a faint jingle of the doorbell as the boy re-entered the shop. The boy drew his sword and the grizzly scene unfolded again.   Mollu tried enlisting the aid of the town guards, but none would heed his pleas. Mollu and his master easily lost three months' wages that day. Even with all the joys and blessings his life now had, he would never forget that day or that boy's voice....   *KYEAAAH!! *",
  "You have just been elected the president of the U.S only to learn that every President before you was actually a super villain, and always stopped by one man. The Prime Minister of Canada. \"He's been elected, Prime Minister\"   *Fuck, * I think. Not already. Our moose haven't recovered yet. The next NHL season is only two months away, so all of our best soldiers will be busy. *Fuck. * \"Fine. Round up the best of the best, they can afford to miss a day or two of training,\" I tell the young cadet next to me.   *The next day*   \"You guys got here quickly.\"   \"Well, it's an important cause. And like you said, we can all afford to miss a day,\" Crosby tells me. He's a good captain, both of his team and of the Canadian Presidential Unit (CPU, for short). What the CPU does, you see, is take down the president. Okay, not *literally* take down (though in some cases we did, okay, I admit it. JFK was assassinated by us, since he had a scheme in the works to take over the world), but to threaten the president (with death) and keep the CPU over his head the entire time.   Thank God Obama had a change of heart towards the end.   \"Anyways, sorry for this inconvenience, but I just want you guys to give him a scare. The new guy looks harmless enough.\" \"No problem, boss.\"   I give them a smile, shake Crosby's hand and send them on their way.   *In the president's office*   \"OH MY GOD, SIDNEY FRIGGIN' CROSBY!\"   *Sigh. * I think the Minister really overestimated this guy's threat level. Toews gives me a look that says \"it could be a facade, ya know.\" I do *know, * but this guy seems just unfit to function on a day-to-day basis, let alone as president. Oh well....   *Hours later*   \"CPU? So you guys are, like, soldiers, or something?\"   So these guys think I'm a threat? Why would think that? Did they already tell me?   \"FUC-yeah, yes, we're here because every president before you has been a *super villain, * if you can prove to us you're not, we'll leave and you won't hear from the CPU again,\" Crosby sounds exasperated. Toews is giving me dirty looks. Sharp just looks generally annoyed.   Sharp pulls Crosby close and whispers something into his ear.   \"How about an IQ test?\" Sharp suggests to me.   \"Sure.\"   *Back at the prime minister's office*   \"So he's basically retarded, is what you're saying?\"   \"Yup. We have no idea how he was elected.\"   \"Okay, well expect an easy four years boys.\"",
  "Write the letter that you always wanted to, but never did. Dear E,   I saw a picture of us the other day from the time we reconnected as more than friends. I wanted to get in touch with you, but you've deleted your Facebook and changed your email address. I tried looking for you online but I don't even know if you're still working where you were before. It's been several years; maybe you've left Austria.   My mind runs to memories, lapping at them like a puppy. It was only a conversation or two after that night that we realized that we'd been attracted to each other for years. I still have trouble believing it. You always seemed to have this way about you, with your fierce intelligence and strong sense of self. Me? I was always his little sister, and felt like I lived in the shadow of that title. I'm glad you saw me as more.  I have this one image of you from when we were kids, leaning over your guitar and tuning it to Blackbird. You were -and still are, I'm sure- so magnetic. You were so proud of the culture we shared. I loved that about you, and your incredible memory for history. Thinking about it now, that could've subconsciously pulled me to study it in college. If that's the case, I'd like to thank you for that too. You picked up so many things so rapidly and it made me want to achieve more for myself as well.   I wish that we'd been able to run off for a weekend like we'd talked about after reconnecting.  Still, I'm glad we had that one time together. It meant so much to me.... And feeling the culmination of the years was beyond anything I'd experienced. Despite it being only an hour or two that we could share, those moments have been imprinted in my memory since. Thank you. I know it was a fantasy fulfilled for both of us. I hope you know that those brief hours are still cherished.   I wish I could talk to you. Not knowing what's going on in your life makes me imagine all the things you could be doing these days. Having no idea how to reach you, I'm left to wonder. I hope whatever you're working on is making you happy. Your eyes are even more beautiful when you're smiling.   Fondly,",
  "Within a year of birth every parent receives a small gift or note from their 18yo child via time travel. You don't. 17 years, and 364 days had passed since David's birth. I grew extremely anxious and stressed more than I ever could. What could be more stressful than never receiving your child's 18th year letter?   David sat across the room. He was reading a Calvin and Hobbes comic. His father had left the day he was born, and I never knew why. But that never bothered David. The boy still adored going through his father's wares. Books, comics, video games, tools, DVDs, computers, clothes.... David studied his father more than anything in the world.   I softly cleared my voice.   \"Davy, sweetheart, do you want some tea?\"   David didn't look up from the comic. \"Sure thing momma. Can I have some green tea, with some milk and honey in it?\"   I always loved making tea for David. \"Sure thing Davy\".   I reached for the cabinet with the tea when suddenly there was a knock at the door.   \"Davy can you get that?\"   \"Yes momma.\" David ran to the door.   Odd. David never ran to the door. He opened the door.   \"Davy sweetheart, how much sugar did you want?\"   The wind scratched the door on it's way in.   \"Davy?\"   I walked toward the door. I heard the door swing gently as the breeze pushed it open. I looked outside.   Nothing. No car. No shoes. Just footprints from the grass. But they only pointed one way though, towards the porch.   I saw a letter on the porch. And on it was David's handwriting. I opened it up and there was a small note inside, a key, and a flare.   The letter read the following:   \"Dearest Momma.   Daddy came by and needed my help. I knew this day would come so I wrote this letter ahead of time. I'm sorry I won't be having tea with you right now momma. But you can come see us.   Head to Old Glimmer Road and get to that old shed with the lock. Open the lock with the key and head inside. Light the torch, with the door closed, and hold it in your right hand. Papa and I will be on the other side. Best of luck Momma. We'll be waiting for you there.\"",

He let his beard be ruffled by the Other's metallic forefingers.   \"You have served them for long enough, but this world needs new guidance now.

  "You are a professional pickpocket. You've just picked someones pocket only to discover that the thing you have stolen is truly horrifying. As a professional pickpocket I tend to not regret stealing. Even though it affects the ones you steal from, it's your way of getting around. Besides that the ones you steal from usually aren't the poorest either. You go after the rich ones. But there's that one time I did fully regret it. It was about 7 years ago....   It was a sunny midday. I was strolling around the streets of Paris, filled with shops and tourists, ready to be exploited. I didn't have much on me, just simply clothes and a coat. I was making my way downtown when I noticed an unsuspecting man on his phone, walking towards me. I bumped into him and did a little magic trick, mugging him wallet in the process. I made sure to get some distance before checking the wallet....   It had the usual cash and cards, but there was more. Something I that still scares me till this day. Inside of the wallet was a picture of a me walking through the bustling streets of Paris. I left Paris the next day, and I've had no intention of going back there since.",
  "When two people get married, their hearts are surgically exchanged. You just filed for divorce. It was all I could do to stay on my feet, gaping at my husband.  This was ludicrous- *how could he do this to me? * I had never fathomed the man I had married could be so... well, heartless.   Only six years ago we had exchanged our vows and our hearts. Literally. It is believed that love is only true if you are willing to entrust your heart to your partner; *your other half*.  It's not that we'd been unhappy... Simply disconnected. For the past few months it had become difficult to keep up a conversation with one another. Frightened, I had finally broken down into a puddle at my husband's cold side. I asked him what had happened, and what I could do to improve our situation. He simply explained to me that he had been thinking.  Tom had pointed out to me that we had fallen into a neutral stalemate. We weren't warring, but had somehow lost what held us together. Looking back, I came to agree, but I was scared. Would it be easier to continue living life, two people physically together but in all other ways alone? Or would it be our best hope to risk the break?   To divorce meant to unbind ourselves from our wedding vows.  To unbind ourselves from each others' hearts.   Another surgery of that magnitude was utterly terrifying. That kind of thing was meant to be experienced just once in life.  Then again, I had always done well under anesthesia.  Then again, Tom and I were barely thirty years old.  We were pretty healthy people.  We could do this.  But it had to be soon.  Aging and organ transplants have not exactly been known to get along all that well.   Tom had held my hand as we met with our attorney, amicably signing papers and rationing out our worldly goods.  Tom had held my hand, assuring me that everything would be okay, right up until I had already fallen asleep on my gurney.   And now Tom was sitting in front of me, his elbows resting on his knees, as I bring my parcel into the house for the last time, still wearing my hospital band.   He tells me that he had been a bit less cautious with his health than he had ever let on.  He tells me that seven months ago he was diagnosed with a malfunctioning heart.   And he smiles at me, as he tells me this fatigue is only going to worsen.  Quickly.  And he smiles at me, as the first tear slips silently down my face.",

Bonus points if you only give yourself one minute to type the response. I gazed with astonishment as time and space were torn asunder in the patch of reality just before me. Here I stood looking at it and yet there I stood also, on the other side but younger, much younger.   I couldn't know how long I would have before time and space would right themselves again. I looked at myself there. Such a youthful face, the world hadn't marked and weathered it yet. So much innocence in those eyes, they had yet to see any horrors and troubled times. So much to tell, good and bad but where to start? What to include?   This was a time to speak from the heart, not the head. I look my younger self in his bright, sharp blue eyes and spoke calmly, sincerely.  \"You have a strength deep inside you, you can tap into it when you need it and it'll get you through the hardest of times.... But more importantly than that, you must learn to let people in because they'll help you even when you fail yourself.\"   My younger self, shocked as he was by this whole situation, looked about to respond when with a mighty crackling roar time and space reformed into there correct order and the bridge between Then and Now closed once more.

  "You are a God who has been watching over the world not intervening or viewing it for many centuries. You come back to see millions of people suffering, in pain and hopeless. How would you handle the world and bring it to peace once more without revealing your presence to mankind? *sigh*   It's exhausting work, being the creator of worlds, creatures, and space/time itself. Some days are better than others. Just the other day, for example, I formed a reality who's inhabitants conquered space and time in mere minutes. They were dedicated to advancing their lifestyles by any means necessary. They worked together excellently, and understood that if they were to survive, they would need to keep learning and understanding, rather than just sit around when they are comfortable or give up when things get hard. I'm very proud of them. They understand what love truly means, and they made it the foundation of their lifestyle, just as I intended.   Yesterday I decided to create a new reality with similar traits to the one I created three days ago. The only difference being that I increased my margin of error. *on purpose*. Please, I don't make intentional mistakes. What I discovered however, astounded me. The inhabitants of this reality progressed forward at less than *HALF* the rate of the compared one. And it's obvious as to why. They lack the true understanding of Love. Because of this, I have witnessed them wage wars of mass destruction, slaughter millions of their own... even billions eventually....  They are obsessed with self fulfillment, and ever since the 5th hour after creation, have lost the understanding of survival. A majority of the inhabitants would rather lay around and do nothing than extend their help towards those who are dying due to lack of food, water, basic medical treatment, and so on. Their advancements in technology and travel are sub par. Mediocre at best. I truly worry about them.   It shouldn't go unsaid that I *HAVE* tried to help them in the most subtle ways possible. I have created exact replicas of some of the greatest inhabitants from the previous reality, and fit them in at different points along the this realities timeline. In theory, these creations would be able to teach the rest of the inhabitants what it means to truly Love. I even directly communicated with some of these creations, telling them what they need to say.   And still, this twisted reality continues to ignore the truth. MY truth. I guess the margin of error was just too high. It created too many selfish and foolish beings.   I will wait and see though. Because it doesn't go without saying that this reality isn't without surprises. Maybe in a couple days I will come back and check on them. Until then, I will leave them to figure things out, to wonder, to experiment, and hopefully after they have exhausted all recourses, they can finally turn to the one thing that matters for help... Love.",
  "Our protagonist has just been gifted with a divine vision: precisely one year from now, if there are fewer than 100,000 people still keeping their butter in the refrigerator, all humanity will be saved. Otherwise, all humanity shall suddenly and violently perish. Sometimes, to save the world, you have to break a few eggs. Or in this case, drive to extinction a species we'd domesticated for thousands of years.

  "You are clumsy in the kitchen. Today, you perform a satanic ritual entirely by accident. If I were a smarter person, I would have just ordered from Lucky Wong's # 7 for the fourth time that week. But I had watched Julie and Julia again and felt inspired. I could cook my way through Gwyneth Paltrow's new cookbook, steam my vagina, and become just like the great GOOPy one.   I tied my retro floral apron around my waist and began surveying my Whole Foods haul. There were a lot of ingredients that I'd never cooked with before, but if Gwyneth says that I need Star Anise and Moon Dust to make a sea urchin risotto, then that's what I'm going to do.   I methodically added herbs to the stock, which means that only 8 of the 11 herbs got a double dose, before stirring the fair trade-organic-non-gmo arborio rice that was picked by female entrepenuers who are making a livable wage in the third world.   I tried to silence the voice in my head that told me I'd spent a month's rent on three bags of groceries as I began chopping the raddichio that was picked under the light of a full moon to provide additional flavonoids and anti-oxidents. The clerk had beamed when telling me about the bowel movement I would have after eating the salad prescribed by page 8 of the book.   I ended up cutting my hand and bleeding all over the raddichio and artisinal baby greens farmed by Nobel Laureates on sabbatical, but decided that a quick rinse would be okay. After all, vegetables grow in dirt. These vegetables happened to have grown in dirt that was blessed by monks committed to the cause of gender equality, but it's all the same.   I moved to stir the risotto, but my hand bled into the pan. As I jerked to prevent any further ruining of the now clumpy risotto that was charred in one section, I bumped the pan and set my apron strings on fire. I tried to douse the flames with the vinaigrette that boasted vinegar distilled by virgins who live in the nunnery in the Alps, but I only proceeded in making a bigger mess. I finally remembered to stop, drop, and roll.   \"I'm alive.\" I croaked as I lay on the kitchen floor staring at the ceiling. \"What the fuck was I thinking?\"   \"You've definitely burned this,\" declared a voice above me. She was standing there in the flesh with her hands on her hips. A bemused expression crossed her too-perfect features. I wanted to ask her so many questions, but I was dumbstruck. \"Now, more to the point. Why have you summoned me?\"   Gwyneth Paltrow was in my kitchen.",
  "In the future, technology has allowed us to have pillows that monitor our brain waves, and when people wake up they can plug them into their laptops and watch their dreams. Hello YouTube, welcome to this week's episode of Making Movies On A Budget.   I'm here in the studio with my mate Ralph and --   *Well, the studio is actually my mom's living, the usual studio is getting fumigated. *   Right, yes, we're here in Ralph's mom's living room, and this week we are going to tackle the issue of backgrounds.   So if you're a regular of our show, you already know the basics for a dynamic scene, but there is more to it than just the action and dialog. Ralph?   *That's right, the wrong setup can kill your scene faster than anything. Fortunately the solution is easy-peasy. You just dream it up! *   So for this you will only need your trusty video editor, an expert imaging sistem and a pillow.   Now, you want to load up your dream from the pillow into the editor --   *We already have this thing set up with an older dream on mine, you will recognize it from last week's episode. *   -- And just let the imaging system figure out what's what. You may need to specify some details, like if that building is a church or a bank --   *A church in real life, of course, but in this case it will be the library where next week's fight scene will take place. *   Haha, spoilers! Anyway, once the system is done, you get a fully imersive environment, and just set the points of interest and actors.   *Now, using the camera tool, set the motion path, I put in just a point for a static point of view, and adjusting the focal length -- *   Wait, no, can we get some cloud cover?   *Too bright? *   No, the tower on the right looks better against the clouds.   *Ok, hold on.... Better? *   Perfect! So now we just hit Render, and lo and behold, the fabled city of Paris, as it probably looked back when.   *That's it for today's episode, be sure to like and subscribe, and we'll see you next week.... *   .... On Making Movies On A Budget!   * * *   Because we've all seen those video tutorials that amount to \"you press this button then you press this button and you're done, like and subscribe\"",
  "[ CW ] In five sentences, tell a horror story. Her hands were cold and stiff, like the meat in the cooler at the supermarket. This was unsurprising because it was winter; we had been trapped in the car for far too long and she had been dead for some time now. It seemed to be warming up a bit now and I could feel the warmth seeping back into my hands. As I lay back in my reclined seat enjoying the small bit of warmth I heard a subtle movement and felt her grab my hand. I suddenly opened my eyes and turning toward her saw her with her now pale blue skin, grinning at me, and all I could hear now was the sound of my scream.",
  "Every single day the world votes to kill off one person. Whoever receives the most votes that day is killed. It was the last invention of mankind. Societal collapse began after a week. The hopes, the dreams, the wishes - whatever had accompanied the creation - shattered after it was leaked onto the internet. Suddenly it wasn't a select group of people choosing the deaths, a jury of executioners, it was the entire world. At 12:00pm EST, a single person in the world would drop dead from no discernible cause.  The technology behind it was complex, a new order of probability theory made reality.   Tyrants and terrorists were the first to go. The hope remained even among the growing horror that maybe, just maybe, the world would show its good side. Its collective benevolence. But on the fourth day, the same day god created the evening and the morning, on the fourth day an outspoken celebrity, famous for her acting and pouting, was killed.   And so the floodgates were opened. On the fifth day, the president of the united states of america fell to the machine. The sixth? An Indian left wing political blogger. Weeks passed and social media was abandoned as popularity suddenly became deadly. Actors and diplomats alike fell to the vote, instagram stars and royalty. Simply having a name could be fatal if anybody else knew it.   They tried to shut it off, but it had spread too far and too fast, and as governments fell one by one, the dystopian future that so many books and films promised became a reality.   After two years and nearly 700 deaths, America had fallen. India had fallen. France, England, China. The great nations of the world all fell.  Eventually the world ran out of famous people. A cynical commenter might have quipped about it being worth it thanks to the loss of the Kardashians, but the reality was bleak and grim.   Eventually, ten votes was enough to get a person killed, as everyone was left to vote for people they knew, people who had irritated them. Even picking a name at random ran with the risk that Joe Smith had annoyed his three neighbours that day, and your random vote tipped the scale.   People lost their names. It didn't work with nicknames or pseudonyms, so it wasn't uncommon for the girl you met while trying to catch a rabbit to avoid starvation to introduce herself as Rabbit.   It added an oddly bright side to a ruined world.",
  "[ CW ] In five sentences, tell a horror story. That morning, I reached work after a long struggle with rush hour traffic. I walked the maze of artificially lit rooms to my cubicle with its tall grey walls, and spent the day doing busy work for a project that would be cancelled because it wasn't profitable. During my return commute, there was an accident half a mile ahead, so we didn't move for an hour, but I didn't mind that- it was something different. I reached home at seven, had a frozen dinner and watched TV til I fell asleep on the couch.   The next morning, I reached work after a long struggle with rush hour traffic.",
  "A device is released that allows a person to dive into a book and experience its contents firsthand. The manual mentions a certain book you shouldn't go in, for no one has ever returned from copies of it, but you decide to ignore the manual and go in anyway. *Oh. That's why. *   Memories quickly fade and I'm floating in an infinite expanse of white, with no clear idea of which way is up or down. Everything is weightless, and I have no sense of motion or position in the endless void.   Numbers and letters suddenly materialize in view, detailing specs and measurements of the VisionCorp Reader I vaguely remember purchasing. Where was I? How did I get here?   I crane my head upwards (or, at least, what I assume to be upwards) and can see giant, black letters:   **VisionCorp Reader Owner's Manual**   As I float among the various text boxes and diagrams, I notice a section titled *warnings*. Suddenly, I'm not alone in this blank void; I see other people.   A window has appeared, and in this square frame I see a man in his bathroom. He's lounging in his bathtub holding a small metal device. He touches it to his book and suddenly passes out, falling into the tub's water. A large, red X appears over the window, and it fades out of existence.   Suddenly, I see another window, this one containing a man driving. He touches a similar metal object to a book in the passenger seat, and passes out immediately. Similarly, a red X appears over his window.   Yet another square materializes, and in this one, I see a child of no more than four years holding the device. She touches it to a children's book and a red X immediately appears. Strange.   Suddenly, a number of exclamation marks appear, demonstrating that this window is of importance. The square appears, and within it is a man in everyday clothes holding the metal device. In his other hand, he holds a small pamphlet reading **VisionCorp Reader Owner's Manual. ** *Odd, * I think, *why would that be dangerous? *   The man touches the device to the manual and suddenly my white reality surges. The window begins to expand at an alarming rate as a horrible suction pulls me into the window, and suddenly I'm in an endless white void.   *Oh, that's why, * I think, as my memories begin to fade.

  "What if ghosts are, in reality, glimpses of time travelers? **September 26, 1983**   Lieutenant Colonel Petrov sat at his duty station, rubbing his tired eyes. As an officer of the Soviet Air Defense Forces, he was used to long watches. He might have thought he was dreaming when the air around him shimmered, and the visitor appeared before him. She was dressed in what appeared to be casual attire of a fashion Petrov was unfamiliar with. Her long black hair was bound behind her head in a pony tail. She was beautiful.   \"Who are you?\" he began. \"How did you get in here?\"   \"Who I am is unimportant.\" replied the visitor. \"What I have come to ask you is of the utmost importance, however.\"   \"Are you a ghost?\" he asked in wonder.   \"I am a traveler.\" she smiled. \"That is all you need to know. I have come to you today because I want you to pause and ask yourself a very simple question.\"   \"What is the question?\" he asked.   \"Do you believe that *anyone* truly wants our world to end?\" she asked him evenly.   Petrov thought about this in regards to his work. Why would this vision appear to him? Was something about to happen? He again rubbed his eyes and looked for his wondrous visitor. She was gone.   The alarm sounded. The computers had detected an American first strike. Nuclear missiles were now heading towards the Soviet Union. It was now required that they launch in retaliation for this atrocity, mutually assured destruction was guaranteed. It was truly the end of the world.   *Or was it? *   \"Not on my watch.\" Petrov said aloud.",
  "[ TT ] You work on the assembly line in a cybernetic implant factory. You and your coworkers like to prank each other by shoving defective components into each others bodies. \"Goddamit Ryan,\" Jerry said.   He fished his finger out of his cup of tea, along with the now soggy bourbon. His index finger had felt a little off all day. Technically his index finger had come off a long time ago, back when health and safety meant not sticking your dangly bits between metal jaws.   Ryan for his part found it hilarious. The others in the room just shook their head. Ryan had at one time or another pranked all of them.   \"You got ta stop sleeping at work,\" he said between breaths. \"You're just too easy man.\"   \"Next time I'll.... next time,\" Jerry muttered as he left the break room, taking half the pack of biscuits with him.   -- -   The loos were Ryan's alone time. Just him, the latest page 3, and a long break from the assembly line. It wasn't real, but it was the thought that counts. He heard the door to the bathroom swing open and cursed. Then the door opened again. More footsteps.   \"You all eat Matt's wifes leftover stew?\" Ryan joked to the back of the toilet door.   Shuffling. Toilet seats hitting bowls. What were they doing? \"Now,\" a voice said. Two pairs of arms reached over the top of the low plywood wall, grabbing Ryan before he could stand.   The door burst open and Ryan found himself caught with his pants down. Literally.   \"Eenine, meenie, miny, mo,\" Jerry said, tapping on the collar around Ryan's neck. With a gurgle, the seal came apart and Jerry carefully lifted Ryan's head from his cybernetic body.   \"Put me the fuck down,\" Ryan shouted. Or at least tried. Without a windpipe, he was on emergency blood-oxygenation from the collar's reserves.   The bag was stifling, bounced around like a sack of potatoes, but Ryan refused to give in. Until he was reseated again and took stock of his new body.   \"Ha ha. Very funny,\" he said. \"Now give me back my rig.\"   \"Yeah, about that,\" Jerry said. \"We put it in a taxi back to it's home address. You really should have updated your registration when you moved out of your parents.\"   \"Hell no,\" Ryan said.   \"Oh yeah,\" Jerry and everyone else said.   Ryan looked down at the breasts peeking out from beneath the thin coveralls and swore he'd get them all back for this.",
  "Write a better ending to the \"Russian Sleep Experiment\" Creepypasta. The subject smiled.   Suddenly, the surviving researcher could feel a bright, warm light spreading throughout his body. He let go of the gun in shock, bringing his hands to his chest. He could feel the indescribably powerful force cascading through his essence, wiping out all traces of the fear which only seconds ago had driven him to the point of insanity.   Love.   He knew the emotion when he felt it, but had never known it in a form that was this strong, this insatiably pure. His eyes flitted back towards the man, who still wore his cardboard smile. He could see through the smile like a window into the deprived mind lying just behind the clenched teeth. What he saw was not madness, but the greatest sense of peace and calm he had ever known.   \"How? Why?\" He remembered the earlier observations, the way that the prisoners so wantonly destroyed eachother and themselves.   \"It'll all be ogre soon.\" The subject dropped his smile, yet the raw sensation of nearly orgasmic bliss remained. The researcher slumped against the cell, barely aware of the dozens of preening eyes that carefully observed his every move. \"Better check yourself before you shrek yourself\". It was then that the researcher noticed that the prisoner wasn't moving his lips as he spoke, nor was the sound originating from him. He looked over, but only caught a glimpse of the hulking figure lurking on the other side of the room before his vision went black.   All the former sensations of bliss and beauty were banished into some forsaken realm from which they were not soon to return. They were destined to be replaced by the agony which was to follow the researcher's blindness; a sensation even stronger than the love which had enraptured his mind only seconds ago.   The voice spoke again: \"Bend ovah donkeh.\" It was impossibly charismatic, as if the mere nature of its inflection was sufficient to entirely control a person.   Before he could act on the voice's prompt, the researcher felt himself falling down into a vast and mysterious unknown. Nothing but a cold and inky blackness met his sight as he struggled to discover his location.   All of a sudden, he heard the unmistakable sound of knuckles cracking. \"This is my swamp.\" After that, there was only pain.",
  "A collective consciousness that can not take control of people's bodies by force. It must persuade people to join willingly. The hivemind swept across the globe with relative ease. It wasn't a regular hivemind, mind. You had to *want* to join it before it took you into its fold.    Those under it maintained *some* level of autonomy, but largely they were directly controlled by the wireless connections that meshed them together. It was a thing born of the internet, that quickly grew and expanded, creating new technologies until those who had opted in to it became linked, shared thoughts and feelings more so than any previous trial before. The birth of the hivemind.    Public opinion was mixed, largely due to the people that had chosen to meld themselves. A wide array of misfits, people who were largely rejected by society. The weeaboos, the neckbeards, the furries, bronies, militant atheists, you name it. Not all of those chose to meld, and some outright rejected it, claiming it to be insidious and a “ shithole ”, but for the most part, it was a form of escapism they could get only by outsourcing thought, as it were.    Once meshed and melded, the hivemind grew to accommodate them, the overall thoughts and ethos of it weighting ever more slightly. The end result was a ‘ Tyranny of the Majority ”, where the foremost groups were represented foremost in the hivemind's overall being, its self. There was some disparity between certain parts, like it wasn't fully in agreement with itself. Cognitive dissonance that often caused many users to disconnect themselves – there was nothing to stop them, after all.    All you had to do was register, it was as simple as that.    I decided one day that I would join. It was a spur of the moment thing. My parents were adamant that I shouldn't, it was tantamount to killing yourself. Not really, I reasoned, because I'm still being represented by it.    You simply went to a website and created an account, accepting the terms and conditions, which I did.    Just like that, I had a Reddit account.",

  "[ IP ] Boreal. The man stood on the prow of the boat, as the northern winds whipped against his face. The old boatman shivered, he had ferried travelers, merchants and adventures alike across this lake for years now, but he had never seen one quite like this before. The man was tall and broad of shoulder, made larger by the myriad of furs wrapped about his body to stave off the chills of the winter winds. His hair was a long and unkempt snarl of brown that looked at home among the thick pelts that surrounded his neck. Such features were not strange to the boatman though. You see plenty of large hairy men in the northern provinces as the north did not cater well to any other type. No, what was strange to the boatman was the manner of the man before him.   The boatman had done his job for so long the cold was naught but a nuisance to him on most days. The ever blowing wind that cuts straight to the bone of most men was a friend of his now. Most storms he could weather with a smile on his face and a song upon his cracked lips, but this night was different. Tonight was a chill so bitter that it seemed as though the God of Winter was wrapping the world in his embrace, and the closer they came to the frosty palace before him the colder it seemed to get. Yet the man before him never once shivered, never once broke his gaze from the palace ahead. If the boatman hadn't seen the slight rise and fall of his breathing, he would've assumed to man to be dead and frozen stiff. *He must have a soul like a furnace to keep him warm in this chill, * the boatman mused as he steadily stroked the icy black water, bringing them ever closer to the town of Farrowind, and the palace of it's king.   The man had heard stories of this town, heard many a tale of the tyrant who came to this land long ago to subjugate its people. The king was fabled to wield the power of winter itself, and could conjure frost and ice at a whim. Some stories said he was a demon of ice in human form, still others said that the ruler of Farrowind was the God of Winter himself, come to walk the earth and fulfill his promise of the winter without end. The man however, knew better. *It has to be him* the man thought to himself. After countless dead ends and petty mages, this had to be the real thing. The man broke his gaze to look down at his palm. A small flame flickered to life above his hand, dancing hypnotically in the wind. He curled his hand into a fist snuffing the flame and looked back towards the palace. *I'm coming for you brother, and this time you will not deserve my mercy. *",
  "Stuck on a small island surrounded by eerie mist, you quickly discover the only thing that is keeping you safe is the bright revolving lights coming from the lighthouse. We had rented kayaks for the day. Paul had done it the summer before with a friend and I was depending on his expertise. The plan was to head out to a small touristy island, spend the day exploring, maybe find a place that sold gelato or saltwater taffy then head back before dark. But the kayak part was taking longer and we were only now getting close to the island and it was already pretty late, My arms ached from the work out and Paul and I had gotten too far away. I'd seen him land pretty far down the island. I tried to head closer to him but the current had pulled me steadily further away from him. I couldn't even see him anymore as the sun had set and only the faint remains of the sunset were visible. I pulled into the abandoned looking beach. The tourist side must be on the other side. This part looked pretty abandoned. There was even a chewed up looking deer carcas on the beach. There was chilly fog that blew through obscuring things. At first I thought that it was my imagination but as I walked up the beach I realized that I was being followed. There were strange small two legged creatures that reached up to my thigh or so. They chattered to each other in a series of high pitched chirps and clicks, seemingly calling each other towards a chase. Several more appeared and seemed to be closing in on me. They had large luminous eyes, razor sharp teeth, and long thin tongs that flicked over their teeth and lips as they closed in. I tried to keep a slow pace, thinking if I ran, it would just be more dangerous. A beacon-like light hit and the creatures gasped and sputtered drawing back away from the light. I could just make out on the hill ahead of me a lighthouse. The rotating lights from it seemed to repel the creatures. I made towards twit trying not to break out into a run. I did not have much stuff on me. I had a small waterproof bag containing a wallet, my cell phone (sadly dead batteries), and a small thing of mace. I gripped the mace in my right hand and worked to stay towards the light. The things were still tailing me but we're keeping a distance from the light. I called out for Paul and kept going towards the lighthouse.",

I did my best to block out the sounds coming from the adjoining kitchen, and read:   \"Acute radiation syndrome (ARS), also known as radiation poisoning, radiation sickness or radiation toxicity, is a constellation of health effects which present within 24 hours of exposure to high amounts of ionizing radiation. The radiation causes cellular degradation due to damage to DNA and other key molecular structures within the cells in various tissues; this destruction, particularly as it affects ability of cells to divide normally, in turn causes the symptoms. The symptoms can begin within one or two hours and may last for several months.\"   *Fuck, * I thought. I flicked my thumb upwards on the screen (*how the fuck was that so painful? *) and read some more, my eyes barely able to focus, the pulsing of my blood a source of tangible pain in every inch of my body.   ``.... nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and abdominal pain are usually seen within two hours. Vomiting in this time-frame is a marker for whole body exposures that are in the fatal range above 4 Gy. Without exotic treatment such as bone marrow transplant, death with this dose is common.... Neurovascular syndrome typically occurs at absorbed doses greater than 30 Gy (3000 rad), though it may occur at 10 Gy (1000 rad). It presents with neurological symptoms such as dizziness, headache, or decreased level of consciousness, occurring within minutes to a few hours, and with an absence of vomiting. It is invariably fatal.\"   *Fuck you, Jimmy Wales, * I thought, and weakly threw the phone across the room. It didn't go far, and tumbled with a soft thump on the carpet.   My cheek felt like it was on fire after having been pressed into the carpet for so long. I lifted my head as much as I could and saw that I'd been drooling blood. There was a dark puddle in the carpet. My mouth felt sticky, but I couldn't move my tongue enough to tell if I'd accidentally chewed through my cheek, or just vomited up blood again.   The retching started in the kitchen again, along with a wet splattering sound, like someone pouring soup onto the ground. I listened as long as it went on - it wasn't like I could do much else - and then listened some more as the heaving, pain-riddled sobs resumed where the vomiting left off.   *Invariably fatal, * I thought. *That's not so bad. * I shut my eyes, the lids seeming to rub against my corneas like sandpaper, and did my best to go to sleep, hoping against hope that I wouldn't wake up again.",

  "To keep up with challenges by mortals, Death must master every new game that comes up. But there's one game that he just can't figure out for the death of him. Jump forward aerial. Down smash special. B B A Up Down A. He had memorized these combonations for days. He had found strategies like no others. But every match, that floating silver ball got away. The King of the Graveyard had practiced this game for years. He always won his challenges. Joust, Duck Hunt, Checkers. No one had ever beaten him. And then Eric came along. This man brought a new game that Death had never played.   Death had been playing this Eric for centuries. Every game turned out the same. Eric unleashed his Final Attack, and the Starstorm overwhelmed the monkey that Death had learned to so cleverly use. Death did not understand how that silver ball would always fly away from him. Alas, this challenge would never be won.   This challenged proceed for hundreds and thousands of years. Earth was gone, Christ had battled his nemesis for 7 years, all that good stuff.

  "\"He was never warm in his entire life. Not once.\" Everything around him was warm, soothing, comfortable. Everything he needed was brought to him at will. It was good.   However, one day he started to notice that the walls seemed to be slowly closing in around him. At first he thought is was all in his mind, but as the days went on his world felt smaller. The food was still there, the warmth, but the freedom he'd enjoyed began to be restricted, slowly suffocating his movements.   Soon after that discovery, when he though there could be no more room left, a terrible rumble sounded around him. It was the loudest thing he'd ever heard and it started to build. Louder. More often. Louder, more often.   And that's when the shaking started. He was thrown around, somehow turned this way and that as he felt the walls truly start to compress against him.   He had no control, the world was shifting around him, and he felt only the sense falling. He tried to scream, but this voice failed him. Terror gripped his heart, would this be the end, he wondered as his world shook and closed in around him. Is this my end?   Suddenly, a blast of cold hit him causing him to wince against the sensation. The pressure building near his head and the cold below and he felt the darkness creep into him.   He felt like he might be drowning when suddenly a massive hand appeared and grabbed him. Maybe he would be saved after all!   However, even with his rescuer's help, the pressure continued to build as the cold slowly encased his body. Screaming was all he had left before the final moment of peace took him.   The last words he heard were: \"We're not going to lose him! Call ^the ^^neonatal ^^^ICU ^^^^right ^^^^^NOW!\"   He never heard his name or felt the sun on his face.

  "Jesus returns, to a world populated entirely by robots. The trumpets sounded. The seals were broken. The scrolls were read and the cups were poured. New Jerusalem descended from the clouds and the one hundred and forty-four thousand were chosen.... but no one showed up.   The wind whispered in the empty streets. The golden roads were empty. The crowns were untouched and the songs of praise were unsung. Christ the Lord, Redeemer and Savior, looked upon his children.... and Jesus wept.   Servers. Fields of servers. Square miles of servers. Continents full of servers. The entire world was connected to itself and connected to nothing. Heaven and Hell had passed away and a new sense of paradise and corruption had taken their place. All the fanfare was for naught because there were no eyes left to see it and no hands left to tremble at the awe of the Lord's second coming.   They were still there, of course. His flock had not wandered. They had looked to the stars at one time, found them cold and unreachable, and turned to another way. Why should they risk their lives and souls in a fool's errand to other worlds when it was so easy to create whatever they wanted? Monitors became virtual reality goggles. Those turned into direct feeds from computer to brain. After that, they uploaded their consciousness to computers. Finally, they transferred their consciousness permanently, living (so to speak) their entire lives inside their computers as digital representations of their former selves. The bodies died and decayed but the mind, the soul (so to speak) lived on. Mechanical custodians had been created to tend the servers and they were the only moving things across the barren wastes of the New Kingdom.   Inside the servers, life went on. Children were coded, houses built line by line. The weather was controlled with a thought and anything imaginable was attainable. Heaven had come down early and it was better than anyone - even God Himself - could create, for each Heaven, each Hell (if that was your flavor of the week), was exactly what the individual wanted. Nothing more and nothing less.   Jesus had returned in all his glory and magnificence.... only to find he was several thousand software updates too late.",

Nothing physically different about him, so then his powers let him blend into society.   \"Logan.... or do you prefer James?\" Wolverine clenched his teeth, the familiar SNIKT accompanying the set of forearm length silver claws. It was immediate that the blue-furred Beast stepped in and put up one of his big palms.   \"Logan, calm down, our new friend must be a telepath.\" Beast explained as the man shook his head.   \"Actually, I'm Jesus.\" Logan snarled to the man's words, then tossed the finished cigar onto the sidewalk and put it out with his boot.   \"And I'm Wolverine, what's yer point?\"   \"Jesus...?\" The brown-haired girl blinked. His appearance, name, there was no way he was actually. \"Jesus....

  "The most hateful, spiteful, bitter confession of undying love. Mind if I take a different approach? It's infatuation but also hate: hate because he never loved her.   I'm hanging from the walls, trailing onto the floor, swimming in smoke. The room is filled with his breath and hers, it hits me hard and bitter and rusts my eyes. He's kissing her in the drunken sweat, a smile dripping from his lips, a fag still in his fingers. And I'm watching.   Nothing ever came of me, when he left. When he spat on my body and stomped on my skin with crow black, slick shoes. His spiked tongue ravished me and then I was nothing.   She laughs inwardly, her hair of wires collapse in front of her face. Her sweet little spice: speckled with gold freckles and embroidered with green eyes. Fuck you.   He drapes his hands on her waist and my head lolls. Their fingers grip harder onto each other as the air gets heavier, until I'm drunk, until I'm blind, until I'm crumbling. Stop. And then I'm tearing at my skin, I'm trembling and sweating.   \"I hate you.\" I whisper through my breath. Then he's over me and he's hitting me and she's laughing. She's laughing.

And nothing to sit on to watch it anyway.   I yawn and stretch. I can't even be bothered to bang on the door again. That got tiring after the first five minutes.   I sit and stare at the mirror. It's steely grey and offers back a shitty reflection. I know it's a two-way mirror. The only question is, who's on the other side. Or what.   \"What\" is more likely.

  "You were the last human on earth after the zombie apocalypse destroyed civilization. One day, you finally get infected by a zombie, but after turning, you realize what you've been missing out on. I grew up in fear. Honestly, it's amazing I lived as long as I did, as our numbers dwindled more and more, every year, to their endless numbers. They weren't just a force, they *hunted*, they consumed, they *thought* and fought us, every moment, of every day. The only thing that kept us alive was their tendency to rip their victims apart, before they could be turned.   Of course, now I understand.   Only the weak couldn't escape. From the *moment* you're bitten, it hits you, like a bucket of ice-cold water, it hits you, fills you with fear and adrenaline. If you can't get away for half an hour for it to happen with that in your system, then you're not worthy of surviving, you're just more food. You're not capable of this.   I *get* it, now. When I got infected, I was the last. Nobody is left in this part of the world, as far as I know. And now, I see why they did everything. Those of us who are clever, are fighters, who can be *hunters*, we're the only ones who survived being bitten, or survived attacking the remaining humans. Natural selection at it's finest. Of course, some of us they chose, like me. I asked the one who got me, the same day, once I understood I had nothing to fear. He could have followed me, hunted me down and kept trying, but he understood. I'd proven myself getting as far as I did. \"You had the instinct and the ability, all you needed was to be *one* of us.\"   My heartbeat is gone, my lungs quiet and dead. My skin is cool to the touch, though it is intact, solid, like that of all the others' I've seen. And yet, for all those things I lack, I've never felt more *alive* than now. Now, I understand. I'm a *predator*. I am a *Hunter*.   What I hunt doesn't even matter- so long as I can sink my fangs into its flesh, rip it limb from limb with my claws, stalk it in silence as it walks, unaweare, and fill myself with its meat, its flesh its blood. *This* is all I've required.

It was all he could do; They had tried to flee before, *she* had caught up and now Boots was tongueless.  The screams had turned to gurgles and the rattles of last breaths.

  "You discover that Earth is the \"North Korea\" of the galaxy \"Are they ready to go live?\" Zuko asked.   \"Yup, in just a minute,\" Tomi replied as he leaned back in his reclining chair.   This was a moment that the entire galaxy would see. After 10 years of avoiding all sorts of sensors and detectors, NICE news was finally getting a Live Leak into Earth.   The monitor screen flickered on: *And now for our prime time feature. Never before seen footage of the blue marble we call Earth. NICE news has just landed a camera crew on the ground and they will feed us a video stream for the next couple of weeks. Let's take you to the ground with Lazar Tigin. *   The screen turned white as the camera was adjusting for the sun's rays. Lazar Tigin appeared on the screen of billions as he adjusted his headset in front of a massive city.   Tigin whispered, \"I'm here in Southern New Jersey where you can get a glimpse of Earth's most spectacular city, New York City. We arrived a few days ago and have been stealthily moving toward this city. The smell on this planet is amazing out here in the forest. However, the industrial zones are horrific. I doubt we can get much closer to the City without being spotted. We are going to try and maneuver our way down the coastline to sunny Florida.\"   As soon as Tigin finished his sentence, a strange aerial vehicle with four wings approached. It was loud and caused a wind uproar. The cameraman lost hold of the device and it crashed to the ground. The footage was still playing as men rappelled from the helicopter. The last thing the camera played back was an image of a man pointing a weapon at the camera.",

  "A story of how I got my username. It is an old Indian belief that names are luck. However randomly, however unknowingly we name anything the name is blessed sometimes with luck that makes prosperity fall to its feet but sometimes bears curse that prevails until the named is destroyed, until the name is never called upon again, till the end of eternity.  Such was a friend I once knew, he had no name, no luck to bring joy no curse to induce pain. He was pale like a fallen leaf, living his life in complete simplicity. No-one knew his name they just used sign to call him. He neither spoke to anyone nor smiled a fake smile of courtesy but no-one complained because he did not hurt anyone until one dark evening when a Nightingale sat by his window on the bough of the tree just outside of his room and sung the gloomiest song this world has ever heard, in such a beautiful voice that to the far end of the street everyone looked out of their window to just have a glance of the magical bird that filled the village with the golden voice.  But my friend closed the window, trying to not to listen to the bird, he opened reddit and kept his username MrGoldenVoice that would bless him with luck he never dreamed before.",

How he had ended up in this backwater town escaped him, but he vaguely remembered his friend Matt mentioning it on the phone, the day after his sixteenth. None of this mattered though, because right now he was starving, and his waitress was impatiently awaiting his order.   \"Huh? Oh, I'll just have a coffee. \"  \"Alright, that'll be out in a sec.\"   2 minutes later, the waitress came back. As he was approaching the table, she stumbled, tossing coffee and creamer all over the carpet.   \"Shit,\" she muttered ``, how in the hell did that happen?\"   \"If you had tied your shoes, that wouldn't have happened.\" He said in a deep, manly voice, before shoving his hand over his mouth.   \"Huh?\" The waitress asked.   \"Oh, noth-\" his voice dropped again. \"I said, you should have tied your shoes.\" He blushes a bright red. \"I'm so sorry, I just can't control my sel-\" Again, his voice lowered to superman-like levels. \"Also, you should have invested in better shoelaces.

  "Another addiction becomes as socially acceptable as smoking is today. The doors slid open as Felix approached. He yawned and moved into the building to start his day (a Monday no less - yeck!). Making his way to the life, he found his desk mate Charlie grinning and holding the doors open for him. He was far too awake, as always.   \"Ah Felix, you poor bastard,\" he replied to Felix's grunt. \"Want a hit?\"   A hand materialised in front of his face as Charlie proffered an absurdly yellow Teardrip. The absurd brightness of the bottle woke him up enough to respond.   \"Uhh, no thanks Charlie. I don't drip.\"   Charlie laughed and flourished the little bottle as they walked out onto their floor. \"You're missing out buddy. Great way to start the day. I use this drip every morning. Two little plips and you're zeroed in on the rest of the day. Like a cheetah. Ready to hunt. Ready to get the buckaroos. Good. Stuff! And, look at my bottle! So bright! Neat huh? It's very'summery'.\" The bottle waggled about at eye level.   They reached their screens and the day began. For some faster than others. You could tell who dripped and who still tried to shake their circadian rhythms the good ol' fashioned way - coffee, sugar and wrenching yawns. Felix didn't understand it, but it was everywhere now. Only 50 years ago smoking had been the'in' thing. That started dying out around the same time as light drugs were being legalised. But since smoking wasn't cool anymore, Teardrips were born. Chemical concoctions that you dripped into your eyes. It started out harmless enough, a simple energiser mix which helped people to focus their tired eyes. From there... it kind of exploded.   Teardrips started to evolve for every social stratum. For the younger generation, drips offered to change eye color temporarily, or generate small reactions behind your irises which would shift and generate patterns. Some acted like mood rings (which made for a particularly intimidating meeting with his boss last week as her eyes had rippled a very, very, very deep black). Last week, during a nice dinner out, his wife had gazed at him as a particularly expensive brand of drip caused fractal Frangipani flowers to bloom behind her eyes. At least Charlie was a little more moderate and stuck to the performance focused line.   Felix tried not to judge. It wasn't really harming anyone. The more hardcore ones he disagreed with. Certainly he hoped his daughter did not dabble in the narcotic variations.   \"Hey, Felix! We need to ask you something.\" The familiar chirpy voice pulled his mind off his thoughts. Alice, from marketing. He turned around with a smile to answer her question.   Little H & M emblems floated over her eyes as she approached.   Jesus...   -",

A senate hearing is being called today for the Secret Service's failure to protect the President last Saturday. Experts attribute it to a breakdown in protocol related to non-functional radios, poor security screening at the venue, and poorly trained contractors. It is believed that the radios operated within a frequency range which Ford's Theater suppressed to prevent cell phone use. The jammer was registered with the FCC, further calling into question the Services polices.   The accused perpetrator, Booth is being held without bail.

She finds a video and realizes she just witnessed a murder. Then she sees the killer coming up the trail alone. Standing there with two phones now, it looked all too obvious. He started sprinting at her.   With a scream she runs the opposite direction. She could run down the trail which hairpins gradually back around to the car park, or cut through the forest, off the trail, to get to the cars, and hopefully people, faster.   She chose the latter, and now all she could hear was her own breathing and pumping blood along with snapping branches. She glanced behind to see the looming figure getting closer. She let out another scream. Looking ahead the car park was getting closer. Her car sat alone. She tripped.   She scrambled to find anything to protect herself with. He emerged from the trees yelling, \"Give me that FUCKIN...\", he was cut short as a thick branch pierced his torso. He hung over her, blood dripping across her shirt. She had simply pointed one end up and his own weight did the rest. It was sheer luck.   She slowly crawled out and his body sagged to the side. She slowly made her way to the car in complete shock. She stumbled out of the clearing, her face dirty, covered in that monsters blood. She reached down for her phone, she needs to call someone. Nothing.... she glanced back, she dropped the phone.... both of them.   Her silent shock was broken by the sound of a car hitting the loose gravel surface of the car park. She walked toward them for salvation.   It stopped. She was confused, she looked down at herself and then back to the car, \"No... no wait!!\". It quickly turned around and left. She made her way back to the car. With frustration she hit the glass. Her keys were in the phone case. \"DAMN it\", she yelled into the silent crisp forest. She needed to retrace her steps.   Trembling, she enters into the forest once again, \"What... Where is the body?\"",

  "After finishing a set at an old bar, a washed up musical legend is approached by someone who just wants to jam with him.... that someone is Satan Johnny Lavisser strung the last verse of the song as the crowd applauded. As Johny smiled, his brown sports coat kept him warm from the winter's cold that leaked through the cracks in the bar walls. Even though the memories of standing center stage of an enormous stadium filled his mind, he still smiled. However, a sudden cold wind perked up the hairs on Johnny's neck and he immediately packed up his instrument.   The audience called out. \"Encore, encore! Don't pack up yet!\"   Johnny simpered and gave a light wave of his hand. \"Sorry, everyone, I have an appointment to run to. But don't worry, I'll be back the same time next week. Don't forget to tip your waitresses.\"   The crowd groaned, but applauded.   When Johnny jumped off the stage, instrument case in hand, an old man stepped out from behind the bar and grasped Johnny's shoulder. \"You alright, Johnny? Not like you to bail on a performance.\"   Johnny's eyes darted left and right, the hairs on his neck never settling. \"Sorry, Chris, but I do have to leave. No charge for tonight, ok?\"   Chris sighed and let go of Johnny. \"Alright. I hope you'll be alright.\"   Johnny nodded. \"I will be.\" He then headed out of the bar.   ***   After an hour of driving on the interstate, Johnny pulled his car over to the side of the road and took his instrument case out of the backseat. \"Alright, you son of a bitch, let's get round 3 over with.\"   From a puff of smoke, the devil appeared just as Johnny remembered him. \"So eager now, Johnny? You acted so scared back at the bar.\"   \"I just figured you wouldn't want your third ass kicking to be public. If you want, we can go back.\"   Satan chuckled and shook his head. He snapped his fingers and a small fiddle appeared in his hand. \"A brand new record deal for your soul and what's rightfully mine.\"   ``'Rightfully yours'?\" Johnny smirked as he opened up his case and took out his golden fiddle. \"You lost this fair and square.\"   \"Do we have a deal?\"   \"Sure.

When the woman in a raggedy black cloak told me I had to meet you all before I could be judged I shrugged it off, and.... well I sort of did an Ebeneezer Scrooge impersonation.

I'm not trying to harp on you personally, or whatever life choices led you to believe Clown school was.... how did you phrase it?'Your calling.'

  "Every ten years you're allowed to have a conversation with your ten-year-younger self, but only the senior remembers the conversation. 20 year old you wakes up from talking to 30 year old you with one word carved on their arm... I was diagnosed with clinical depression in my late teens, though it was likely a part of me years before. I knew about the conversations with my younger self every ten years (everyone did it), and fortunately with the help of therapy and medication I lasted until I was 20.   I woke up, eager to see what word I would have on my arm. Looking down, I saw what would keep me going for at least another ten years: \"LIVE\".   From that moment forward, I did my best to keep a positive attitude. Through college I volunteered at every chance, and though it took me a while, I eventually graduated with a degree. My parents were thrilled, and things were looking up. I got an internship at a local start-up, started dating a girl I knew from school, and would make sure to look at my arm at least once a day, as though to say \"I will.\"   When I was 26, my girlfriend dumped me. It hurt more than you could imagine, and the depression came back in full force. It affected my job, and I was eventually let go. I wound up moving back in with my parents, which didn't help anything but I had little choice in the matter.   There were several times I thought about ending it all. But every time, I would look down at my arm and see that four-letter word that always kept me going. Thinking on it, I realized I would be in a better place in my 30s, enough so that I would make sure I'd use the one word to keep my past self alive to see it.   Things turned around again when I was 28. I got a new, much better job, and could finally afford a really nice one-bedroom apartment in the city. My colleagues and I got along great, and I wound up dating a coworker's roommate for a while. It didn't last, but I was back out there again, feeling better. The depression retracted, albeit slowly, but it was enough to get me to 30. Seeing my 20-year-old self, I simply instructed him to live.   The next day I woke with a smile, pleased with my conversation to help my past self and obsessively curious as to what new word I'd have on my arm this time.   Only, there wasn't one.   ******************   *For more eerie stories, check out /r/Zchxz! *",

He sat there, crouching like a normal kid he was, when they just discovered something new, especially from under the ground. He poked the blue box with his plastic shovel, still confused about the container in it. Truthfully, he was hoping to see a dinasour bone or a secret treasure that was hided by the pirate themselves. Instead, he was greeted by a weird looking, greep plastic, with a wire on it, and a red-black military clothing that seems to fit for a 20 year old man.   Christopher, was upset with the discovery when he finnaly processed the item inside the box. He threw the clothes back, and smashed the box with the opener. He slammed it back to the hole, and return to his home, crying out of frustration.   Sadly, his action won't stopped the prophecy. Whatever he do, either to be nice or neutral. He still going to be the bad guy.",
  "[ PI ] The Ghosts of Decisions Past - MarContest - 11,531 Hey, I really liked some of the dialogue in this story. Some very poignant phrases, especially the bit about decisions where Waterson discusses choices.   My only qualm is that it feels a bit rushed, there's a lot of development going on very quickly, and because of that some character motivation can be a bit unclear. But I still really enjoyed it, some of the lines are really impressive, just a bit more context would be nice.   Small question, was Harry's dad really a refugee? He was shot by Mastar forces and knew Pat'd dad for some reason, I felt like there was more going on there.",
  "You have a white noise sleep machine. One night when the sleep machine is set to sound like an office/work environment you hear something strange in the background. As I lay awake in bed, listening to my expensive as hell white noise machine ($ 9300!), my mind wandered. Are the people in the \"office\" actually real workers, or did somebody pay them to scribble useless things, staple useless pieces of paper together, mash useless keys on useless keyboards? Better yet, what's the difference between that and a normal office environment? If you really get down to it, work is just a distraction from the true wonders of life, whatever they may be.   The noise hushed. I looked over at the machine. It seems to be functioning perfectly. I was about to roll out of bed and give it a good kick when it started blaring sirens. Did I set an alarm on it? I checked the manual quickly. Nope. You can't even set an alarm on the machine. However, tucked between two paragraphs about proper cord use and storage, a single line caught my eye.   \"The office setting is a real office at the facilities of CERN.\"   As I tried to process this information, a voice said, loud and clear, \"Prepare for 13 TeV pulse. Repeat, prepare for 13 TeV pulse.\"   What in the world was a Tev? I pulled out my phone to search it up on Google. As I typed in \"CERN TEV\", the same voice said, in a panicked tone, \"Prepare for black hole, code 413. Code 413, black hole formation.\" Screams emanated from the machine. The last thing I heard before the machine fizzled and died was \"The black hole's closed. Wait, what are those things? Hel-\"   No time to waste. I rushed down to my garage and picked up my trusty crowbar. It was time to go to Switzerland.",
  "Aliens come to Earth to study the most exotic skill in the universe - sarcasm. \"Do you ever wonder if perhaps there is such a thing as taking a joke too far?\" Matan asked as she stared at her Introduction to Sarcasm textbook, trying to will the dry words to stick in her brain. \"Because if there is, then we might have passed that mark some fifty years ago.\"   \"You have to admit it's funny,\" said Navan, her roommate, who was reading a book on the history of muakhe cinema.   \"Pathetic, more like,\" Matan sighed, shutting her textbook and pushing it away. So far, her Oxford experience had had a few hiccups. The University was one of the most prestigious centers of higher learning in the entire spinward sector, and it had been an honor for Matan to be accepted. She had wanted to learn science, philosophy, literature, a thousand other subjects - but, because of that stupid, stupid joke made so long ago, she had to slog through a course about *sarcasm, * of all things.   The whole debacle had started seventy-five years ago, when the bezzahn had first been introduced into galactic society. More specifically, it had been at a gala held to celebrate the new member of the Galactic Union. A human and a bezzahn had struck up a conversation, and at some point the human made a sarcastic remark. The bezzahn, who had been enjoying more oekho-made ale than necessary, was briefly confused, and had asked for clarification. The human, who had also been enjoying the oekho ale, misconstrued the bezzahn's confusion as being caused by a lack of understanding of sarcasm. The bezzahn, recognizing a potential for hilarity, kept it going, acting taken aback by the concept of'saying something that you don't mean, but it's not really lying, it's more like joking, I guess', as the human clumsily put it.   \"Incredible,\" the bezzahn had said. \"I am amazed that, in the thousands of years our society has existed, we never considered such a concept. Please, tell me more.\"   And so, the entire bezzahn species got in on the joke, and entered the galaxy while pretending to be the only spacefaring species in existence with no understanding of sarcasm. It had been funny for the first fifty or so years, but Matan thought it was going stale. She was taking a course on sarcasm at *Oxford, * for fuck's sake. She could be taking that lecture on Shakespeare that had looked so good, but it conflicted with the sarcasm class and nobody back home would have ever forgiven Matan if she had forsaken acting like an innocent, too-trusting bezzahn for the sake of a class on some silly human poet.'*Bard, *' Matan would have thought petulantly.   The bezzahn understood sarcasm, yes. They had been constantly sarcastic for seventy-five years now. What they didn't understand, Matan was starting to realize, was when to let a joke *die. *   -- -   You don't have to click on this [ link ] (http: //theballadsofirving.com). But you should.",
  "Today... I woke early, as I always did on Mondays. I predicted that it would be a typical Monday. My Over my bacon, eggs, and coffee, I studied my notes. Everything had to be perfect because there would be no margin for error. I only got one chance and if I missed it, then the chance would never come again. I had come to accept that over the years, and I never missed.   I drove across town and parked with less than a minute to spare. I was right on time. I entered the side door of the apartment complex, I knew it wouldn't be locked. I had checked it a dozen times. I used my phone to hack into the security cameras and point them all away from the direction I was taking. By the time anyone realized it, I would be gone.   I darted up the stairs and exited on the third floor. It was quiet, most of the guests wouldn't even be awake yet. One would, because she always left at exactly 5:42 in the morning. There was a spot close enough to her door that was covered in a slight shadow. It was dark enough for me to hide.   When she opened her door, I made my move. Her keys were in her hand, but she never got a chance to lock her door. I came up behind her and tapped her ribs with the stun gun. It was enough to incapacitate her. She crumbled into my arms. I pushed her door open and pulled her back inside. I took one look and confirmed there were no witnesses.   I only had a few minutes, but I had to make the most of it. I carefully ransacked her apartment, as quiet as I could. I grabbed as much of her jewelry as I could fit in my pockets, anything to make this look like a robbery. There was only one thing I was really there for, and I got that with one of her kitchen knives. She faded quickly, no fighting or screaming, no fear or anxiety. It was better that way.   When it was over, I calmly exited her apartment, locked the door, and retracted my path to my car. Once outside, I reactivated the security cameras and drove away. I had to be at work in 30 minutes and it was a 20 minute drive. I was right on time. Small talk over reports followed, then more coffee and several meetings. Afterwards, I picked up my girlfriend and we went out for drinks.   Just as I predicted, it was a typical Monday.",

  "Describe an object within five feet of you in as much detail as possible. There's a window to hell not more than five feet away from me. A thick glass portal, secured by wrought German iron thicker than my finger, encasing the flaming chaos within, blasting the tamed fire through as a plaque of heat like an oblong roar. The iron is black, blank as the void and hot as the stars, hot enough to blister the skin if you are over come by the inner voice of fatalism and touch the hell-gate. The frame is embellished with silver knobs and handles - a daft idea, or trap, tricking you into believing the searing heat can not touch you there. A large dial, ornate and robust dictates with arcane and strange powers how hot hell burns.   Inside the window, the devilry is obscured by violent stalagmites of wrought iron, black on blazing red and orange. The flames are fueled by peat and wood and coal, plants past and present and long since vanished, damned as one in the black iron crucible. They char, then flicker, then blaze as the ever-shifting faces of devils, demons and sprites flash and fade in the luminescent strata of expanded grain.   They are punished by flame, serve their minutes, before their souls are released and their bodies collaspe into ash, purged and free, innocent in their demise. And from the ashes the occasional spark, ember of sin unburnt survives, to start the penitence anew on the morrow.   It's a stove.",

It twinkled between the glossy, varied shades of green foliage and lily pads.  The entire meadow and scene was beautiful on this tender blue morning with not a cloud in the sky.  However as if spotlit, a single water lily stood out, one exquisite bloom, center stage.

  "What do you as a writer self-identify your writing style as? I like to write about a lot of things but have definitely taken to writing about death, God, religion, etc. I don't write much outside of this sub.   I like writing in first person and using a limited omniscient sort of writing where I reveal the thoughts of whoever I am writing about, and no one else.

Perhaps in this universe it would be a millisecond off the speed of light. Or maybe a nanoscopic change to the gravitational ratio. No, this time she would simply add in a *drop* more nitrogen.   She took pleasure in her job. The foremost reason was being able to watch the results of her labour take on a life of their own. She would observe in silent awe as gasses coalesced and created solid, compact masses. She would watch as these masses spun dizzyingly around giant clumps of gas, which in turn danced around great dark pockets. It was like watching an elemental ballet play out before her. Like it was being performed just for her.   She had created a million universes and each was as different to the last as a dream is to reality. She added the last drop of nitrogen. There was a tiny blast. The gasses began to unfurl, their wisp like arms reaching out in an exploratory gesture. She wondered what secrets this universe had to share with her.   -- -- -- --   This was unexpected. Life. She could not have predicted it.   These creatures were not dissimilar to herself and yet they were completely incomparable. She watched on with fascination as the creatures changed and developed.

Killed in her name. They learned to travel from rock to rock. They abandoned forever their own rock which had been pocketed by craters and polluted by toxins. They colonised other blue rocks but no rock ever lasted long. The creatures spread through the universe like a plague. They broke off into factions and fought and killed.

If it wasn't for all the news helicopters and SWAT units buzzing around him, he might've been amused by the sight of himself.   He had managed to kill three people and wound four in his animalistic rage, that nobody glued to the nearest screens could see the motivation behind. He simply walked up to the doors at the end of the farthest hallway and shot at everybody in sight. He knew the procedure that the school would follow, the principal would bark \"LOCKDOWN\" into the PA system, and all the teachers would lock their doors, kill the lights, and do head counts. A recent graduate of Whelan High knew these procedures very well, and he abused them at the perfect times to raise the stakes for those watching at home.   Three more deaths later, and he got cocky.

  "It is discovered that Possession works both ways and now we can have some payback. Demons of the underworld are now suffering under multiple cases of Humanic Possession. \"We haven't had a problem like this before, Gammorah\"   \"Explain to me what happened again\" he said, trying to feign concern, through his chuckling.   \"They were in mock torment class. Raem was put in the fake shackles when I was about to present the class with the flay method of torture. Before I can even begin, I hear Raem scream, \"Muh freedamns!\" while loosing himself from the mock bindings. He then proceeded to eat everything in sight, breathe heavily behind others walking, and only was he finally subdued after we caught him watching a clock asking, what bong it is. I'm not sure what we're going to have to do to get this problem to stop, but it's making a mockery of all we stand for.\"",
  "[ IP ] Winter is last forever.... humanity may not last long. They just announced that we has dried the last known oil source. After the volcanic eruption send layers of layers of dark cloud that covered all parts of earth from the sun several years ago and now it snows even on the equator, that's our main source of energy, even more than before. This winter happening all over the world make it impossible to produce food if not for energy we gain from oil and technique to grow them within heated room. Still, most people died from hunger and cold, and now we are going to lose one thing that make survival possible for most people that still alive by now. Most hydro-power stopped because the water has turned into ice and no sunlight means no solar power, the cold broke wind turbines too. Only the geothermal and nuclear energy remained, and they are not enough.   This winter seemed to last forever. Only choice to survive is to take over the last working energy generator. But we might not going to survive this battle. In fact, I need to stop this battle, or there might none of us remained.",
  "Your amnesia is continuing to develop. Damn it why can't I remember anything? Where was I yesterday? Was there anything important that happened? Probably not? The days all blend together after a while anyway. Same stuff over and over again. But something's wrong today. I can't even recall if I did any writing. That's my favorite part of the day. I walk over to my journal. The last entry was four years ago. What? That's impossible. I wrote after making love to Sandy. I watched her breathing slowly. There's a poem in here. She'll know. Sandy always knows.   I step out of the room and call out for her.   \"Philip? I just went to check on something.\" A voice calls back. An older lady steps into the hallway. Scrubs? Why is a nurse in my house? I ask her where Sandy is.   \"Philip, I think it would be best if you went back to bed.\" She says. I run back into the room. No way. Where's Sandy? I hide in the closet and keep the door cracked open. The nurse walks in and looks around. She spots me.   I need to hide, but there's nowhere to go. I'm trapped.   \"Philip. Come on out. Let me read you the last entry of that journal you're holding.\" She says. I didn't even read it. Maybe it will tell me where Sandy is. I walk out and hand the journal to the nurse. She gestures to the bed and I sit down. She flips to a page effortlessly and begins:   \"Philip Terrance. You're losing your memory. You've already begun to forget what day it is. Soon you'll probably forget who people are, who you are. Who knows? Maybe you'll forget what language is. Revert back to a speechless child. Then you won't remember how to read this and someone will read it to you and maybe you won't know what they're saying. But I love you.\" The nurse closes the book. I don't understand. She smiles and puts her hand on mine.   \"I wrote that. Many years ago, when you started developing amnesia.\" She says. But that's my journal.   \"This isn't your journal. It's mine. You never wrote, but you admired me for keeping a journal.\" What? No. I remember writing. Don't I? She grasps my hand tighter.   \"You don't remember any specifics to writing do you? Just a general memory? That's because you're remembering a bit wrong. I'm your wife Sandy and you're Philip. We've been married for 30 years. And you have amnesia.\" It must be hard for her to say this to me.   Then, a stranger is holding my hand. She's holding a book and smiling at me. Where's Sandy?",
  "Exercising Your Subtext Skills The flash from the tech's camera lit up the droplets of condensation which were starting to pool around the base of the glass. One of the uniforms knocked against the table and the amber swayed like an abandoned see-saw. The tech waited for the liquid to settle and moved to the other side of the room and snapped again. He looked down at the LCD screen and hit delete. He snapped again. Still no good, too much lens flare off the glass, shining with moisture. He moved closer and say something on the glass he hadn't noticed before. There was a smudge of lipstick, a pristine finger print. He snapped once more, and moved on to the living room.",
  "The mega office buildings of the future have grown so huge that a nomadic people developed who travel from office wing to wing, subsisting on leftover doughnuts, birthday cakes, and pizza parties. \"Get to the Hard Drive Fields, and don't stop for nothin'. I'm much older and slower than you, so just get your ass there, and hide. I'll be there as soon as I can.\" Avi whispers to his grandson.   Six o'clock sends a rush of darkness and silence through the halls like a wave of death as the fluorescents kick off simultaneously. Avi's young grandson Karl hadn't been living here a full year. He had not yet witnessed the chaos of the post-Christmas party delirium. Young Karl was not aware that his grandfather stored food throughout the frozen cooling tanks in the underground fields, and Karl had not gone hungry, so he was not aware of the desperation that hunger brings.   The wave of darkness hits them, and Karl is sure he could feel it hit his skin. That feeling would dissipate as a much heavier rumbling bounces around in his chest. It is the pitter patter of feet weighed down by the fury of survival. Karl looks out of the Xerxes Toner Printer door he and his grandfather call home to witness a swarm of more hall dwellers stamping down their hall, B-Street.   \"Go Karl! Now! Run as fast as you can! Grab all you can! I will do my best to hold them off!\" Avi screams over the rumbling.   Karl takes off down the hall, his tote bags bouncing on all sides of him on their oversized leather straps, full of space reserved for party scraps. His thick rubber shoes squeak on the linoleum tiles, which reminds him of the year he spent at a real school, and he played kickball with other kids his age. He wouldn't realize how much he enjoyed that until it was gone. Now here he is, running up the corporate ladder hoping to catch a few crumbs.   Upon reaching the end of the hall, Karl takes a quick look back to see his grandfather standing in the middle of the hall with his arms spread wide. Someone clips his left shoulder at top speed, dislocating it immediately. Even over the yelling, Karl hears his grandfather's screams as he is battered like a rag-doll, slowing a humble fifteen maniacal nomads. Not enough to matter. Karl turns back and pushes the door opened. It is now that he realizes his journey from here on out may be full of trials and tribulation, but he also knows the importance of what it means to survive.   \"Here we go...\"",
  "the most detailed image yet comes back from Pluto, revealing the frozen remains of a civilisation. It transpires that the planet was thrown into its current orbit during a space war. Humanity scrambles to avoid the same fate for Earth. I never knew this is gon na happen. I was thinking hard trying to prepare a response. If being the president of this country was not difficult enough.   \"They have taken this too far now\" I thought shaking my head.   I called my secretary to arrange a meeting with the New horizons team.   \"Oh screw that! cancel their AMA and send them in my office as soon as possible. Its an order!\" I punched the words through the phone.   The New horizons team arrived in under one hour. Of course I arranged a private jet for them, though it may have created some skeptics and some conspiring media headlines but who cares I want this mess to be cleared up.   We sat in the meeting hall.   Silence.   \"What is this? Do you have any answer prepared for this ha!? You guys think that this government can cover up such things every single time?\" I break the ice.   \"Sir, I'm sorry this was just a hoax to gain more attention and funds. We are trying...\"   \"Hoax! for god sake have you seen what this has done. People are scared. They want answers from me. The whole world is waiting for my word.\"   \"But sir, If we can continue this for a little longer, we can become the central power of the world. Our economy would be the strongest.\"   \"No! no no not anymore. I can't lie more. Elon musk would find the truth anyway we need..\"   \"Sir we have arranged a contract killer for him, he is an insider the same guy who loaded the explosives in the Falcon 9 - CRS7...\"   \"Listen you prick! First never *ever* cut me off again ok second I had enough of this fake appreciation. The world needs to know the truth.\"   \"But sir..\"   \"No! You know I was 11 when we reached the moon for the first time and that was my reality\" I got up from my chair \"until I become the President and after all those years just to realize it was all *fake*\"   Silence.   \"And for what, just to win a bloody space race! we cant play with their emotions now\" I gestured towards my secretary.   \"Call the media. We have a lot of explaining to do.\"",
  "Use a Civ 5 (or any civ) game you've played to inspire a story. from one of my Civ 4 games (never played 5 on account of my shit pc)   \"Sire?\"  Emperor Wang Kon raised his head and focused his sight on the aged stocky adviser. Did he dose off again? Four hours of sleep doesn't appear to cut it anymore. Not good   \"We've just got word from Cuzco, the Incas, they...\"  \"They declared war.\" It was just a matter of time, he suspected the pompous boasts and threats from Huayna Capac to be more than hot air.  \"Ah, yes they are starting to mobilize their forces towards the northern provinces.\"  \"How many troops do we have stationed in Pyongyang and Wonsan?\"  \"Three battalions each, Your Grace.\"   They will hold for a while, the emperor imagined. The main Korean force, however, were still engaged in grueling skirmishes across the island nation of Mongolia. Kublai Khan's troops were under-equipped and used outdated weaponry, but the were numerous, and the Mongolian sovereign did not shy from throwing piles of them at Korean riflemen squads.   The emperor stood up. His joints cracked and creaked, God he felt old. \"The Mongolians resolved to a war of attrition it seems, send a letter to Kublai, he is cruel and shallow, but not foolish. We will offer peace and he will accept it.\" After he drains our treasuries for reparations, of course.   He started walking across the great imperial hall. The adviser joined his brisk pace, still holding notes, maps and letters in his small stubby hands. \"We have other news sire, the Indians, they have sworn fealty to the Inca empire.\"   \"Of course they have,\" Wan Kon murmured increasing his pace, \"what else would a lick-spittle like Gandhi do?\" The vile jealous Indians, always plotting and scheming. They have soldiers, however, and tanks and bombers and missiles, that would rain on Korean cities if Wang failed his duty.   \"See if you can get word from the Mayans and Greeks, they have no fondness for the Incas and I'll be damned if they are willing to forsake trade relations with us, no matter how intimidating Huayna's legions might seem.\"   \"Yes Your Grace.\" The adviser lowered his head and promptly removed his presence.  The emperor raised his head to the magnificent tapestries scattered across the great palace walls. They told stories of ancient glory and conquest. Of song and play. And, most importantly, the great victory in the war against the mighty Egyptian kings. He felt so small, so insignificant, so fearful.",
  "You have won a trip to visit the factory of [ any real life company ]. It is literally as magical as Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. I've got some friends who work for Dupont, a plastics and chemicals manufacturing company. They rant about control systems and stress strain curves all day. So this will be fun.  -- -- --   I got off the bus with 5 other people more or less my age. they all have some kind of flexible and tough sheet in their hand similar to carbon fiber. They were all very friendly and eager, almost desperate to sieze up the competetion, ahem, I mean make connections. They were all talking about complicated subjects, non-newtonian behaviours, models, control systems, algorithms, and trying to one-up each other with things that I don't really understand. I'm just a paint technician who have been painting for years. I'm one of those people who like watching paint dry.   As soon as I stepped off the bus, the doors to the corporation opened, and out stepped a flamboyant man, dressed in a shimmering unearthly cloth. \"Greetings and salutations!\" He boomed, \"Welcome to Dupont's main manufacturing headquarters! I am Doug D.D. Dupont! We hope that you enjoy our little tour, and please, hold your questions until the end.\" Our small group looked like a pack of hungry wolves, eager to show their knowledge of the manufacturing process and impress their potential future employer. Nontheless, we obeyed and continued to follow him into the building.   The first room was a plain reception area. the receptionist stood up from her computer and gave us guest passes. They were made of an odd material. One or two others seemed to notice this but the rest just glossed over it.   We were led past the well lit areas containing the labs and offices to a dark corner that's very much been lacking upkeep. Tucked there was a service elevator. It was cramped, and I didn't particularly mind being pushed up against the women who were dolled up for this occasion. Our tour guide was giddy. As if he just can't wait to show us what's behing door number 1.   The elevator door opens and we pile out of the cramped space.   -- -- --   It's late. I'm going to sleep.",
  "As a dragon of innumerable age you have guarded your gold horde for millennium. Many heroes have come with long speeches on how they will slay you, the great evil, none finish. However this one is odd.He throws a coin on your stash, looks you in the eyes and says \"I have a proposition for you.\" The dragon in it's very nature is a creature of greed. I am one such creature. But whilst I call myself a collector, these humans call me monster. They send their best to slay me, to claim my possession for their own. Hmph. Not even the greatest and brawniest of their warriors could kill me.   The dragon of promise is what I came to be known as. While my brothers and sisters were hunted to near extinction I live on. They can't harm me, and it's all thanks to you *предатель*. You didn't surprise me when you came to me. Many have before. Your confidence confused me to say the least. You. A creature of the light walking so pridefully into my lair, and using the old tithe to request audience with me angered me very much. But the dragon is patient, and thus I listened to your request. I recall the words perfectly.   \"We are born from the light, but bring nothing but darkness, death and destruction to this world. At our core, humans are sick beings. I know of your hate for us, so I ask this of you. Grant me power and I shall lay waste to those that murdered your siblings.\" The physical death meant nothing for me, for the spirit of the dragon is immortal. I remember as you carried me out of this cave I had made mine, and into the sun for the first time in a millennia. In this new form. Clad in my bones, humanity would tremble at your feet.   So give me your arm, oh bearer mine. Let me help you fill the world with teeth.",
  "Turns out it wasn't the Nazis hiding on the dark side of the moon. It was the Roman Empire. They've come back with a vengeance. \"Preparing to breach atmosphere, Legate!\"   \"Let it be done, captain.\"   Legate Caecilius Petrus Belisarius stood tall on the bridge of his titanic flagship *Cerberus*. His brilliant red cape fell almost to the floor behind him, secured by gold sunbursts on the front of his shoulders. His helmet was ridged with a large bristle of equally brilliant red horse hair. His breastplate, specially commissioned for the occasion, bore an elaborate engraving of a massive bull, horns lowered and charging. The bull's hooves pounded through stylized waves, whipping them up into a foam. The legate's boots and greaves were of burnished bronze, reflecting the blinking yellow and red lights of the console before him.   He stood on a high platform at the rear of the bridge. Below him, his men, dressed in more practical solid black, tight-fitting uniforms, worked efficiently at three banks of consoles. The bright blue earth filled the enormous window in front of them.   The engines came to life with a deep roar that filled the whole ship. Legate Belisarius felt just a small shudder before the inertial dampeners kicked in. The earth began to rotate downwards in the window as the captain oriented the ship for atmospheric entry. In a few moments, the window was filled with the blackness of space, which was quickly replaced with a red, fiery glow.   This was the critical moment. The *Cerberus* was an enormous vessel, eight stadia long -- over a kilometer, by the engineers' measure -- and two stadia across at its widest point. If they would fail, it would be here. Should the heat shields fail, or if the structure was not able to withstand the colossal stress, then they would break up in the atmosphere. Belisarius took solace in the fact that if either of those two things happened, they would likely not have more than a quarter second to realize what had happened before they were all burned to ash.   But the *Cerberus* held steady. This was solid Roman engineering -- designed by descendants of the ones who built the aqueducts and the Coliseum, built to last for three thousand years or more.   The ship glowed bright red, like a coal, as they burned through the sky. Seconds later, there were three more coals burning as more ships breached the atmosphere. Then a dozen. Then a hundred, as *Legio X Fretensis* began the invasion.   The die was cast.",
  "Hell has burnt out so they decided to create a New Hell and move everyone there. However, you overslept and missed the move. Now, you're sealed within the Old Hell as it gets colder and colder. Hell wasn't that bad, maybe I've got a good tolerance for pain but it never really bothered me to begin with. Demons weren't scary, punishments often came and went but we knew we deserved them. The best part about hell was at least we were surrounded by people, I had loneliness issues in life and it made me do my fair share of bad things. Being punished in hell has made sense of it to me. I was a hormonal teenager and a dick. Putting cyanide in the party mix just cause the host locked me in a cold, dark locker a few months back wasn't the best reaction, to be honest. I've always had trouble with small dark places too and that just did it for me. Plus when everyone took the hosts side and left me on my own I figured that if I had to be alone, so did everyone else. I drunk it myself to avoid getting in trouble and lo and behold, we all get sent to hell. Cindy and her twin sister Mindy (total bitches by the way) screamed and shouted at me, Derek (the crass ass who locked me in the locker) tried to throttle me before demons pulled him off me and Sarah (the girl I was crushing on who was dating Derek) just straight up cried when she realised they were all in hell because they were such good people apparantly. Well, after about 40 years we made peace with each other and we learned to just move past things. We became friends and actually had fun, regardless of all the torturing going around us. For the first time in my life and unlife, I was pretty happy, ironic considering the circumstances. Thats why when we were all rounded up for Newhell, we were excited to head over there, see exactly what all the curfuffle Satan made was about. We were last in line that felt like eternity but we made it through cracking jokes with each other and laughing a lot (honestly I think we bothered the other souls). It was finally our turn and we all went through, one by one. First Sarah (still as beautiful as ever), then Derek (my best friend), then Cindy and Mindy (lovably bitchy girls), then me. Before I was pulled back by the head demon. I was wondering what the problem was when he headed through the portal and it closed behind him. Its getting lonely and its really cold and dark in here...",
  "Every person has the ability to go back and change the past exactly once. But if anything too significant is changed, everyone influenced directly by the change turns into the mental equivalent of a vegetable. Survivor bias.   After the happening, there was much excitement and fear over mankind's new power. Pundits and preachers alike screamed the world was headed to hell within a week.   As it turned out, the very nature of changing the past made the activity quite self limiting. And Mankind caught on quick. Change too much and pay dearly. Change too little and no one noticed anyway. The wreckage of a change gone wrong lay everywhere. The monuments to a change gone right? Well, those were too tiny to see.   The only feedback was from the events they could see the effect of. When something went wrong. It had been years since there was a confirmed case of time travel.   Survivor bias.   The PSAs still ran though. On every station during every program. Samantha knew the risk. Everyone did. If anyone still took the chance, no one talked about it. There was some doubt if mankind still possessed the ability at all.   Ten years in this place. Ten years of the orderlies half smiles. Ten years of visits from the elementary school chorus, once at Easter, once at Christmas.   Samantha was sore. Someone had turned the heat down. Being cold always made her sore. She glanced over at the alarm clock. 1AM. The chairs in the senior center were too hard for her these days but her bed seemed a trip too far.   She returned her focus to the TV. The PSA stopped and the channel cut to infomercials. Samantha frowned. She closed her eyes, bit her lip, and stepped through time.   Things were much brighter. The garage door was opened directly on the sun. Paul was in the passenger seat, clutching his chest. He'd loose consciousness any minute now.   Samantha looked on her husband for the last time again. She chose to smile this go round.   She took Paul's hand from his chest and held it tight. Paul, too, managed a smile this time.   Samantha closed her eyes, turned the key, pressed the remote to close the garage door, and asked a small favor of the universe.   \"Please, let us be just small enough.\"",
  "God has been locked out/denied access to Heaven. Elaborate on the events leading to, and stemming from it. *I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End. *   I never was a fan of what they wrote about me.... too preachy- for lack of a better word. They got most things wrong anyway. Too much misdirected hate, too vague and given to blind bishops to interpret. But that one line.... I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End. They knew from the start that it ends with me. *to this day they think they can banish me from my domain. They couldn't possibly understand what its like. To invest everything in humanity for what- a mangled planet run ragged, stripped down to its bones, a barren realm of hate and sin? *   Perhaps I did go too far this time. I swore to never destroy in a fit of wrathful vengeance their meager lives again. In this lie I became as human as any other. Souls lay in wait at my doorstep, judgement being passed proves difficult without myself.   They could never understand the weight on my shoulders, the overbearing guilt for every death, life, death.... I had eons before to plan this folly, countless follies to date, each ending the same. Time does stop eventually, this I see, though there will be countless attempts before all is said and done. How I long for the end.... repitition is maddening."
