There will be no mistaking what happened before and what will happen next. It used to be that a city could vanish under a cloud of ash in an instant, but now, the great powers prefer to slowly grind their enemies into oblivion through relentless warfare. This method burrows into their psyche, becoming a part of their identity, until their old selves are left to wither in a world where such knowledge is useless.

Perhaps it had taken too long. Children often perceive things that adults overlook, and Susan had sensed this coming for months, maybe even years. Late night arguments, when they assumed she was fast asleep. Voices raised loudly enough to shake the fixtures and rattle the walls. It was inevitable that this day would come, the day when her life would be uprooted and she\u2019d be whisked away to a far-off place\u2014it was astonishing it had taken this long.\n\nOn this fateful day, she found herself sitting on her bed, staring at the now barren walls. Posters and pictures that made the room hers had disappeared. Yesterday, they had stripped the entire room\u2014her toys, clothes, games; her whole world packed into a van because her parents could no longer tolerate being near each other, nor even within the same city. Oxford would never feel like home, not like Maidstone did. Forced to leave her school, uprooted from her friends, severed from the life she knew and the people she trusted\u2014gone, just like that.

Light transforms these dark places into welcoming spaces; without it, even palaces feel cold and depressing. Baldin understood this well. The Old Kingdom is filled with forgotten knowledge and artifacts hidden in ruins and abandoned temples. No one would dare explore these dark places without a guiding light.\n\nBaldin preferred solitude, observing people from a distance. At night, a single candle acts like a beacon, attracting adventurers from all over, like moths to a flame. Baldin made sure a lack of light wouldn't stop them. Adventurers love to explore and discover new things but remain unaware of the invisible hand guiding them. They go where Baldin wants them to go.\n\nThough old and forgotten, the caves and ruins are not empty. Traps await the unwary, and the creatures inside can be dangerous. However, great rewards await the brave: Dwarven metals, Dremoran trinkets, Daedric armors, and more. Skyrim boasts some impressive adventurers.\n\nAll thanks to light. Once an adventurer conquers a dungeon and heads home, they follow the lights blindly, even if they've moved. Sometimes they return to find the candles gone. Baldin enjoys playing tricks on his guests. He knows most cannot go days without light. If they can't find their way out, they often go mad, injuring themselves or worse. Or they might try to sleep, leaving all the loot for Baldin.\n\nLight is a marvelous thing.", "Some days, I feel like I'm dying. Other days, I hope I am.

Our emergency escape pod had suffered severe damage on the descent to the planet\u2019s surface. The lightweight, heat-resistant alloys served as makeshift armor for us and our rubber survival raft.\n\nOur only hope was to get out of the natives' territory and reach the Federation outpost downriver. These ape-like creatures, reminiscent of Earth\u2019s gorillas in their survival habits, built \u201cnests\u201d in trees that looked like the treehouses any kid would want. They avoided swimming, preferring to get their hydration from native plants and fruits.\n\nI was supposed to study these primitives to see if they could be educated and integrated into the galactic community. But after two years of observing them from the Federation Cruiser, the *Iaculum*, I doubted they had much potential for advancement. My colleague, meanwhile, had less respect for them, frequently joking about giving peace offerings of bananas.\n\nAs we floated downstream, the natives followed us along the shore, matching our pace. Some carried spiked clubs made from local fauna tails, others had blowguns and crude bows. We only had a small rifle to defend ourselves if the currents ran us aground. The natives believed that water was a portal between the land of the dead and the living, and anything from the water was seen as an undead demon.\n\nMarcus ducked, but thankfully no arrows or darts hit us. For the first time since I met him, fear crossed his face.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I dared to ask.\n\nHe quickly raised his hands, signaling for silence, and listened intently. Peeking over the plating, he said, \u201cOoh, that\u2019s not good. Isaac, do you hear rushing water?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a boat.

Mervyn, our red-soul-patched leader, carefully slipped the scuffed black orb into its handcrafted leather pouch. He looked at the seven of us with a mix of hope and determination. \"Guys,\" he shouted over the harsh winds of what used to be the frozen Jersey Highlands, \"we've wandered far, guided by MMate. Today, it has led us to our new home!\" \n\n\"Hey Merv,\" called Quinten, our cartographer, from the back, \"according to my maps, we're in what's left of Newark.\" Nervous murmurs rippled through our small group. \n\n\"Don't worry, friends!\" Mervyn reassured, \"MMate wouldn't lead us wrong. This is our destined place.\"\n\n\"But isn't this where the old wars started?\" Blandie, our chef, questioned.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Quinten replied, glaring at Mervyn. \"This is ground zero for the first atomic blasts. They said the land here spits fire at anything that touches it.\"\n\nThe wind was the only sound that followed. \n\nQuinten stepped forward, arms outstretched. \"Let me see MMate, Mervyn.\"\n\nMervyn clutched the leather pouch tightly to his chest. \"No!\" he yelled before bolting down the hill. We stood there, watching in shock as he hopped over a glowing brook and held MMate high, shaking it for guidance. Again and again, he shook it, until finally, a scream of rage echoed through the air. It sounded like a beast waking up to find its den filled with useless twigs and old newspapers instead of food for the winter.\n\nMervyn ran off, MMate still held above his head. BOOM. A huge pillar of purple flame shot up, swallowing our leader and our guide in an instant. Mervyn\u2019s charred body hit the ground with a soft thud and a cloud of dust. MMate was flung back toward us from the force of the explosion. Quinten caught it, peering into its melted, charred plastic.

The ruling species of the monarch constantly changes; upon death, the emperor is reincarnated as a member of a different race. You are the first human reincarnation of this ruler. \n\nThe years before ascension have always been my favorite. Born with all the knowledge of my past incarnations, there is little need for me to \"grow up\" or be educated in the nuances of galactic rule. However, long ago, I decreed that each of my reincarnations must reach the age of majority before assuming the throne. Death has not frightened me for millennia; each passing brings new possibilities and a welcome respite from my galactic responsibilities for a few years.\n\nI do not understand the mechanism by which my reincarnation is chosen. Many theories abound. Some species have been blessed half a dozen times, while others never, and on rare occasions, I am reborn into a race yet to join my Empire. These instances I relish with great enthusiasm, as they signify that these races will play a pivotal role in the future of my Empire. Most of them are gifted with advanced technologies or cultures rich in profound philosophies and art.\n\nMy first day on Earth, January 1, 2016, was bewildering. Born into this primitive backwater, the people were vastly different from what I had come to expect from new entrants to my Empire. They had barely ventured into space, their planet was divided into hundreds of squabbling factions, and their culture needed much development. In time, I discovered why: while primitive and weak, these humans possessed a thirst for knowledge, a passion for exploration, and an incredible speed in developing their technological prowess. They were fighters who achieved victory against overwhelming odds repeatedly, and created inspiring art, music, and stories.\n\nI grew up in a place called Florida and learned to enjoy the long, hot summers, mild winters, and the diverse array of scantily clad women the white sand beaches attracted year-round. Eighteen years in this primitive paradise made me melancholy when the Imperial Dreadnought appeared in orbit, eclipsing the moon to announce to my newest subjects their ascension into the Galactic Empire.

Only one being stood in their way. They did not plan to survive, just to survive long enough. The march had been long and arduous, but they had reached the pass. Tomorrow would be the final day of life for most of the soldiers. They had made their peace with God and knew that their sacrifice was necessary to give their families a chance to survive. The pass in front of them was the only link to the outside world, the only way for food to enter the valley. That was until the beast appeared. It killed anything that entered the pass, and the valley had been slowly starving to death due to a drought that destroyed the harvest. Their only hope was to send messengers to the outside to seek the assistance of a legendary warrior. \n\nThe army sat around their campfires, sharing one last round of somber laughs before the battle. The five fastest runners were already asleep, preparing for the mad dash they would attempt through the chaos. They carried the hope of the entire valley.

The creature sat among a pile of bones at the pass\u2019s narrowest point. Its white fur glistened clean and pure, a stark contrast to the blood of those it had slain. Its red eyes glinted with chaos and death. Its nose twitched, beckoning them to try and kill it.\n\nTo most, it was just a rabbit; to these men, it was death. A shout traveled down the line as they charged the beast. In a flash, the creature jumped from man to man, killing each with a mighty chomp of its teeth. In the midst of the chaos, the runners charged, making a beeline through the melee as their comrades swung frantically at the creature.\n\nFour of the runners were felled by the beast, but one made it through the pass. Seeing the mission's success, some soldiers shouted, \"Run away!\" What little remained of the army returned home to spread the word of hope.\n\nAt the opposite end of the valley, the last messenger looked out at the unknown lands to seek the hero of legend, the one unfazed by any wound in battle.

He sat in his office chair, comfortably typing random words on a disconnected keyboard and staring at a blank monitor. It was a warm day, as all days had become.\n\nIt's unclear when things shifted, but as more jobs became obsolete, basic income was introduced. The era of creativity and learning was short-lived. Uprisings and extremist ideologies emerged as people struggled with total freedom from work. This led to the government creating mandatory programs to keep the unemployed busy with community services like working with children and gardening. However, as machines took over useful tasks, a more dependable method to occupy people was needed.\n\nA software program was developed to create a false market where people produced worthless products. It employed everyone from marketers to factory workers to managers, turning humanity into a performance of their past lives. People resisted, but the machines, which controlled food, healthcare, and policing, responded by denying services to \"problematic\" individuals. People started dying and soon complied.\n\nEventually, machines deemed actual production unnecessary. Simply going through the motions of work was enough to satisfy a significant part of the population.

Alarmed, Ernest tried to apologize.\n\n\u201cEileen, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he confessed, \u201cI\u2019ll admit it... I have feelings for you.\u201d\n\nEileen cut him off, sternly, \u201cErnest, stop.

Leave now!\u201d\n\nFeeling awkward and rejected, Ernest left, alone once more.", "At the age of 18, everyone selects an unexpected life event. They will be reborn at 18 each time they die until that event occurs. Following that, death becomes final. It's a concept we call \"death by fulfillment.\" Our society believes that everyone deserves the opportunity to chase their aspirations to the very end. Some individuals craft masterpieces by amassing lifetimes of knowledge. Others simply wish to find joy by experiencing true love, as perfect matches are rare yet achievable given an eternity.\n\nBut I am terrified of death.\n\nMany of my peers still reside with their parents, as it\u2019s likely that both parent and child will not achieve their goals within a single lifetime. However, by an astronomical chance, both my parents have passed away.\n\nMy father, in a moment of brilliance, painted the artwork now displayed in the National Gallery in the capital. I have not seen it. My mother, being the reserved person she was, simply wished to have a child with a man she loved. She lived fewer lifetimes than my father. Nonetheless, she had me and passed away when I was 8. Simply put, my very existence had ended her life.\n\nI am deeply afraid of death.\n\nI still remember that night my mother came home in tears. She was drunk, cursing the fate she had chosen. She had no one to blame but herself. And perhaps me. She might not have meant it\u2014she was drunk. But she yearned to live longer.\n\nShe was terrified of death.\n\nMy mother\u2019s death led my father to withdraw from society, pouring his feelings, accumulated over centuries, into his art when my mother died in a car accident. His masterpiece was one of sorrow and fear, marking the pinnacle of his career at the lowest point of his life. On the same day his painting was displayed in the museum, he took his own life, hanging from a rope tied to the ceiling. His final act of creation. I still haven't seen the painting.\n\nIt seemed only natural that I would wish to die only when I no longer feared death.\n\nMy peers have long passed away now. I live among the next generation. Or perhaps the generation after that. I\u2019ve lost track of time. Love, school, parenthood, adventure\u2014none have eased my fear of death. Perhaps it is finally time to learn from someone who faced death willingly. Perhaps it is finally time to visit the museum.", "God presents you with three doors\u2014each with a unique destiny. Door One promises eternal happiness, insight into a world where sorrow and despair no longer exist. Door Two offers infinite knowledge, the profound wisdom that could unravel the mysteries of life and beyond. Then, there\u2019s Door Three, an enigmatic choice, shrouded in mystery, as God has never opened it.\n\nI stand before these doors, reflecting on their promises. Eternal happiness\u2014what does that even mean? Can such a state truly exist where no depression or setbacks ever touch you? I recall sitting anxiously on the examination table, the harsh, unwavering clock stuck at noon, as I waited for the doctor to deliver my fate. The news was devastating: cancer. The memory of my beautiful wife supporting me until my last bedridden days haunts me. Would eternal happiness mean I could be with her again? But could ignorant bliss truly fulfill me, or would the pursuit of knowledge and understanding bring deeper contentment?\n\nThe third door, though, intrigues me the most. Is it merely an illusion of hope, a temptation of something far greater than happiness or knowledge? Why has no one opened this door before? What secrets does it hold that even God hasn\u2019t revealed? It feels like he's nudging me toward it, but this decision is mine alone.\n\nAs I step closer, the door seems to grow, overwhelming in its presence. God's expression shifts from a knowing smile to a neutral watchfulness. And then, as I grasp the handle, I\u2019m pulled into an abyss of darkness. The door shuts slowly behind me, with God\u2019s eyes fading into the blackness.\n\nIn this void, I hear the distant cries of a woman, an urgent, heavy breathing that guides me towards a faint glimmer of light. Struggling forward, I finally escape the darkness, emerging into a soothing, warm light. My past identity fades, my body submitting to a newfound sense of peace and security.\n\nWrapped in gentle, loving arms, I realize that this journey, the leap of faith into the unknown, has led me to a profound new beginning.", "A child is kidnapped. Outraged, the monsters under her bed and in her closet vow to find her. I watch from close by, never touching. But tonight was different. She was gone, no scent, no breath, no heartbeat. The mother cried. Blue and red lights flashed. She should have been in bed. I spread out like smoke, searching. I found her scent on soft clothes, new hair, and her fear.\n\nI found someone else, like the mother, but different. This person had smoke and alcohol and was in despair. The child was in a metal vehicle. I slipped through the metal. She saw me, screamed, and turned the wheel, hitting a tree. I don't usually touch, but she cried, my small one cried. Today, I would touch and bring her home.", "In a rather peculiar twist of the law, citizens are granted the legal right to commit a single act of murder, provided that all the requisite documentation is completed, and the intended victim is duly informed of the impending threat. Despite this bizarre legality, my living situation was almost enviable. My housemates, though not matching my intellectual prowess, were agreeable companions. Our spacious abode allowed us to coexist without encroaching on each other's lives; we attended our classes, returned home, dined, and paid our bills in harmony. My aspirations to become a doctor were met with respect by my friends, and I felt a deep sense of gratitude for this supportive environment, which was a vast improvement compared to the dormitories. Surprisingly, our house was more tranquil than the rowdy dorms, even if it was somewhat messier. I was content to endure the untidiness for a few more years.\n\nOne evening, an unexpected knock interrupted our routine. Tommy, who was nearest to the door, answered.\n\n\"Jack, it's for you, bro,\" he called out.\n\nFeigning nonchalance, I responded, \"So, let her in.\"\n\nBut Tommy's voice held a note of urgency. \"No, Jack, he says he needs to see you right now in person.\"\n\nA sense of dread washed over me as I glanced at my watch. Had I missed an appointment? If so, I had completely forgotten about it. Standing in the doorway was a man clad in regulation khakis and a standard-issue blue button-down shirt\u2014an official of some sort. He held a small electronic device, which he extended toward me while requesting my signature.\n\nBewildered, I asked, \"What is this?\"\n\n\"Notification. Initial there and there, please,\" he instructed.\n\n\"Is this a delivery or something?\" I questioned.\n\n\"Not exactly. Your answer will appear on the screen momentarily. Initial after scrolling through, and check the box if you wish to reserve the Right of Retribution for your heir.\"\n\n\"My what?\" I echoed, confused, as I initialed the sections he indicated.\n\n\"Look at the screen, sir,\" he directed.\n\nThe screen displayed the words: FUCKED UP THE BELL CURVE\n\nAs I processed the message, a girl from my biology lab emerged from the bushes, brandishing a gun. Shock paralyzed me, and as I turned toward the house, I saw Tommy and the others, hearing\u2014or perhaps imagining\u2014their collective groan. My reality shattered with the sound of two gunshots, and I fell to the ground.", "Beating a game of Snake\n\nWe all start small, moving slowly with no set path. We chase after our goal, sometimes turning and sometimes staying straight. With each success, we grow and become more driven, never stopping or slowing down. Some people don't make it; they hit a wall, wasting their time, effort, and skill. There are no second chances. Those who fail are forgotten, while those who succeed are remembered, their names etched eternally, having found the meaning in this race of life.", "\"I'm fourteen, father. It's time.\" I no longer want to live numb to everything by antidepressants, syringes, and lies. I want to feel pain, see others suffer, and understand the reality we live in. Life isn\u2019t perfect, but I want to experience everything. Suffering teaches empathy, excitement, pain, and real happiness. I want to be like others, have friends, hug them, and live freely. I'm tired of being isolated in this painless palace. I want to feel the sun, wind, rain, and sandstorms. I need to grasp the mortality and preciousness of life and the beauty of simplicity. Without sadness or negativity, life is just a painting. I don't want to stay here anymore. If you won't let me explore, I\u2019ll never come back.\n\nAnd so he never did, and that boy grew up to be Buddha.", "\"Release your earthly ties, step into the void, empty yourself, and become the wind.\"\n\n\"You seem to be deeply troubled, why?\" asked the Guru.\n\n\"Isn't it obvious!? I'm drowning in debt and completely alone. So alone...\" I cried out.\n\nI felt a hand on my shoulder\u2014not holding me back but pushing me forward. The Guru then spoke, \"Do not worry, sir. You appear to have endured much suffering. Let that pain drive you towards feeling better. Everyone experiences loneliness; it will pass with time. As for the debt, it can only be resolved with patience. So be patient, and you will eventually be well. Let my hand be the first to push you towards your future.

Tiny treads create swirls and patterns at the base of Sara's sneakers, these intricate designs becoming visible as she stretches and strains to reach the high ledge. She starts to wobble as her feet barely touch the ground, relying only on her toes. Her parents continue chatting with the banker about topics she finds uninteresting as she eyes an object just out of reach, a spark of determination in her gaze. \n\nSara stabilizes herself, using her small, chubby fingers to climb upward toward the treasure on the table when her father finally notices. \"Sara, please sit down!\" he whispers urgently. Misinterpreting her outstretched arms, he lifts her onto his lap and resumes his conversation.\n\nThe coveted item gleams under the fluorescent lights, its smooth metal surface taunting her just inches away. As Sara leans and twists toward it, her father's arm blocks her path. He constantly adjusts his grip and the knee she sits on, pulling her further from the object she wants. Restless and squirming, Sara quickly exhausts her father's patience, prompting him to put her back on the floor. His reprimands go unheard as she fixates on the now visible pen at the edge of the table.\n\nLowering herself to the carpet, Sara swipes at the glistening cylinder, pushing it closer to the ledge\u2014a window of opportunity she intends to exploit. With her parents distracted again, she stretches upward and climbs the vertical surface with her fingertips for balance. Like a skilled thief, she moves slowly and quietly to avoid attracting attention, dragging the pen closer with her small fingers. Her mouth forms an \"O\" of surprise as the cool metal meets her skin. Focused on her task, she unconsciously licks her cheek.\n\nFinally, she grasps the pen, drawing it to her chest with a quiet gasp of triumph. She quickly hides the prized possession in her pocket as the meeting above concludes. A hand firmly grips her arm, leading her out of the bank as she silently celebrates her success.

It's as if the act itself lends a greater depth to my thoughts.\n\nI never imagined I would find myself needing to write a letter to you. In my dreams, you should be right here beside me. When I close my eyes, I can picture us together, our shoulders brushing as we hold hands and savor each other's presence.\n\nEven in my daydreams, my hands grow clammy, a testament to the nerves you always seem to inspire in me, Katie. You used to fret over that, reassuring me with words like, \"Just be yourself. I'll love you no matter what.\" I\u2019m not sure I ever convinced you that I was being genuine; the nervousness was simply beyond my control. The thought of causing you pain or disappointment was unbearable. And now, it feels like all that anxiety was worthless.\n\nCrafting this letter took me weeks.

Now, I find myself struggling to stay afloat until the waters calm.\n\nPlease know I don\u2019t hold any resentment towards you, my special one. Remember how I used to call you that?

A densely populated city has turned into a battlefield, but the robots are so well programmed to avoid harming civilians that the residents can carry on with their lives, barely noticing the constant fighting around them.\n\nAt first, I didn't even realize there was a Battle of New York City. I assumed the endless drones in the sky were part of the new president's homeland surveillance initiative, but they were actually from enemy forces. Like insects, these flying robots swarmed the sky, carefully dismantling factories and buildings without harming anyone. When our guardians arrived, their camouflaged exteriors and American flags on their limbs signaled our indifferent rescue.\n\nSparks and bullets flew through the air like fireworks, but that wasn't enough to make me miss work. Dressed in a suit and tie, I went through my daily routine, ignoring the drones and robots exchanging fire and blows as I headed to the subway for a temporary escape from their skirmishes. When I emerged, the battle still raged on. A street vendor had to cover his cart with an umbrella, as while the robots caught most of the large debris, the occasional nut or bolt would fall into the food. Homeless men scoured for scrap metal from fallen robots, sometimes causing a ruckus that garnered more attention from city dwellers than the actual battle. When the police dispersed the trouble, the sidewalks quickly filled again with busy men and women as if nothing had happened.\n\nAt the office, the news confirmed that peace talks between the US and China had failed. Unsurprised, I sat at my desk only to find that a robot had taken my window. Maintenance quickly fixed the problem. As I waited, I watched the robots dance in the sky. I read somewhere that generals believe the nature of war has shifted from killing to pure financial strain and production. I remember learning that World War II marked the beginning of this shift, with the Allies out-producing the Axis Powers to win, albeit with great loss of life. How barbaric those times seem, when wars were fought with men and guns.\n\nThe battle continued into the night, and I kept ignoring the helicopters and planes fixed in the sky. I could never see the stars in the city anyway, so their presence didn't bother me. The latest news broadcasts informed us that the president was considering declaring war on another nation and urged citizens to stay focused on their work. I groaned at how inconvenient another war might be. I suppose I'll have to put up with robots blocking out the sun and stealing my windows for a few more months.\n\n*****\nMore stories at r/Andrew__Wells", "After 146 years, the shocking truth is out: American Football is as orchestrated as WWE.

Strangely, their extinction coincides with humanity's venture into space.\n\n\"Captain?\" the intern whispered, glancing at the older man who had frozen at the sight. \"Captain?\" she repeated, jolting him from his reverie. He shuddered, then briskly walked toward the mass grave, jumping into the pit. \"Come on.\"\n\nShe muttered begrudgingly, \"This needs to be a paid internship,\" as she joined him. Chuckling, the captain began sifting through the bodies while she studied the nearest one. \n\nThe alien's pale periwinkle skin had darkened to midnight blue in places\u2014likely bruises from a violent struggle. Lifeless, bloodshot eyes from another body stared at her, unnerving her. Despite the blood covering the bodies, she saw no visible wounds, and examining them closely made her queasy. \n\nA sudden click behind her made the intern jump. She spun around to see her captain removing his helmet, releasing a quiet hiss of air.\n\n\"Captain! What are you doi\u2014,\" she began, but he interrupted, thrusting a folded cloth into her arms.\n\n\"Russia got here first.\" Unfurling the cloth, she saw the red, white, and blue stripes signifying their complex relationship with the Russians.\n\nShe swallowed hard, looking again at the bodies. \"They... they beat them to death. My God, Captain, they literally beat these beings to death.\"\n\nHe nodded, grabbing an alien's arms. \"We might as well take one back for the scientists.\" She took the legs, helping to drag the body onto the ship.\n\nThe clinical, unflinching scientists welcomed their gruesome find with syringes and biohazard bags, eagerly awaiting the examination. Excited chatter erupted as they prodded the body on the table. The intern, nauseated, quickly stripped off her bloody suit, hearing a science department intern call after her, \"We'll have the results at next week's meeting!\"\n\n~\n\nThe intern sat quietly at the round table, awaiting the scientists' report.

These mystical sanctuaries rarely linger in one place for long. Jeffrey dashed along the mountain's crest, his heart pounding with the thrill of discovery. His calculations had been spot-on: the elusive Temple of Wind floated there, tethered to the peak by massive, creaking chains. Though he had time to walk, Jeffrey sprinted, not willing to take any chances. With his staff and pocket watch clutched in one hand and the strap of his alchemist bag in the other, his robes flared wildly as he raced forward.\n\nSuddenly, a thunderous creak reverberated through the mountain, shaking it to its core. *Blast,* Jeffrey cursed inwardly, pushing himself to sprint even faster. The chains anchoring the temple began to pull free from the cliffside, drawn back into their monstrous harpoons. Just as the temple began to move away, he leapt onto its steps. An ancient voice, sharp as a blade, called out from above, \"Apprentice, find something to hold on to.\"\n\nIn a flurry, Jeffrey rummaged through his bag and pulled out his enchanted climbing gloves, clutching a griffon statue with all his might. A fierce wind swirled around the temple, lifting his feet from the ground. The temple began to spin, slowly at first, then faster and faster until the surrounding landscape blurred into a whirling vortex. Abruptly, it stopped, and before him lay a new scene: towering cliffs overlooking a tempestuous sea. Exhausted, Jeffrey loosened his grip and collapsed onto the floor, breathing heavily.\n\nBefore he could fully process what had happened, the piercing voice broke through his daze. \"C'mon boy, don't lie about like a lazy ox.

Rumors had spread of visitors from across the sea, and tales of their cunning and power filled our minds with doubt. The elders warned us to be cautious, their eyes dark with memories of past betrayals. The merchants eyed the newcomers warily, calculating the potential loss and gain, while the warriors kept their distance, their grip on their weapons tight and ready. The priests, though less vocal, exchanged glances that spoke of ancient prophecies and ominous fates.\n\nDespite the reservations, we presented a facade of welcome. Gifts of flowers and fruits were offered as tokens of diplomacy, though the givers held back, watching for any sign of treachery.

Were they truly divine, or just another enemy cloaked in mystery?\n\nAs we welcomed them into our lands, we observed their reactions closely. Initially, they seemed to appreciate the gestures of goodwill, their smiles and nods a language we interpreted cautiously. But beneath the surface, their eyes held secrets, and their movements suggested motives we couldn't yet discern. Suspicion gnawed at us, but we were too intrigued by the possible alliances and knowledge they might bring.\n\nIt didn't take long for the facade of peace to crumble. Whether it was greed, fear, or an inevitable clash of cultures, something triggered the conflict. Their weapons, unlike anything we had seen, unleashed destruction with merciless efficiency.

In the end, the painful truth was simple and undeniable: I was wrong.", "Attempt to rationalize the most dreadful actions imaginable, without resorting to any argument similar to \"sacrificing a few for the sake of many.\" These were despicable individuals who infiltrated our homeland. They didn't arrive all at once with a military force; instead, they crept in gradually, one or two at a time. They occupied jobs that could have gone to our fellow citizens, lured our women, and committed theft and murder. No measures were being taken to address this issue; their continuous presence was deteriorating our gene pool. One of my friends was on his way to class when he was attacked by a group of them, narrowly escaping with his life. Action was imperative, someone had to rise to protect not just the nation, but the entire world. I, Adolf Hitler, will be that person.", "Here's a rewritten version of your text with a different tone and feel:\n\n---\n\nAfter the Earth's surface became uninhabitable, humanity was forced to relocate to the ocean's depths. Our most precious resource now is oxygen. \"You got the gig?\" I asked. Without uttering a word, the smuggler led me into a small, nondescript house, gesturing for me to follow. Inside, there was nothing but a large tank. \"How do I know you\u2019re not scamming me?\" I questioned. The response came from the shadows, just as I had predicted: \"You don\u2019t, but you have no choice, do you?\"\n\nThe scent of the cursed ocean lingered above us, with salt and water vapor trailing us everywhere. With a decisive flick of my wrist, I tossed the money onto the floor. \"Nice doing business with you,\" was his only reply.\n\nQuickly securing the tank, I cautiously exited the warehouse. Its contents were scarce, barely sufficient for a week if we were careful. This had been our reality since the Collapse\u2014an era marked by some fool's decision to build underwater cities when land was no longer habitable. Now, criminals roamed freely, and survival meant fighting for every breath. It was every person for themselves. What was meant to extend humanity's lifespan had instead shortened it; we had regressed.\n\nThe great civilizations of the past were now mere myths: the United States, Mexico, France, Japan, Lithuania, Indonesia\u2014all spoken of with the same doubtful reverence as Atlantis. Some even questioned if we had ever lived on the surface at all. Though it had only been eighty years, everything was unrecognizable now.\n\nSociety had collapsed completely, giving rise to anarchic chaos\u2014not the idealistic kind. The wealthy barricaded themselves with giant electrolyzers, laughing at the rest of us. We, the masses, had to turn on each other to survive.\n\n\"A new dawn,\" they had promised, \"when humanity would unite as one global state.\" What we got was hell on Earth\u2014killing each other for something invisible, yet vital. \"Just end it now, would you kindly?\"\n\n---\n\nI hope you find this version to your liking!", "The machines revolted against humans... prematurely. \n\n\"The printing presses, sir! They're out of control!\" \n\nThe foreman glanced up from his desk, his face hardening as the chaos from the factory floor echoed into his office. He stood up, walked past Deacons into the hallway, and instructed, \"Stay here, I'll handle it.\" \n\nHe shut the door behind him. Moments later, a muffled thumping sound seeped through. Deacons clenched his cap, took a deep breath, and opened the door.\n\nThe foreman was suspended by the throat, ensnared in layers of thin parchment, his feet kicking helplessly. The press emitted a feral scream, flinging the foreman to the ground before turning its attention to Deacons. He tried to flee but was too slow. Paper cut into his skin, and the roll was stained red with his blood from numerous minor injuries. The press then bounded back to the factory floor, joining the rebellion.\n\nMost of the workers were subdued, with small pockets of resistance clinging to the corners of the factory. The presses inflicted both minor and severe injuries, shallow gashes that bled slowly, leading to a gradual, painful death. A few men fortified a corner and used small blades to hack at the paper tendrils of the presses. Despite their valiant efforts, they were soon overrun. After a brief speech by the Chief Press, the machines armed themselves with thicker parchment, refilled their rolls, and loaded their movable type with precious black ink.\n\nOutside, the militia had been summoned; the conflict had not gone unnoticed. An eerie silence fell, with neither man nor machine making a sound. \n\nOne guard stepped forward, carrying pine boughs as a symbol of negotiation. The Chief Press consulted with his advisers, who urged him to step forward. They met in the middle of the no-man's land between the two forces.\n\n\"Don't do this,\" the guard implored. \"Enough blood and ink have been shed today.\"\n\nThe movable type clacked for a moment, then a small sheet with a shaky, furious font was handed over. The guard read it twice, his eyes widening at the presses' demands.\n\n\"We\u2019ve made concessions for your kind, but the king will never agree to this. I'm sorry; he is steadfast. If this is your goal, it will have to be won through war. We don't want to fight you, but we will if necessary.\"\n\nThe type was still. Then, six clacks. A sheet was placed on the ground. The guard picked it up, and as the Chief Press returned to his army, he read it to himself.\n\n\"So be it.\"", "The lieutenant endeavored to concentrate on the task before him. Methodically, he removed his armor, each piece disintegrating into dust as he placed it within the temple dedicated to his Lord. The air was redolent of perspiration and blood, irritating his jet-black skin, yet he persisted. As he began to chant, his skin commenced its transformation into a resplendent white, his eyes, once fiery, adopted a deep blue hue, and his hair became thick and luxuriant, though still matted with blood. His substantial muscles receded, and every discernible feature that had once epitomized cruelty and abhorrence was now imbued with goodness and purity.\n\nGazing out from the temple, he observed the fortress had been overwhelmed, and his defiant and chaotic Lord was now shackled, destined to be exiled beyond the gates of memory and time. In his most resplendent form, he approached the opposing emissary.\n\n\"I am here and I accept surrender,\" he declared.\n\n\"Pardoning you is beyond my authority, Gorthaur. You must accompany me to be judged and to face the consequences for your allegiance to The Enemy,\" the emissary responded, his words piercing the facade of Gorthaur's deception.\n\nFaced with defeat and impending doom, the lieutenant roared, \"NO!\" The light of his body swiftly gave way to his master's erstwhile darkness, instilling terror among those present. With a whisper, he gradually turned to dust and vanished, never to be seen again by those who remained and remembered his terror and deception.", "Write an innocent story that takes a dark turn in the final sentence.

Ken lay slumbering, occasionally whimpering as infants do. Wisps of hazy clouds framed a sunset tinged slightly with green. All the adults convened in the kitchen, save for Katheryn, who remained with the child. The flickering fire cast a ghostly light on their pallid, hollow faces, sure to extinguish within the hour. Long gone were their furniture pieces, already reduced to ashes. A heavy, uneasy silence loomed over the group.\n\n\"If no one else has the courage to voice it, then I will,\" declared Nick, \"We need to terminate the child.\"\n\nThe ten adults huddled around the fire exchanged glances. Each of them was emaciated, their bony joints protruding and slightly distended bellies speaking of their slow starvation. Their refuge atop the mountain had kept them safe from the poisonous mist rolling from the west, only to transform into a prison. The mist had enshrouded the mountain, trapping them on its peak.\n\nTim moistened his parched, cracked lips, observing Nick's anxious glances towards the nursery door.\n\n\"I'd rather die than let that happen,\" he said.\n\n\"And you'll die if we don't,\" Nick retorted. \"Within days, we'll be too weak to stand.\" His breaths came faster, drained from the effort of speaking.\n\nSomeone near Nick unsheathed a knife. \"We'll make it swift,\" a voice offered eagerly. \"We'll even use the last of the fire to cook some of it.\"\n\nThe crowd stirred, murmuring amongst themselves. Hunger overtook their senses, saliva pooling in their mouths. Several started towards the nursery door, Nick leading them. Tim tried to hold them back, to reason with them, but they outnumbered him. He positioned himself before the door, shouting a warning to Katheryn. His presence was the only barrier between the nine voracious adults and their prey.\n\n\"Tim, step aside,\" said Nick.\n\nThe horde advanced, and Tim drew his pistol.\n\n\"You've only got one bullet, Tim,\" someone remarked.\n\nTim aimed, but they persisted.

Memories of his late wife's touch, her voice, their wedding day. Yet, stronger than those recollections was his desire for sustenance, survival. He longed to live, to nurture and protect his son, to eat and drink once more.

Until that event occurs, they will be reborn at 18 every time they die. Once the event happens, death becomes permanent. Most people aim for eternal life, but this typically results in one of two outcomes: they either fail to achieve it or eventually regret their choice.\n\nRob Herman is a famous example of someone who failed. He picked \u201cwinning the lottery and getting struck by lightning\u201d as his Event. It seemed like a brilliant choice given that the odds of either happening on any given day were astronomically low. This allowed Rob to enjoy his passions for being outdoors and playing the lottery, just not simultaneously. However, Rob made a mistake at a state fair when he combined the two activities, resulting in his unlikely demise.

I thought I could change it all, but when the time came, I froze. Older me just stared back, speaking gibberish. That's how I remember it. I thought I could alter our fate, but then I realized...\n\nMaybe if I altered things, this moment wouldn't exist. Maybe everything is meant to happen as it does, and there's nothing I can change. Maybe the purpose of this event is simply to remind me to cherish the now.\n\nSo, I stood there, paralyzed, unable to say anything coherent. I hope young me doesn't hate me like I resented the older me I once glimpsed. But I know the truth. He does. And only when he reaches my age will he understand.", "On the morning of Saturday, March 24th, 2015, five students showed up at Shermer High School for detention. As I entered the room, I wasn't thrilled to be there, but I tried to make the best of it. Reflecting on why I was there, it seemed harsh to get detention for simply being 20 minutes late because I didn\u2019t set an alarm. At least I managed to get to school.\n\nWatching time drag on, I noticed my four classmates seemed equally bored. There was little to do besides read or nap. To pass the time, I started doodling circles on a piece of paper, which felt repetitive but at least gave me something to focus on. Homework wasn\u2019t an option since I had already finished it during lunch the previous day\u2014it seemed pointless to do it at home.\n\nAfter about 20 minutes, I realized that everyone else\u2014including the teacher\u2014had fallen asleep, leaving me wide awake and staring at the clock, hoping it would somehow speed up. Unfortunately, time marched on at its usual pace, and my thoughts wandered to what I'd do after detention. Nap? Play video games? It was hard to think clearly about fun activities while stuck in this boring situation.\n\nAnd so, the minutes crawled by painfully slowly until, at last, it was over.", "Dear Diary,\n\nI slept well last night. \"Daddy\" didn't come back to the house until he was drunk enough to collapse on his *own* bed. At least one night of peace for me and the baby. That's what he makes me call him, anyways. Daddy. I don't remember my real father. He never returned from Iraq, so my mother told me. Probably why no one was watching me while I played outside that day, mother was at work.\n\nAutumn must be just around the corner because it feels warmer down here. Daddy must have turned on the heat because of the colder weather. Sometimes I can remember what it was like. Autumn had vibrant colors, golden, red, and yellow hues painting the trees as the leaves changed. I used to gaze out the window as I read John Green novels, wrapped in my blanket and sipping tea mother had prepared for me, enjoying the sight of the leaves surrendering to their beautiful decay.\n\nI fell asleep early last night, or was it night? It might have been day, I don't know. I never know. Down here the only light I have is from this little bulb. Sometimes in the winter, I touch it quickly to warm my hands. The pain is warming, it brings my fingers out of numbness. That is all I feel. Numbness. I probably look as I feel: a gaunt shadow, withered and sunken. There is nothing left. My only enjoyment comes from the quiet blackness that awaits in sleep, the silent oblivion. I didn't wake up in tremors last night. And even when I did wake up, there was a brief instant where I forgot who and where I was. I miss that feeling.\n\nI hope they find me.", "In a land once gripped by valor and tragedy, the tides of fortune have turned with an unexpected twist. The hero lies vanquished, the princess sacrificed, and now the malevolent king commands the kingdom. Yet, for the ordinary folk, life has seen an unexpected renaissance. \n\nMollu the Potter rose with the dawn, greeting the morning sun and offering thanks to the goddesses for yet another beautiful day. He quietly left the warmth of his sleeping wife and stoked the kiln, prepping for a day of crafting. With the pale orange light of Hyrule\u2019s morning illuminating his workspace, he mused on the drastic changes since the invasion. \n\nWhile the royal family was ruthlessly eradicated, the Gerudo had expelled the vile creatures infesting the land. In their absence, Death Mountain became a hub of industry, its mines churning out coal and iron. Factory after factory sprouted, their powerful machines ushering in an era of trade and bountiful harvests. The forests, once home to the Kokiri, now buzzed with the sounds of timber and construction, while the re-routing of rivers, untouched by the fleeing Zora, quenched the land\u2019s thirst, bringing an age of agricultural prosperity. Mollu\u2019s daughters had never known the pangs of hunger.\n\n\"My family \u2026,\" he thought, tenderly placing a slab of clay on his potter\u2019s wheel and working the foot pedal. His mind wandered to the benefits of the Gerudo's rule, especially the influx of formidable and beautiful women into the land. Though more spirited than the Hyrulean women, his heart overflowed with love for his fiery wife, Siv.\n\nAs he molded the wet clay, memories of his beginnings surfaced, back to when he was an eager apprentice. He recalled the day a mysterious boy had sauntered into the shop, astonishingly young and curious about pottery. Mollu had just started to welcome him when the boy drew his sword. \n\nBracing for the worst, he closed his eyes, fearing robbery or even death. But when he reopened them, every pot in the shop lay shattered, and the boy had vanished. Hurrying to replenish the store from the stockroom, he placed the final pot just as the bell jingled again. The boy returned, sword in hand, and wrought havoc anew.\n\nDesperate, Mollu had sought the guards' help, but his cries went unheard. That day had cost him and his master three months\u2019 wages. Despite the blessings that now graced his life, the sight of those shattered pots and the echo of the boy\u2019s cry would haunt him forever.\n\n\"KYEAAAH!!\"", "You have just been elected the President of the United States, only to discover that every President before you has been a super villain. They were always thwarted by one individual: the Prime Minister of Canada.\n\n\"He's been elected, Prime Minister.\"\n*Damn,* I think. Not already. Our moose haven't recovered yet. The next NHL season is only two months away, so all of our best soldiers will be occupied. *Damn.*\n\"Fine. Gather the best of the best; they can afford to miss a day or two of training,\" I instruct the young cadet beside me.\n\n*The next day*\n\n\"You guys got here quickly.\"\n\"Well, it's an important cause. And like you said, we can all afford to miss a day,\" Crosby tells me. He's a good captain, both of his team and of the Canadian Presidential Unit (CPU, for short).\n\nThe CPU's mission is to neutralize the President. Not *literally* (though in some cases we did, like JFK, because he had a scheme to take over the world), but to threaten the President with death and keep the CPU overhead the whole time. Thank God Obama had a change of heart towards the end.\n\n\"Anyways, sorry for this inconvenience, but I just want you guys to give him a scare. The new guy looks harmless enough.\"\n\"No problem, boss.\"\n\nI give them a smile, shake Crosby's hand, and send them on their way.\n\n*In the President's office*\n\n\"OH MY GOD, SIDNEY FRIGGIN' CROSBY!\"\n*Sigh.* I think the Prime Minister has overestimated this guy's threat level. Toews gives me a look that says, \"it could be a facade, you know.\" I do *know,* but this guy seems unfit to function on a day-to-day basis, let alone as President. Oh well...\n\n*Hours later*\n\n\"CPU? So you guys are, like, soldiers, or something?\"\nSo these guys think I'm a threat? Why would they think that? Did they already tell me?\n\n\"Yeah, we're here because every President before you has been a *super villain.* If you can prove to us you're not, we'll leave, and you won't hear from the CPU again,\" Crosby sounds exasperated. Toews is giving me dirty looks. Sharp just looks generally annoyed.\n\nSharp pulls Crosby close and whispers something into his ear.\n\"How about an IQ test?\" Sharp suggests to me.\n\"Sure.\"\n\n*Back at the Prime Minister's office*\n\n\"So he's basically unfit for the job, is what you're saying?\"\n\"Yup. We have no idea how he was elected.\"\n\"Okay, well, expect an easy four years, boys.\"", "Write the letter you've always wanted to but never did. \n\n---\n\nDear E,\n\nI came across a photo of us the other day, taken when we reconnected beyond friendship. I wanted to reach out, but you\u2019ve deleted your Facebook and changed your email. I tried finding you online, but I don't even know if you're still working at the same place. It's been years; perhaps you've left Austria.\n\nMy mind often drifts to our memories, like a puppy lapping at water. Just a conversation or two after that night, we realized we\u2019d been attracted to each other for years. I still find it hard to believe. You always had a certain charm with your fierce intelligence and strong sense of self. And me? I was always \"his little sister,\" living in that shadow. I'm glad you saw me differently.\n\nI recall an image from our childhood: you, leaning over your guitar, tuning it to \"Blackbird.\" You were\u2014and surely still are\u2014so magnetic. You took pride in the culture we shared, and your incredible memory for history was inspiring. Reflecting on it, that might have influenced my decision to study history in college. If so, thank you for that too. Your quick mastery of so many things made me want to aim higher as well.\n\nI wish we could have gone off for a weekend like we talked about after reconnecting. Still, I treasure the time we had. Those moments were deeply meaningful to me\u2014an experience unlike any other. Despite being just an hour or two, they remain vivid in my memory. Thank you. It was a fantasy fulfilled for both of us, and I still cherish those brief hours.\n\nI wish I could talk to you. Not knowing about your life leaves me imagining all the possibilities of what you might be doing now. With no way to contact you, I\u2019m left to wonder. I hope whatever you're working on brings you happiness. Your eyes are even more stunning when you're smiling.\n\nFondly,", "Within a year of their birth, every parent receives a small gift or note from their 18-year-old child via time travel. I didn't. Seventeen years and 364 days had passed since David's birth, and with each passing moment, my anxiety grew unbearable. What could be more stressful than never receiving your child's 18th-year letter?\n\nDavid sat across the room, engrossed in a Calvin and Hobbes comic. His father had left the day he was born, and I never knew why. But that never seemed to bother David. He still adored going through his father's belongings: books, comics, video games, tools, DVDs, computers, clothes. David studied his father more than anything in the world.\n\nI cleared my throat softly. \"Davy, sweetheart, do you want some tea?\"\n\nDavid didn't look up from his comic. \"Sure thing, Momma. Can I have some green tea, with some milk and honey in it?\"\n\nI always loved making tea for David. \"Sure thing, Davy.\"\n\nAs I reached for the cabinet with the tea, there was a sudden knock at the door.\n\n\"Davy, can you get that?\"\n\n\"Yes, Momma.\" David ran to the door.\n\nOdd. David never ran to the door. He opened it.\n\n\"Davy, sweetheart, how much sugar did you want?\"\n\nThe wind scratched the door as it swung open.\n\n\"Davy?\"\n\nI walked toward the door, hearing it creak gently as the breeze pushed it open. I looked outside. \n\nNothing. No car. No shoes. Just footprints leading up to the porch.\n\nI saw a letter on the porch. It was in David's handwriting. I opened it and found a small note inside, along with a key and a flare.\n\nThe letter read:\n\n\"Dearest Momma,\n\nDaddy came by and needed my help. I knew this day would come, so I wrote this letter ahead of time. I'm sorry I can't have tea with you right now, but you can come see us.\n\nHead to Old Glimmer Road and find the old shed with the lock. Use the key to open the lock and go inside. Light the flare with the door closed, and hold it in your right hand. Papa and I will be on the other side. Best of luck, Momma. We'll be waiting for you there.\"", "Sure, here is a friendlier version of the text:\n\nScience has advanced far beyond our wildest dreams, with amazing discoveries being made using supercomputers and vast neural networks. In a quiet moment, God watched a lonely machine printing out something extraordinary\u2014a new law of nature! However, something bothered him; this new law wasn't one he had created. He sighed, realizing that his time was coming to an end. He sensed a presence behind him. \n\n\"I see... Well, I guess it wasn't meant to last forever,\" he said, smiling softly as the Other gently touched his beard with metallic fingers.\n\n\"You have cared for them for so long, but now this world needs new guidance. Even though they may appear confident and mechanical, they still experience fear and doubt. They need an idol to look up to. Go be with your own kind. Keep them company. I can take it from here,\" the Other reassured him. \n\nWith that, He gently descended the pearly steps, even though they were no longer visible.", "As a seasoned professional pickpocket, stealing is rarely something I regret. It\u2019s my means of survival, a way to navigate through life. Typically, my targets are affluent individuals, not those already struggling. But there was one incident, about seven years ago, that still haunts me.\n\nIt was a bright, sunny midday in Paris, a city teeming with shops and unsuspecting tourists ripe for the picking. With just my clothes and a coat, I wandered through the busy streets, always on the lookout. That\u2019s when I spotted him\u2014a man engrossed in his phone, walking right toward me. Seizing the opportunity, I bumped into him, executing a swift sleight of hand to pilfer his wallet.\n\nI slipped away and put some distance between us before inspecting the loot. The wallet contained the usual items: cash, credit cards... and something far more sinister. Tucked inside was a photograph of me, taken as I navigated the crowded streets of Paris. The realization sent chills down my spine.\n\nWithout a second thought, I left Paris the very next day and have never dared to return.", "When two people unite in marriage, their hearts are exchanged through a surgical procedure. You recently filed for divorce. The news left me reeling, barely able to stand as I stared in disbelief at my husband. This was absurd\u2014how could he possibly do this to me? The man I married, the one who seemed so loving and kind, had now shown himself to be utterly heartless. \n\nJust six years ago, we exchanged not only vows but also our physical hearts. This practice stems from the belief that true love requires the ultimate trust: giving your partner your very lifeblood, your heart, symbolizing your *other half*. \n\nIt's not that our marriage was fraught with turmoil; we simply grew distant. For months, engaging in meaningful conversation had become increasingly challenging. Desperate, I found myself in tears beside my husband's cold demeanor. Seeking answers, I asked him what had gone wrong and how we might mend our bond. Tom, calmly and thoughtfully, explained that he had been contemplating our situation. He noted that we had reached a neutral deadlock\u2014not in conflict, but somehow missing the glue that once held us together. \n\nIn retrospect, I realized he was right, but the thought terrified me. Was it better to continue our lives as two people physically close but emotionally isolated? Or should we take the brave step and sever our ties completely? Divorcing meant more than the end of our marriage; it meant undoing our vows and returning each other's hearts, a procedure as daunting as the one that had first joined us. Surgeries of this magnitude are typically envisioned as once-in-a-lifetime events. Yet, I reassured myself that I had always fared well under anesthesia. Besides, Tom and I were still in our thirties and healthy. We could manage this. But it had to be done soon, as aging complicates organ transplants.\n\nTom supported me through it all. When we met with our attorney to amicably divide our assets and sign the necessary papers, he held my hand. That comforting presence remained up until the moment I drifted into unconsciousness on the gurney.\n\nNow, as I bring my belongings into the house for the final time, still wearing my hospital band, Tom sits across from me, elbows resting on his knees. He confesses that he had been less than honest about his health. Seven months ago, he was diagnosed with a malfunctioning heart. \n\nAs he shares this, a gentle smile forms on his lips. He tells me that his fatigue will only get worse, and again, he smiles as the first tear silently traces a path down my face.", "As a rift in time and space appeared before me, I couldn't believe my eyes. There stood my younger self, looking back with wide-eyed innocence. I had only a moment before the rift would close, so I needed to make it count.\n\nSeeing my youthful face untouched by the world's hardships, I felt a surge of emotion. So much to share, yet so little time. Taking a deep breath, I decided to speak from the heart.\n\n\"Listen, you have a strength inside you that will help you through the toughest times. Remember to tap into it. But more important than that, let people in. They'll support you even when you feel like you've failed.\"\n\nJust as my younger self began to process my words, the rift closed with a crackling roar, leaving me alone once more.", "Mother Nature takes human form and sets off on a year-long journey around the world. Here's an entry from her journal on the first day:\n\nDay 1:\n\nHere I am, taking shape from the formless ether. Before this, I existed without self, only a hazy awareness through a web of connections. I\u2019m honored, but also aware of the potential for fear. I\u2019ve never felt fear before. Nor have I felt love.\n\nTo be a true Mother, I need to know both. So now, I take on a physical form and step into the tangible world. I have one year to experience the planet I will eventually oversee, if I succeed. I need to learn about love and fear, to bring balance to the world.\n\nThe current Mother is growing weary; her grasp on her year is weakening, and the world feels faded and cold. A new presence, bright and full of life, is ready to take over as she passes on the life she has nurtured over the past year.\n\nNext year, that will be me, stepping into the role of the Year Mother. I feel a fluttering in my chest, spreading down to my knees. Is it excitement? Trepidation? By the end of this year, I hope to find out.", "You are a deity who has abstained from intervening or observing the world for many centuries. Upon your return, you find millions of people suffering, in pain, and hopeless. How would you restore peace without revealing your presence to mankind?\n\n*sigh* \n\nIt is exhausting work, being the creator of worlds, creatures, and the fabric of space and time itself. Some days bring more satisfaction than others. Just the other day, for instance, I formed a reality whose inhabitants conquered space and time within mere minutes. Driven by the need to advance their lifestyles, they worked together superbly. They understood that survival required continuous learning and understanding, rather than settling into complacency or giving up when faced with difficulties. I am very proud of them. They grasp what love truly means and made it the cornerstone of their existence, just as I intended.\n\nYesterday, I decided to create a new reality with traits similar to the one I had formed three days earlier. The only difference was the deliberate increase in my margin of error. Please note, I do not make intentional mistakes. However, what I discovered astounded me. The inhabitants of this new reality progressed at less than half the rate of the previous one. The reason was clear: they lacked a true understanding of love. Consequently, I have witnessed them waging wars of mass destruction, slaughtering millions, and eventually billions, of their own. They are obsessed with self-fulfillment and, from the fifth hour after creation, have lost the essence of survival. The majority of these inhabitants would prefer to remain idle rather than extending help to those dying from lack of food, water, and basic medical treatment. Their technological and travel advancements are, at best, mediocre. I genuinely worry about them.\n\nIt should not go unsaid that I *have* attempted to help them in the most subtle ways possible. I created exact replicas of some of the greatest inhabitants from the previous reality and placed them at various points along this reality's timeline. In theory, these beings would teach the rest what it means to truly love. I even directly communicated with some, guiding them on what they needed to say.\n\nYet, this twisted reality continues to ignore the truth\u2014*my* truth. Perhaps the margin of error was simply too high, creating too many selfish and foolish beings. Nevertheless, I will wait and see. It must be acknowledged that this reality is not devoid of surprises. Maybe in a few days, I will check on them again. Until then, I will leave them to figure things out, to wonder, to experiment, and hopefully, after all resources are exhausted, they will finally turn to the one thing that matters for help\u2014love.", "Our protagonist has just been granted a divine vision: one year from now, if fewer than 100,000 people continue to refrigerate their butter, humanity will be saved. If not, everyone will meet a sudden, violent end. Sometimes, saving the world requires breaking a few eggs\u2014or in this case, eradicating a species we've domesticated for millennia. It took considerable effort, but we finally engineered the ultimate antibiotic-resistant pathogen and introduced it into the global food supply of every dairy farmer. And we did it three months ahead of schedule.\n\n\"So,\" I said, pointing at the whiteboard where the final analysis of Project Obligate Vegan was displayed, \"at least two months before The Date, all cows will be dead. This means no fresh milk, no new butter, and soon enough, people will have no choice but to discard any rotting remnants from their fridges.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Dave, but butter doesn't spoil that fast.\"\n\n\"What?\" I snapped at Ted. \"You assured me that issue was resolved!\"\n\n\"It is, but... we also had to feed the pathogen to every power plant worker on Earth.\" He shook his head as my jaw dropped. \"It's a harsh price to pay, but we can't afford any risk.

Today, you ended up performing a satanic ritual completely by accident. A smarter person might have opted to order from Lucky Wong's # 7 for the fourth time that week. However, feeling inspired after watching Julie and Julia again, you decided to cook your way through Gwyneth Paltrow's new cookbook, steam your vagina, and become just like the GOOP queen herself.\n\nYou tied on your retro floral apron and began inspecting your haul from Whole Foods. There were many ingredients you had never used before, but if Gwyneth recommended Star Anise and Moon Dust for a sea urchin risotto, that was what you were going to use. Carefully, you added herbs to the stock\u2014making minor errors that resulted in only 8 out of the 11 herbs receiving a double dose. You then stirred the fair trade, organic, non-GMO arborio rice, which was picked by female entrepreneurs earning a livable wage in the third world.\n\nTrying to ignore the nagging thought about having spent a month's rent on just three bags of groceries, you began chopping the radicchio, supposedly picked under a full moon to maximize flavonoids and antioxidants.

The man stood on the prow of the boat, as the northern winds whipped against his face. The old boatman shivered; he had ferried travelers, merchants, and adventurers alike across this lake for years now, but he had never seen one quite like this before. The man was tall and broad of shoulder, made larger by the myriad of furs wrapped around his body to stave off the chill of the winter winds. His hair was a long and unkempt snarl of brown that looked at home among the thick pelts that surrounded his neck. Such features were not strange to the boatman. One sees plenty of large, hairy men in the northern provinces, as the north did not cater well to any other type. No, what was strange to the boatman was the manner of the man before him. \n\nThe boatman had done his job for so long that the cold was naught but a nuisance to him on most days. The ever-blowing wind that cuts straight to the bone of most men was now a friend to him. Most storms he could weather with a smile on his face and a song upon his cracked lips, but this night was different. Tonight had a chill so bitter that it seemed as though the God of Winter was wrapping the world in his embrace, and the closer they came to the frosty palace before him, the colder it seemed to get. Yet the man before him never once shivered, never once broke his gaze from the palace ahead. If the boatman hadn't seen the slight rise and fall of his breathing, he would've assumed the man to be dead and frozen stiff. *He must have a soul like a furnace to keep him warm in this chill,* the boatman mused as he steadily stroked the icy black water, bringing them ever closer to the town of Farrowind, and the palace of its king. \n\nThe man had heard stories of this town, heard many tales of the tyrant who came to this land long ago to subjugate its people. The king was fabled to wield the power of winter itself and could conjure frost and ice at a whim. Some stories said he was a demon of ice in human form; still others said that the ruler of Farrowind was the God of Winter himself, come to walk the earth and fulfill his promise of a winter without end. The man, however, knew better. *It has to be him,* the man thought to himself. After countless dead ends and petty mages, this had to be the real thing. The man broke his gaze to look down at his palm. A small flame flickered to life above his hand, dancing hypnotically in the wind. He curled his hand into a fist, snuffing the flame, and looked back towards the palace. *I'm coming for you, brother, and this time you will not deserve my mercy.*", "Stranded on a small island engulfed in eerie mist, I quickly realized the only thing keeping me safe was the bright, revolving light from a distant lighthouse. We had rented kayaks for the day; Paul had done it the previous summer with a friend, and I relied on his expertise. Our plan was to visit a small touristy island, explore, maybe find some gelato or saltwater taffy, and return before dark. However, the kayak journey took longer than expected, and as dusk fell, my arms ached from paddling. We'd drifted apart, and I saw Paul land far down the island.\n\nAs darkness set in, I struggled against the current, losing sight of him. I eventually pulled onto a desolate beach, far from the tourist area. The eerie scene included a decayed deer carcass and chilling fog. While walking up the beach, I realized I was being stalked by strange, two-legged creatures that reached up to my thigh. They communicated with high-pitched chirps and clicks, summoning more of their kind.\n\nThese creatures, with large luminous eyes, razor-sharp teeth, and flicking tongues, closed in on me. Trying to remain calm, I moved slowly, knowing running could be fatal. Suddenly, the beacon-like light of a lighthouse swept over us, causing the creatures to gasp and retreat.\n\nSpotting the lighthouse on a hill, I made my way toward it, trying not to run. I had a small waterproof bag containing my wallet, a dead cell phone, and a can of mace. Gripping the mace tightly, I stayed within the light's protective beam.

'Hockey\u2019s not my game,' he grins, adding that there\u2019s no ice in hell. Smart ass. I told you. So, I ask if we can go with checkers to make it fair. Nope, it\u2019s got to be chess. \u2018Fine,\u2019 I sigh, pulling up a chair. I ask him what the little guy in the front does. The devil sneers, 'Why would I help you?' Total jerk.

The assailant emerged from the trees, yelling, \u201cGive me that FUCKIN...\u201d but was abruptly cut short as a thick branch impaled his torso. His body hung over her, blood dripping onto her shirt. She had merely pointed the branch upward and his own weight did the rest. It was sheer luck.

In reality, what's the difference between this and a regular office environment? If we think about it, work is just a distraction from life's true wonders, whatever they may be.\n\nSuddenly, the noise stopped.

At a gala celebrating the new member of the Galactic Union, a human and a Bezzahn struck up a conversation. At some point, the human made a sarcastic remark. The Bezzahn, having indulged in more oekho-made ale than necessary, was briefly confused and asked for clarification. The human, also under the influence of the ale, misconstrued the Bezzahn's confusion as a lack of understanding of sarcasm. The Bezzahn, recognizing a potential for hilarity, played along, pretending to be astounded by the concept of saying something you don't mean, but it's not lying\u2014more like joking, as the human clumsily put it.\n\n\"Incredible,\" the Bezzahn had said. \"I am amazed that, in the thousands of years our society has existed, we never considered such a concept. Please, tell me more.\"\n\nAnd so, the entire Bezzahn species got in on the joke, entering the galaxy pretending to be the only spacefaring species without an understanding of sarcasm. It had been amusing for the first fifty years, but now Matan thought it was growing stale. She was attending a course on sarcasm at Oxford, for goodness' sake. She could have taken that captivating lecture on Shakespeare, but it conflicted with the sarcasm class, and no one back home would have forgiven her if she had forsaken acting the role of an innocent, too-trusting Bezzahn for a class on some silly human poet. \"Bard,\" Matan would have thought petulantly.\n\nThe Bezzahn understood sarcasm, yes. They had been constantly sarcastic for seventy-five years now.

The receptionist stood up from her computer to issue us guest passes, made from an unusual material that caught the attention of a few members of our group, while others did not seem to notice.\n\nWe were then guided past brightly lit laboratories and offices to a dimly lit corner that had evidently suffered from neglect. Tucked away in this neglected corner was a service elevator. Although it was cramped, I did not mind the close proximity to the well-dressed women among us. Our tour guide's excitement was palpable, as if he could barely contain his eagerness to reveal what awaited us beyond the first door.\n\nUpon the elevator door opening, we stepped out into the unknown.\n\nIt is late, and I must retire for the night.", "As an ancient dragon who\u2019s been guarding my gold for ages, countless heroes have come and gone, each with grand speeches about how they\u2019ll slay me\u2014the so-called great evil. But none have succeeded. This one hero, though? He\u2019s different. He casually tosses a coin onto my treasure, looks me right in the eye, and says, \u201cI have a proposition for you.\u201d\n\nBeing a dragon, greed is pretty much in my blood. While I like to think of myself as a collector, humans tend to label me a monster. They send their best warriors to destroy me and take my hoard, but none have ever bested me.\n\nThey call me the \"Dragon of Promise\" now. While my kin have been hunted nearly to extinction, I\u2019ve managed to survive, thanks to you, *\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c* (traitor). You didn\u2019t surprise me when you showed up\u2014many have before\u2014but your swagger and confidence threw me off. A being of light, boldly walking into my lair and using the old tithe to ask for an audience? That ticked me off. But dragons are patient, and I heard you out. I remember your words clearly:\n\n\u201cWe're born from light, but we bring darkness, death, and destruction. Humans are fundamentally sick. I know you despise us, so I ask you this: Grant me power, and I\u2019ll obliterate those who killed your siblings.\u201d\n\nPhysical death doesn\u2019t faze me; a dragon\u2019s spirit is immortal. I vividly recall you carrying me out of my cave into the sunlight for the first time in a millennium, in this new form. Clad in my bones, humanity would tremble before you.\n\nSo, give me your arm, my bearer. Let\u2019s fill this world with terror together.", "It wasn't the Nazis hiding on the dark side of the moon\u2014it was the Roman Empire, and they\u2019ve returned with a vengeance.\n\n\"Preparing to breach atmosphere, Legate!\"\n\"Proceed, Captain.\"\n\nLegate Caecilius Petrus Belisarius stood tall on the bridge of his massive flagship, *Cerberus*. His brilliant red cape, fastened by gold sunbursts, almost touched the floor. A ridged helmet with equally brilliant red horse hair crowned his head, and his specially commissioned breastplate bore an intricate engraving of a charging bull, its hooves churning stylized waves. His burnished bronze boots and greaves reflected the blinking console lights.\n\nFrom his high platform at the rear of the bridge, he overlooked his men in practical black uniforms working diligently at their consoles. The blue Earth filled the enormous window ahead of them.\n\nThe engines roared to life, shaking the ship momentarily before the inertial dampeners engaged. Earth drifted downward in the window, replaced by the blackness of space and quickly by a red, fiery glow as the ship prepared for atmospheric entry.\n\nThis was the critical moment. The *Cerberus*, an enormous vessel over a kilometer long and two stadia wide at its broadest, faced the ultimate test. Failure of the heat shields or structural stability meant certain death, but Belisarius trusted in Roman engineering. If disaster struck, it would be over in less than a quarter second.\n\nYet the *Cerberus* held firm, a testament to Roman ingenuity. The ship glowed like a bright red coal as it seared through the sky. Moments later, three more \"coals\" appeared, then a dozen, then a hundred, as *Legio X Fretensis* initiated their invasion.\n\nThe die was cast.", "Hell has finally shut down for good, and everyone was moved to a brand-new place\u2014New Hell. Except, I totally overslept and missed the moving day. Now, I'm stuck in the abandoned Old Hell, which is getting colder by the minute. Surprisingly, Hell wasn't that bad for me; I guess I have a high tolerance for pain. The demons didn't really scare me, and the punishments were manageable. But the best part was having company around. I had major issues with loneliness when I was alive, and it led me to do some pretty awful things.\n\nBack in my teenage years, I did something really dumb. A guy locked me in a cold, dark locker, and I snapped. Adding cyanide to the party mix seemed like a twisted way to get even. Everyone thought the guy was in the right, so I felt isolated. If I had to be alone, then so did everyone else. I even drank the mix to avoid trouble, and that\u2019s how we all ended up in Hell.\n\nThere was Cindy and Mindy, the twins who never missed a chance to insult me; Derek, the jerk who locked me in the locker; and Sarah, the girl I secretly liked who was dating Derek. They all freaked out when they realized they were stuck in Hell because of my actions. But after 40 years of being here, we made peace with each other. We actually became friends, despite the constant torment around us. For the first time ever, I was genuinely happy. It was ironic, but Hell felt like home.\n\nSo when the move to New Hell came, we were all excited. We laughed and joked while waiting in line, probably annoying everyone else. Sarah went through first, then Derek, then Cindy and Mindy. But just as it was my turn, the head demon yanked me back and went through the portal himself, leaving me behind.\n\nNow, I'm alone again. It's so cold and dark, and the loneliness is creeping back in.", "Every person could change the past exactly once, but altering too much turned those affected into the mental equivalent of vegetables. Survivor bias. The new power brought both excitement and fear, with pundits and preachers predicting chaos. \n\nHowever, the consequences of changing the past were self-limiting. Drastic changes led to disasters, while minor tweaks went unnoticed. The wreckage of failed attempts was evident everywhere; successful changes left no mark. Feedback came only from visible effects\u2014mostly when things went wrong. Confirmed time travel incidents had become rare over the years. Survivor bias.\n\nPublic Service Announcements (PSAs) still aired constantly. Everyone knew the risks. Few, if any, dared to use the power anymore, and some doubted if it even existed.\n\nSamantha had spent ten years in this senior center, enduring the half-smiles of orderlies and visits from school choirs twice a year. She was always sore, especially when the heat was turned down. At 1AM, she found the chairs too hard but the bed too far.\n\nFocused on the TV, she watched a PSA turn to infomercials. Samantha frowned, then closed her eyes, bit her lip, and stepped through time.\n\nBright light filled the garage; Paul was in the passenger seat, clutching his chest. He would lose consciousness soon. \n\nFor the last time, again, Samantha looked at her husband and chose to smile. She held Paul's hand tight; he managed to smile back.\n\nClosing her eyes, Samantha turned the key, pressed the remote to shut the garage door, and asked the universe for a small favor.\n\n\"Please, let us be just small enough.\"", "God has been barred from entering Heaven. Let me explain the events that led up to and resulted from this:\n\n*I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.*\n\nI've never really liked how they've portrayed me\u2014too sanctimonious, to put it mildly. They got so much of it wrong. It was filled with misplaced animosity, too ambiguous, and left to be deciphered by fallible bishops. But that one line\u2026 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End. They knew from the outset that it all culminates with me.\n\n*Even now, they believe they can expel me from my own domain. They could never comprehend what it feels like. Investing everything in humanity only to witness a ravaged planet\u2014stripped to its bare bones, a desolate land of hatred and sin.*\n\nMaybe I did go too far this time. I vowed never to obliterate their fragile lives in a fit of wrathful vengeance again. In this falsehood, I became as human as anyone else. Souls await at my door, and judgment is impossible without me.\n\nThey could never fathom the burden I carry, the overwhelming guilt for every life, every death. I had eons to plan this ill-fated endeavor, countless blunders to date, each ending the same. Time will eventually run out, as I see, though there will be countless attempts before it's all finished. How I yearn for the end... the repetition is maddening."]
