["Sorry for not writing for a while, but I've had a pretty busy weekend. I discovered I have around 20 tests on Tuesday because my teachers are cruel...but what can you do? We had marching practice yesterday. It was great because we stayed inside the whole time, and I got to play the second part, making the music portion quite easy.\n\nI left marching early around 5:00 and went out for dinner with my friends, as I had already made plans before knowing about the practice. Dinner was a blast because it was Kelly's birthday, which made it extra special. Afterward, we went to Kelly's place for a sleepover, did a lot of fun activities, and I ended up sleeping earlier than usual since I had to attend a Bar Mitzvah this morning. It was an interesting experience.\n\nFor a project in CR, we need to visit two different places of worship outside our own religion. One visit will be to a Jewish synagogue, and I\u2019m considering a mosque for the other, but I haven't decided yet. This has been my only chance to write, and I actually have to go now, so I'll write more later...maybe.\n\n*Ya di amore*", "Today was alright, despite a late start. I'm not really in the mood to write much, but I might end up writing a lot anyway, as I usually do. There wasn't anything particularly exciting in my classes, and I only chatted with a few close friends, including someone I refer to as \"You know who.\" But actually, you don't know who that is. Not that it matters since no one reads this stuff. I managed to reach the top of the rock climbing wall today. Kelly and I plan to master the entire wall, which should be fun. Jazz was enjoyable as always. So, that's about it. Have a great evening, everyone, I'm heading to bed. (Surprisingly, I didn't write as much as I thought I would.) *Ya di Amore*", "Thought: Alright... I'm totally supportive of little people and everything. I'm not like, \"against little people,\" but honestly, wouldn't it be a bit rude to say, \"Hooray for little people?\" ~Ya di amore~", "So, it\u2019s later in the day and guess what? My parents decided I needed a \u201cconstructive\u201d activity. Yep, you guessed it\u2014cleaning. Ugh, why do parents always think cleaning is the ultimate solution for boredom? It\u2019s beyond annoying. There I was, basking in my peaceful, homework-free zone while soaking in some smooth jazz when suddenly, \"Hey Catie, go clean.\" Classic, right?\n\nLike always, I did my usual routine of saying, \"Yeah sure, fine, I'll clean.\" Spoiler alert: I almost never do. But this time, my mom came upstairs, asking all nicely with that mom-voice she uses to guilt-trip me. So, I begrudgingly trudged downstairs, grabbed the cleaning supplies, and cleaned the bathroom. Yuck! Cleaning is the absolute worst.\n\nHonestly, I feel like I should just marry a rich guy so I can hire a cleaning lady. Seriously, then I could have a cook who makes me my favorite peanut butter sandwiches all the time. Even if I get super duper fat and the guy wants a divorce, it'll be fine because I won\u2019t have signed a prenuptial agreement. Half of the assets? Yes, please! But first, I\u2019d need to master some witchcraft to make any rich guy\u2014or any guy, really\u2014want to marry me. But now you all know my cunning plan, so back to the drawing board, I guess.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m just scribbling away because I\u2019m not in the mood to chat with anyone. I wish I could go to the park. It's my sanctuary. I take my mini disc player (yeah, old school) and just swing while thinking about life. It\u2019s perfect for alone time, except those little kids who look at me like I'm Frankenstein because a big kid is hogging the swing. They get all antsy because I usually stay there for hours. Honestly, little kids are hilarious.\n\nWell, I\u2019ve probably bored you enough for now. Catch you next time!\n\n~Ya di amore~", "Welcome to my corner of the world, where sarcasm struggles to convey the true irony of my so-called \"horrible life in bubble town.\" Online, it often gets lost in translation\u2014either making me seem awful or deadly serious. \n\nHowever, today's Monday surprised me in a good way. After a decent night's sleep and actually completing my homework, I endured the bus ride to school. At least I got to sit alone, which is my rare, precious \"alone time.\" Plus, my trumpet demanded extra space.\n\nUpon arrival, I made my usual greetings. Brandon seemed better, though his story involving ceramics was less polite\u2014let\u2019s leave it at that. Carson checked on the new mitten policy that's got her riled up, and we saw a few friends, including cute Jake and some Speech Team members. The missing six-minute bell made me late for Wind Ensemble, but that's just part of the chaos with my trumpet section. We faced a scolding from A when sectionals turned into a free-for-all. I endured playing my dreadful music theory composition, relieved to get it over with. Mrs. Kane\u2019s usual lit analysis paper critique spared us from F\u2019s but not from D's\u2014likely my fate.\n\nGym class brought a highlight with rock climbing, which was thrilling and left me wanting more. The rest of the day was uneventful. With no homework, I'm at a loss for productive activities\u2014go figure. The canceled combo session was a relief given my aversion to soloing, a path we're not even going to explore here.\n\nNow, I'm home, wasting time writing this. More updates might follow if anything notable occurs. Until then, I'm signing off. ~Ya di amore~", "Wow, it resembles Alex quite a bit. You know, the one with the nose that seems to cover their entire face! However, the smiley is far more adorable!", "Guess who's back? Well, kinda. Just killing time before my lesson. Oh, look! A penny! :) So, how was everyone\u2019s day? Ever wonder who actually responds to their computer? I talk to mine. Then again, I also chat with Genevieve, my locker at school. \n\nYou know what irks me? Besides the word \"irks\"? Parentheses! I use them all the time but never seem to get them right. Grr, pooey. It\u2019s like the Tootsie Roll Pop thing: \"The world may never know,\" or in my case, \"Catie may never know because she's clueless.\"\n\nHold on, someone just called, and I totally forgot what I was writing about. Steve phoned about chemistry stuff. He\u2019s such a cool guy, love him (in a friend kind of way). :) And his hair? The coolest. Chemistry, though? Ugh, I loathe it with a burning passion. Okay, maybe not that intense, but it's definitely annoying.\n\nLast night, we had the evening with humanities. Let's not even go there\u2014it was pretty awful. \n\nWeirdly, no homework today and a free afternoon. No jazz practice this week, which is both awesome and a bummer. I love jazz, but free time is nice too. Has anyone noticed how random all this is? Heh, more fun for spontaneous Catie! RAR!\n\nGuess what? No, really, guess! Okay, fine, I'll tell you. I did high ropes yesterday and crossed the swinging balance beam with Peter. Naturally, Mr. Z found something wrong with it. But we did it! \n\nMaybe I should go warm up for my trumpet lesson. Yes? No? That's fun to say. I'm enjoying this random writing, though. Might drop more updates later. You\u2019re fantastic if you made it this far. Or maybe just clueless about the little X in the corner that could have saved you from this madness. *Ya di amore* :o)", "Haven't written in a while due to a busy schedule with Disney and make-up work. Disney was fun, including the bus ride. Being home is nice, though. Learned it's best not to vacation with friends for more than two days as people get edgy. The bus ride was 31 hours. Finally caught up with make-up work. Writing a feature story for journalism on Teenagers VS. Adults, which I'm enjoying. Had a jazz band gig on Wednesday but missed my soli by arriving late. That's about it; off to the mall now. Wish it would snow.", "Haha, just finished dinner! Delicious! I'm feeling so happy right now, and I don't even know why, I just am! I'm chatting with my friends while writing this, which is always fun. Plus, I'm doing homework and watching Law & Order at the same time...how talented am I? Anyway, my day was pretty awesome. No band or music theory classes today, which was great. Kristen and I sat and did homework together and talked about Winter. During the next period, I hung out with Chris and Kelly for a bit (and Alex briefly when he was in Gym) before they started working on music. I tend to feel left out when they do that, so I went to a practice room by myself. Unfortunately, I don't have any good stories for the newspaper. It's a shame people didn't read past the second paragraph of my last story before deciding it was terrible. \n\nEPVM was interesting, and I'm getting nervous about my final. My brother, who got perfect ACT and SAT scores, said it was hard...I\u2019m really scared of that test and feel like I'm going to fail. In Gym...oh my gosh...two words: Commando Crawl. Ouch. That was one of the most painful experiences ever. If you ever do that for high ropes, make sure to wear pants. Trust me, it\u2019s so painful if you don\u2019t. I made it through, though, so it's all good, even if it hurt a lot. \n\nMath was boring, as usual. Random thought: Why do I always write these while talking to Alex? Lunch was interesting; I hung out with Kelly, Emily, and then Chris and Alex. It was cool but nothing special. Comparative Religion was boring with project presentations, and chem was boring too, surprise surprise. Then I came home, did some stuff, and that's the end of my day. So, I shall leave now and...well, I\u2019ll just go. You didn't hear anything from me.", "I got so many compliments on my hair! It was awesome. I got it cut and layered last night, and I really, really like it! It's shorter but still looks great!\n\nRight now, I'm looking for new furniture for my room. I'm completely redoing it, except for the floor because I like having a wood floor. It's easier to clean if you spill something, which happens a lot with me.\n\nSo anyway, just waiting for dinner to be done. Then, I have to study for my science test. Ugh, science... Oh well, we have a late arrival tomorrow! YES! I was hoping for one, and I was upset because I thought we didn't have it, but then Bryan (with a y) was like, \"yeah, Norkus, you idiot!\" Ouch... Oh well, it's hard to be sad with a late arrival!\n\nExcept finals are next week, and I'm not ready at all. I should probably actually study this time, considering I haven\u2019t studied for finals since high school started. Surprisingly though, I've done well. I don't get it. If I could just learn not to avoid homework, I'd be doing great. For most kids, tests are the problem; for me, it's the homework.\n\nYay! Dinner is ready. I'll write more later!", "Avoiding homework yet again is becoming a bad habit. However, I just painted my nails, and typing is actually something I can do without messing them up. I promise I'll get back to homework soon. On a brighter note, today was fantastic! I saw *HIM* four times, and it was amazing. He even noticed and spoke to me twice out of the three times I approached him. It's exciting!\n\nSchool wasn't bad either. This morning, I chose to sit with my best friends instead of waiting outside the band room. I hadn't realized how much I missed spending time with them. Kathryn is doing well, busy working on her paper, and of course, Joanne and John were flirting. They make such a wonderful couple, and I do feel a bit envious at times. It would be nice to have someone like that in my life. I'm still deciding if I want to ask someone to the Winter dance. I would love to go, but I'm unsure who to ask. Definitely not *HIM*. Perhaps I'll just go with a friend, and everything will be fine.\n\nKelly S. was her usual cool self, even though she was complaining about stuff. I love her to death regardless. Band class was different today since Peter was absent, which meant less teasing. Surprisingly, it felt a bit unsettling; I guess I've grown accustomed to the daily banter. Music theory was alright, but I'm seriously considering dropping the class. I don't feel like I'm learning much or enjoying it, and my time could be better spent elsewhere. Kelly Coyle wasn't too happy about it, but I have to do what's best for me.\n\nEPVM was as boring as usual, especially with a substitute teacher. Gym, however, was thrilling! I went on the high ropes course and was terrified yet exhilarated. Mehgan and I did great, completing three courses today despite Allen's antics wasting some time. My watch falling off was a scare, but everything turned out fine. There was some tension with Kelly and Erica, but I hope no one's upset with me. I really dislike having people mad at me.\n\nMath was challenging, but I've finally figured out the key to understanding the teacher's methods. He's actually a good teacher if you can stay awake in his class. Anyway, I have to go now\u2014time for a haircut! I'll write more later.", "Welp... haha, what a funny word, perhaps because it isn\u2019t a real word! Anyway, I just finished my paper a bit ago, and now my mom is correcting it. Gulp! I feel like I\u2019ve forgotten how to write normally thanks to Mrs. Kane's emphasis on journalistic style. It\u2019s difficult for me to stop thinking, \"Is that objective?\" Argh, so annoying!\n\nI just vented to Bryan about jazz. I'm really trying to forgive Alstadt, but it still bothers me a lot that he never asked, consulted, or even told me! Still, forgiveness is the right thing to do, so that\u2019s what I will strive for. \n\nThis weekend has actually been pretty cool. I'm feeling a lot better. I spent the whole weekend reading\u2014three really good books. I also watched Pretty Woman last night. It was so cute that it almost makes me want to become a prostitute in search of love... but not really. \n\n\u201cLove is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking. It is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.\u201d - 1 Corinthians 13:4-8. \n\nI love that passage; it\u2019s so great and true. I also came across another fantastic quote today, though it\u2019s not from the Bible. Dr. Seuss said, \u201cBe who you are and say what you feel, for those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind.\u201d Again, so great and so true.\n\nAnyway, I must go finish my conversation with Bryan and then off to bed. Ahh, sleep, I love you! :)", "I'm currently avoiding homework and chatting with Brandon. I'm really nervous about the upcoming jazz competition. Although I don't have any solo parts in the songs we're playing, \"Jumpin' at the Westside\" is still making me anxious. I just know I'm going to freak out. Anyway, I've been really unwell for the past week. First, it was a cold, then an ear infection\u2014just one illness after another. I'm so tired of being sick. I'll come back and write more after I finish my paper. I'm determined to get it done. Talk to you later.", "RAR! (Sorry, just love typing that!) I'm currently working on my music theory final\u2014last minute, of course. Rock on! Had jazz today and I\u2019m doing better. When called upon, I didn\u2019t panic or refuse to participate. No real finals today, just a tough band final and a Comparative Religion class without a final\u2014yay! The rest of the day has been uneventful. I'll write more if anything interesting happens, but I doubt it!", "I decided not to go. I talked to Chris about what was bothering me, and it really helped. I love that kid; he's great to talk to when you're upset. I didn't want to tell him at first, but he made me, and I'm glad he did. It felt good to get it out. I cried for the first time in a long time, maybe since my Grandma's funeral. I miss her a lot. I think I need to cry or get upset more often because holding it in hurts more when it all comes out at once. I really want someone to like me for who I am. I don't understand why no one does. I'm not the best looking, but I'm not the worst, and I try to be a good person. It feels like no one appreciates my efforts. I'll be fine tomorrow. Writing and talking to people I trust helps, even if no one reads this. Anyway, off to bed. Goodnight.", "Once more, I'm feeling down about winter. Honestly, I need to remind myself to chill out because it's pretty selfish. When I think about it, I'm in a much better position than about 99% of the global population. I'm here whining about a dance, which is really on me. I should've just asked someone to go with me. This situation is such a letdown. It seems like literally everyone else has a date for this event. Gotta run...bye.", "Tonight's entry will be short since I'm really tired and need sleep. Today was pretty ordinary, though we had a fun late arrival. Mr. Alstadt won\u2019t be here for the next two days, so no music theory. \n\nThe only notable event was being called to Mrs. Plumbers\u2014but it was just a mix-up, so no worries. Jazz practice was frustrating with Nathan not acting like a section leader, and Tom being disruptive. Steve should be the section leader because he cares about our sound. \n\nAfter jazz, I had my lesson and that was it. I know this isn\u2019t exciting, but people expect me to write daily. \n\nOn a sad note, my great uncle Al passed away recently. Please pray for his wife and close family. Thanks, everyone. Goodnight. XOXO", "I miss Heather. She was the one person I could confide in. I really feel her absence. :(", "Wow, what a difference a day makes! Today was way better than yesterday, and it started off on a high note. I can usually sense how my day will go just from the morning vibes. Big news: I got my schedule sorted out, and I finally cleared things up with Kathryn. She totally understands now, which is such a relief because I was so worried she\u2019d be upset with me.\n\nEver felt like the whole world is ganging up on you? Trust me, it\u2019s a pretty lousy feeling. Right now, I feel kind of alone without any close friends to lean on when things get tough or when I'm feeling down. I really miss Amanda, Hillary, and Kelly. Lately, I've just been feeling so down and I can't even pinpoint exactly why. Maybe it's the emptiness of not having a best friend or the longing for a boyfriend. As much as it seems pathetic, I do want someone who listens to me and cares. But finding that special someone feels like a distant dream right now.\n\nYeah, I\u2019m heading to Winter, but I realize it\u2019s not the season I wanted\u2014it\u2019s the person I wanted to share it with. I envisioned going with someone special, not just a friend, and that realization just sucks. It\u2019s one of those times where I feel like crying, which is so unlike me.\n\nAnyway, today\u2019s a bit better. Sorry for the rant, just had an EXB moment. Not great! But I\u2019m trying to lift my spirits with some Dave Matthews. Love his music! So, yeah, I\u2019ve got to sign off now because people are actually IM\u2019ing me. Maybe I\u2019ll jot down some more thoughts later. Catch you later!", "The Bucs won, yay! I'm not typically a big football fan, which is odd since my whole family loves it and I'm in the marching band. Anyway, we have a small problem: I'm finally going to Winter, but Kelly's left out. We're thinking she could go with Neil since we all know him. I wish I could invite Kristen, Alex, Taylor, and her boyfriend, but I'm not sure if Kathryn and Joanne would be okay with that. I'm confused right now. School starts tomorrow, and it doesn't feel like it, maybe because of the Superbowl. I still can't believe we placed yesterday, though I wonder how many bands there were. Last year we got 5th out of 5, but this year we did great. I should sleep now. Good night, everyone!", "Everyone else is watching the Super Bowl, so there's not much else to do. I've been thinking a lot. I said I wanted to go to Winter and all, but now that I am, I'm not sure if I really want to. I mean, I asked him, but we're just going as friends. I want to go with someone I truly like, more than just a friend. I love him as a friend and we've known each other for so long, but I wish I were going with someone I have deeper feelings for. Oh well, it's still nice to be going. I wish it weren't so cold out; I need to go for a walk, or maybe a bike ride, just to think. I really do love people, but I need my alone time. It was like poor Emily on the Disney trip\u2014I just need to be alone sometimes!\n\nActually, I'm starting to get excited about Winter. I've been talking to Joanne and Kristen, and they\u2019re excited for me too, which makes me feel the same way. I think it'll be fun, especially with a group of people I enjoy spending time with! Anyway, more later. I'm actually having conversations with people who aren't watching the Super Bowl! Yay!", "Wow, I can't believe it. I almost wish I could have seen more class AA bands. JSO didn't win any awards, which completely shocked me because they are awesome. As Alex said, \"There must have been some seriously Godly bands if they beat JSO!\" \n\nBut oh well, considering JSO isn't my band, let's talk about Jazz Band. We placed 3rd, probably out of three bands, but still. It was nice to place, especially since JSO didn't, even though they're amazing and we, well, aren't. My soli went okay\u2014not too bad. I still need to play louder, and I didn't mess up any notes, just the timing a bit at measure 110. Overall, it was actually pretty good, I thought.\n\nAnyway, I'm not quite sure what's going on with Andy and Diane, but it seems like Diane is happy, and if she's happy, then I'm happy too. That's all I wanted to write for now. Haha, \"write for right\" amuses me. \n\nOkay, I must go do something fun since there's no homework! YES! I'll write more later, maybe. :)", "I am currently unable to write due to feeling incredibly unwell. I must acknowledge that I have acted foolishly.", "I had trouble sleeping because I'm extremely upset over what's happening. Zach is supposedly in surgery, and Richa has internal bleeding. It's devastating. There was also another accident in which a student died. I just want everyone to be safe, and I wish I had someone to talk to right now, but nobody is available online. I'm at a loss between crying and keeping it together. I mean, I have cried, but sometimes I wish I didn't care so much about people I barely know. It wouldn't hurt as much if only close friends affected me this deeply. It's so unfair because they're both such intelligent and kind individuals. Why them? I feel like expressing my care to important people in my life, but it's difficult for me to show my emotions. This whole situation makes me incredibly sad. I even wish I could go back to elementary or junior high days when everything seemed safer, and no one got seriously hurt or died. I also feel like I should do something to help, even though there's really nothing I can do. Praying doesn't seem enough; I feel the need to take some physical action. Maybe I just need to clear my head. I had planned to write about my day, but it seems trivial now. I just hope everything turns out okay for them.", "Why is it that bad things happen to good people? I desperately wish the mantra, \"Good things happen to good people,\" was always true. Unfortunately, reality often defies this hopeful notion. Tonight, two truly amazing individuals were involved in a car accident. Though they're in stable condition, it's heartbreaking. They are wonderful, principled people, and this shouldn't have happened to them. I'm fervently hoping for their swift recovery, and they are constantly in my prayers.\n\nRicha and Zach are invaluable to our school and have the potential to make significant contributions to the world beyond high school. I find myself grappling with the harsh truth: bad things do happen to exceptionally good people. This harsh reality urges me to reflect on my own blessings\u2014my wonderful family, financial stability, shelter, food, friends, and life itself. It's a stark reminder of how precious life is, often brought to light by tragedies like Kari's death or Richa and Zach's accident.\n\nI have a tendency to judge others when I perceive them as selfish, yet I realize I might be guilty of the same. In moments of crisis, a friend reminded me, \"It's times like these you have to have faith.\" And that I do. I pray every night, but sometimes it feels more like a routine than a heartfelt appeal. Tonight, my prayers hold profound meaning as I think deeply of Richa and Zach, hoping others will also join me in praying for their recovery.", "I can't stop typing in this thing!

I was talking to someone about this recently, and he confessed to doing the same thing\u2014adopting pieces of other people's personalities. It's silly.

I don\u2019t feel like typing now or later, for that matter. You know who it is, and if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re just not cool... XOXO", "YES! I was so excited thinking I'd made it into the Wind Ensemble, but my joy was short-lived. Turns out, the results weren't posted today as promised! Ugh, talk about a rollercoaster of emotions. First, they claimed, \"We'll post them on Monday,\" only to then tell us, \"Actually, we're not quite finished, they'll be up tomorrow.\" Seriously?! The suspense is killing me! Just had to vent my frustration to someone. Catch you later \u2013 fingers crossed for tomorrow! \ud83d\ude2b", "Amazing, just amazing! Haha, I felt an overwhelming need to say that! Anyway, today has been better, thinking about the audition and all. I haven't dwelled on it as much, but yeah... dun dun dun. The results are coming out tomorrow, but in the afternoon! Grrrrr, that's so annoying. I just want to know, whether it's good or bad. Oh well, it's frustrating, but not really that bad. I enjoy being myself :)", "Wow, I was really out of it last night. Do you want to know why? No, of course you know why\u2014I mentioned it about a million times. Ahhh... can't Monday come sooner? Time is dragging by, and it's the weekend. Time on the weekend isn't supposed to drag!\n\nWell, I took a break from writing to go read. I'm reading this book called \"Tangerine.\" I've already read it a couple of times, but for some reason, I really enjoy it. I'm not quite sure why.\n\nAnyway, there's not much else to say. I don't have any plans for today. My mom is leaving for a business trip in a few hours, so... yeah. I think I'll just go read some more.", "It's been a while since I last wrote. Last night, I went to a jazz cafe and it was fantastic. I was pleasantly surprised, as I didn't expect to enjoy myself and wasn't even keen on going initially. However, I ended up dancing throughout the JSO performance, and it was a lot of fun. That's all I have to say for now. I think I'll sign off for tonight and probably write more later. Good night, princes and princesses. :)", "I'm in such a good mood after talking to Christopher for two hours. I love that kid\u2014he's like a brother to me and always knows how to lift my spirits. Goodnight, princes and princesses! XOXO", "I just noticed that my entries have been getting sadder more frequently. Is it because I've been feeling more sad, or because I'm finally being honest with myself and admitting that I'm upset?", "We continue through joy and tears, discovering new frontiers. I miss Disney World a lot. I know I'd be happy if I were there right now.", "Finished my homework! Time for bed. Wish there wasn't school tomorrow. Goodnight! XOXO", "It\u2019s kind of like that, but not really. I\u2019m just avoiding this ridiculously tough government crossword puzzle that\u2019s taking forever! It\u2019s so frustrating\u2014worth more points than the actual test. Yay for government? Anyway, my weekend was fairly average. Didn\u2019t do much, just hung out and really cleaned my room. I mean spotless\u2014washed the hardwood floor and polished the furniture. It\u2019s almost unsettling how tidy everything is now. \n\nI love inventing words; it's so entertaining. Fortunately, I didn\u2019t have a gig this weekend, according to Brandon. Hopefully, he\u2019s right! I was supposed to hang out with Kathryn today, but instead, I went to lunch with Joanne and Diane. Kathryn seemed okay on the phone, but I think she\u2019s a bit upset about it. We\u2019ll make plans for next weekend though. \n\nBy the way, coffee smells amazing, even though I don\u2019t actually like drinking it. Matthew and I were chatting about coffee earlier. Am I rambling? Definitely. I\u2019m just procrastinating hardcore. Alright, back to the grind of homework. XOXO", "I think I may have upset Diane. I asked her numerous questions about being a vegetarian today, but I didn't intend to make her uncomfortable. I've never known anyone who is vegetarian before, so I was curious and wanted to learn more about it. I sincerely hope I didn't upset her. Maybe she's just having an off day. Actually, I don't hope she's having a bad day; I hope it's going well for her. But she does seem a bit upset, and I hope it's not because of me.", "Sometimes I wish people wouldn't read what I write, but other times I'm glad they do, as they get to hear my thoughts\u2014though that's not always a good thing. I was talking with Andrew, who amusingly thinks I'm a creepy kid. On another note, I might have a jazz gig, but I'm completely unsure about it. If it doesn't pan out, it's not my fault since I knew nothing about it.\n\nToday, I had lunch with Diane and Joanne, which was really enjoyable. However, I felt a bit guilty because Diane and I were talking about marching band stuff that Joanne doesn't know about, making her feel left out. This happens often when I'm with band folks, and I don't mean to exclude others. Despite that, it was fun reminiscing about freshman year, though I also enjoy sophomore year. Anyway, I need to go. If I hadn't gone crazy years ago, I probably would now... \n\nXOXO", "Sure, here's the transformed text:\n\n\"Alright, it seems the title wasn't the reason the page was extending horizontally. Honestly, I'm not sure. I don't feel like dealing with it.\"", "Certainly! Here\u2019s a refined version of your text:\n\n\"I revised the title to prevent the page from becoming excessively wide.\"", "You know, I was just thinking, Harry Potter needs an invisibility cloak to sneak around Hogwarts at night, but even with my white hair, I still feel pretty invisible most of the time. Honestly, I often feel like second or even third best. There are a few exceptions though, like Kelly and Emily. They're best friends, but they always make me feel like I'm just as important to them as they are to each other. Then there are some people who make me feel like I'm not good enough, like I'm just an afterthought. It's like, \"Oh, I guess we'll call you after we make sure everyone else isn't busy.\" Ugh, it's really frustrating. I try to brush it off, but it's tough. Oh well, just a thought. XOXO", "I didn't expect to be this upset over my brother leaving. I'm really going to miss him. It makes me sad to realize how little time I have left with my family, especially since I'll be heading to college in two years and starting my own life after that. I genuinely enjoy spending time with my family and get along with them well. They help me escape the shallow selfishness of high school, and we have meaningful conversations. I\u2019m just feeling really sad.", "It appears there is nothing else to be done at the moment. Therefore, I have decided to continue writing until my mother either calls or arrives home. This evening, my family and I are going out to dinner since it is my brother's last night here before he departs for Australia tomorrow. I anticipate that I will miss him greatly, as he has been a significant support to me and someone I can confide in, which has been quite surprising. While having the bathroom to myself will be a small consolation, it is not sufficient; I would much prefer to have my brother here. Over the past few months, we have grown much closer.\n\nTurning to less melancholic matters, today overall was rather somber. However, it was not entirely negative, just the experience of delivering my speech. The speech did not go well, and I have decided against practicing for speeches in the future, as it seemed to disturb my performance. Additionally, bringing my entire outline with me was a mistake. Nonetheless, I would rather not dwell on this topic any further, as it is quite painful to revisit.\n\nOn a lighter note, I wore a skirt today. While I appreciate skirts, my feelings towards them are ambivalent. In any case, my mother has just called to inform me that she is on her way home from the airport, which is wonderful news. I will now find something productive to do. Goodbye.", "Still can't access it. The servers are way too busy. I can sign in and everything, but I can't add an entry. Ugh.", "I am feeling extremely frustrated with Professor Semanic. Despite informing him via email that I couldn't attend the jazz caf\u00e9 event, which he wasn't able to cover anyway, he seems to have a serious problem. He unfairly criticizes us for inconsistency during rehearsals, yet he has just cancelled rehearsals for the next two weeks. His actions seem unjustified and hypocritical.\n\nAdditionally, I'm upset because I can't access my online diary to express my feelings privately. It's frustrating not to have that outlet available right now. I guess I'll try again to access it.", "Ugh, last night's gig didn't do my self-esteem any favors. It took a hit, big time. The performance was a disaster. Ugh, so frustrating. But tonight's gig went great! I actually had fun. Kelly drove, and we made a pit stop at McDonald's on the way back. It was awesome! We grabbed some food and cruised home, jamming out to the Now and Then soundtrack. We belted out the lyrics and I even busted some moves. Total blast!! Kelly S. is amazing, and I adore Kelly C. too! Seriously, Kellys just make my life better! Anyway, I'll really try to stop rambling on here. Maybe?", "Today was just another ordinary day, and honestly, I can barely remember half of what happened. I was so out of it. Haha, I wore my black hoodie with the hood up, and no one could recognize me at first since they usually identify me by my hair. I must have looked pretty out of it because like five people told me I looked stoned this morning. It was quite funny.\n\nThere's talk that the juniors might have to retake the ACT, which would be such a drag. Apparently, four answer booklets were stolen, so they held an assembly about it. The whole situation is pretty messed up.\n\nI really hate group work in math; it's the worst. Seriously, it's so frustrating. GRRRR! On the upside, I totally lucked out with my government packet today. I don't want to go into details, but I managed to score 33/35 even though I did the packet after the test, right before it was graded. It was a bit of a miracle, really.\n\nAnyway, I'm getting tired of typing in public spaces, so I think I'll switch back to my private diary. I still write in there, but occasionally I type here too. From now on, I might just stick to the diary because managing two entries is too much work for someone as lazy as me.", "I'm often indecisive, but for now, I've decided to keep writing here instead of my actual journal. Who knows why? My mind works in mysterious ways. \n\nSchool was okay today, nothing particularly special. I saw a lot of my friends and had a good talk with Emily over lunch. I think Dave might have read an earlier entry in here, because he's been a lot nicer to me the past couple of days, at least since Jazz Cafe. Maybe he's just gone back to his old self, which I really hope is the case. I missed the old Dave; he was different from most guys. \n\nAnyway, I didn't do much this past weekend. The only notable thing was hanging out with Chris, Jim, and Alex, which was a lot of fun. Alex's mom made us dinner, and it was delicious. Then we went to Chris's place to watch \"Swimfan\" and \"The Matrix,\" which I hadn't seen before. \"The Matrix\" was awesome! I don't usually like those kinds of movies, but this one was really cool.\n\nI have to go soon because we've got a gig at Ellsworth Elementary. It should be fun, and I wonder if we'll get to see the kids play. That would be so cool and do wonders for my self-esteem.\n\nBefore I go, I heard a really mean saying the other day that I thought was funny at first, but then I felt terrible for laughing. Someone said, \"I'm outta here like the fat kid in dodgeball.\" It's terrible, isn't it? I still can't believe I laughed; I feel so mean.\n\nAnyway, I probably won't write again tonight because of the amount of homework I have. Goodnight, princes and princesses!", "I\u2019m going to stop writing here because I found a private site where I can write freely. I might return here someday, but I highly doubt it.", "It's strange. I dislike eating in front of others. It always makes me feel guilty. I'm not sure why. I eat a lot when I'm at home. I should be half the size of Mexico.", "Sure, here is a refined version of your text:\n\n---\n\nI spent the evening with Chris, and it was fun. However, I think he might believe I'm really annoyed with him, which isn't true. I'm just generally annoyed with most people right now and feeling irritable. I can't wait for summer\u2014I really need it.\n\nWe went to Chili's, which was interesting since I haven't been there in a long time. I ordered a huge dessert that was delicious but too much to finish. I think I'll go running tomorrow to balance it out.\n\nThat's all I want to share for now, as I can't type everything I need to in this journal. Bye for now.", "I outsmarted the system. I was supposed to be researching for a speech and initially couldn't access this site from the school computer, but now I can. YES! Ahahaha, I outsmarted the system. I'm typing here even though I'm not supposed to be during school hours. I'm a rebel!!!", "Ugh, thanks to that infuriatingly DUMB platform, my entire blog post for today vanished into thin air. Stupid Blogger! I can't muster up the energy to rewrite it right now, so I won't. Maybe I'll jot down something later. Bye for now.", "I'm not smart.\nI'm not attractive.\nI lack humor.\nI'm not promiscuous.\nI generally dislike people.\nI'm not kind.\nI'm either too loud or too quiet.\nI find it hard to trust others.\nI'm self-centered.\nIf you can think of anything else, please tell me.", "Overall, today was pretty good. Yes, very good indeed. :)\n\nTurn off the faucet, sweetheart.\nWe're flooding the floor here\u2014what a mess!\nLet's drown out the neighbors, love.\nOur little tub has overflowed.\nNo more rap, no more dub,\nThe steam is almost hiding you away.\n\nIn our tub of love, I'll scrub all over you,\nAnd you can scrub all over me.\nJust move your leg a bit,\nAnd I'll move mine.\nWe'll get so clean,\nOur love will look pristine.\n\nI'm glowing now, and so are you.\nIn our tub of love, life feels brand new.\nWe're nearly perfect now, just the two of us.\n\nI don't interpret those words in a sexual way; they just make me reflect. Sure, they could be read sexually, but that's not how I see them.\n\nSo, yeah. Thankfully, there's no one special in my life right now. I'm sort of relieved I don't have a crush on anyone\u2014it spares me the awkwardness around people, and it's much less complicated this way.\n\nI'm really putting off my science lab. I wish I had gone to Kohl's with Brandon. Oh well. I chatted with Chris on the phone for a while and continued to avoid my lab.\n\nI've been talking to Erica a lot these past few days. It's been nice. Anyway, I must get to my homework now. :(\n\nUgh. Bye.", "Although Chris isn't upset with me, I still feel somewhat downcast. I can't quite pinpoint why. There must be a reason buried deep within me that I'm not aware of, but it's incredibly frustrating.", "Oh no! I think Chris is upset with me now because I acted foolishly and was curt with him last night since I was in a bad mood. I wasn't angry at him, just frustrated in general. Sigh, what can you do?", "I had a much-needed phone conversation with Kathryn; I'm glad she was available. :) I think I'll reach out to someone else as well, as I don't want to be alone tonight.", "I'm feeling lonely. There's no one around to talk to, hug, or just be with. Being in a big group of people won't fix it; I'll still feel alone deep down. It's difficult to explain. I need the right person to be with right now, but I don't even know who that is. I just need someone I can trust and genuinely care about. I think I want to spend tonight with Joanne, Kathryn, Kelly, and Mary Clare. I need people with whom I can have real conversations, cry without feeling embarrassed. I need a shoulder to lean on, but there's nothing there. Just air\u2014the air I need to live, the air I need to breathe\u2014but it's not helping me right now. I'm still sad. People only distract me from it temporarily.", "I just took a refreshing shower, which I love because they always leave me feeling rejuvenated and ready to tackle the day. With this invigorating start, I'm confident that today is going to be a great day, no matter what challenges come my way!", "Diane is an amazing person who is great at cheering me up, just like Joanne. That's all I have to say about it.", "After discussing my feelings with a particular individual, I find myself considerably less angry. I am very grateful for this conversation; you know who you are. It appears that speaking with someone who understands my situation was precisely what I required this evening. I am relieved that my anger has subsided, although I do not fully comprehend the reasons behind my earlier frustration. I was extremely upset, disappointed with the world, and quite annoyed. However, I am optimistic that things will improve by tomorrow. Goodnight.", "??????? - (1:31:56 AM): Hey, you\u2019re absolutely amazing! You\u2019re one of those incredible people who always knows how to lift my spirits. Thank you so much!", "I only want to talk to my mom, Ryan, and Alex right now.", "I don't understand why some people make me angry while others don't.", "Darn it. I am extremely angry, disappointed, and sad right now. It's quite disheartening.", "You know who's the absolute coolest person ever? Someone so amazing they deserve an award? Ryan. Ryan Dewitt. Thanks, Ryan! You're the best! Love ya!", "Guess what? I just discovered that Peter doesn't hate me after all! What a relief. It's such a weight off my shoulders because the thought of someone despising me is just the worst feeling ever.", "The past few days have been alright, just kind of relaxing. I've been sick all week, feeling terrible, so I finally decided to stay home since I didn't have any major commitments. Thank goodness for that. Getting some real sleep has helped me start to feel better. I had marching tryouts on Wednesday and Thursday, and yesterday we did the basics. It wasn't nearly as tough as I expected, thankfully. I'm actually glad I stuck with marching and promised my mom I would continue with it. We watched our senior movie that features the song \"We Go On,\" which brings back memories from my freshman year show and always makes me feel sad.\n\nLast night, I had a scary conversation with Chris. He asked me, \"What if I just told you how I really felt about you?\" I started panicking because I couldn't tell if he was serious, and I didn't know how to respond nicely since he'd already had a rough week. Later, someone asked me why I don't just go out with Chris. I don't think people understand that we're just good friends and nothing more. I could never date Chris; it would be too weird. No offense to him, but we both feel the same way.\n\nI'm tired of people assuming I want to date my guy friends. I discussed this with Bryan, and he's so easy to talk to. I'm grateful for his friendship, and no, I don't like him as more than a friend either. Enough said. You get my point. Goodbye.", "I stumbled upon an old journal entry today, reflecting on how I could never forgive him for what he did to her. But honestly, it's not my place to forgive\u2014it's hers. I despise his actions and would definitely kick his scrawny butt if he ever hurt her again, but forgiveness isn't mine to give. This entry might be confusing to anyone else, but I needed to get it out for my own peace of mind.", "I included that conversation with Katharine here because it lifts my spirits. It made me feel very special, and it will be comforting to revisit when I'm feeling down. I'm not sure if she truly meant what she said or if she says that to everyone, but it made me happy regardless. Unfortunately, I have a cold, courtesy of my mom from last weekend, and now my head, nose, and eyes are all in pain. The timing couldn't be worse, since I have an eye doctor appointment tomorrow and my eyes are constantly watering. Today wasn't very eventful and was quite boring overall. I'm involved in marching band, and there's some confusion about leadership roles. Brandon became the section leader for marching, while Peter got the role for music. Despite the confusion, it's good that Brandon has a higher position because Peter really doesn't like me. There's so much going on at once, but nothing particularly interesting to share.

Our post-movie hangout at Overweis was great for chatting, though the conversation took a tough turn. It stings when you feel like nobody really gets or cares about you. Everyone teases me, and while sometimes it's harmless fun, other times it really cuts deep. Particularly, I despise the jabs about my vision; it's not like I chose this, right? If people think it's so amusing, they should try fixing it themselves! \n\nDespite my pleas, they might stop for a moment but always revert. Why am I such an easy target? Sure, I'm not Miss America, but I consider myself a pretty decent person \u2014 kind, honest, and with good morals. But instead of appreciation, I'm constantly torn down. Why strive to be good when all you get is grief? Honestly, there\u2019s no point.\n\nI like who I am, but it\u2019s exhausting to stay on the right path when the world insists on knocking you down. It seems like bad behavior is celebrated \u2014 getting drunk, promiscuity, and cruelty are in vogue. Well, if that\u2019s the definition of cool, count me out. \n\nMy school environment is disheartening, and I find respect hard to come by. I'm eagerly awaiting summer for a break from it all, only to face the same cycle again next year. The endless parade of disappointment in people and their choices is draining. \n\nI crave an escape to Michigan, somewhere far from the negativity here. Even if I eventually see flaws in new faces, it will at least be a fresh start. It's baffling to see peers chase popularity for what? Four years of misery? Four years of self-loathing masked by forced attention? And for what\u2014people you might never see again? What a waste.\n\nHere\u2019s to hoping for something better.", "Today has been somewhat disappointing. I'm in a downcast mood, and I really want to see him. I know I shouldn't have feelings for him, and maybe I don't truly, but it feels like I do. I'd like to spend time with him outside of school. I imagine he'd be enjoyable to hang out with. Oh well. Tonight, I'm hopefully going to watch Bruce Almighty with Kathryn, which should be a fun time. Yay! Everyone seems so occupied, and my weekend feels incredibly dull. I'm not sure why, but... 'eh. I want to see someone I can't, and that doesn't help matters.\n\nYesterday was a good day. School was quite boring as usual, but last night I attended One Acts with Kelly, Kathryn, and Joanne. It was really funny, and Mary Clare tugged her ear five times to greet us from the stage. :) It was neat. During intermission, we joined a group of band people, and there must have been something in the air because we were all acting crazy! Wooo! Anyway, it was fun and... yeah, now I'm off to the movies with Kathryn! Woo hoo. Bye-bye.", "Absolutely! Here's a more enthusiastic version:\n\nShe said it was no big deal, but... I still think she's mad at me! She told me not to worry about her, so... I guess I'll try my best! I care about her so much and never, ever want to say anything that would make her upset. :) I need to put some thought into this!", "Yesterday was quite eventful. I managed to go the entire school day without speaking, as part of a bet, and ended up winning $20. It was challenging but interesting, especially since I couldn't write down why I was silent. Fortunately, one person guessed correctly, and after that, it became easier as he helped spread the word to others. \n\nAfter school, I had a bit of a panic when I couldn't find my dress for the concert, but eventually, I found it and attended the concert. Surprisingly, we performed quite well. During the concert band segment, Kristen and I noted six positive aspects: the red bow ties, recognizable melodies, a good beat, and their arrangement on stage where the tallest members stood in the center and shortest on the ends. We also appreciated Mr. S and another point which I can't recall now.\n\nOverall, it was a fun event, and I was happy to get home and rest. I slept soundly through the night, which was refreshing. Today was relatively normal, including the usual marching band practice where we performed \"Washington Post\" as we do for every parade, followed by some outdoor marching. Brandon drove me home afterward.\n\nHowever, I feel terrible about an incident with a joke. My friend, who is very thin, and I have this ongoing joke about her pretending to complain about being fat. I absentmindedly put up an away message saying I dislike it when skinny people think they're fat. Unfortunately, someone I didn't intend to hurt saw the message and seemed upset. I discovered this through her away message and diary entry.\n\nI tried to call her, but she was eating dinner. I really need to clarify that the message wasn't about her. This situation has taught me a valuable lesson about being careful with my words, which could serve as a good example for my upcoming speech on thinking before speaking. Thankfully, she came online later, and I had the chance to straighten things out.", "I had a really busy day with plenty to share, but I'm too worn out to write about it now. I'll put it all down tomorrow. It's funny how many times I used the words \"write\" and \"right.\" Anyway, I'm too tired, so goodbye for now.", "It's amusing to think about, but he's never had the right to do that. He's never earned it, even with all the time he's had. It would likely take him twice as long as he's known me to earn that right.

For now, stay away from me. I'm very upset and angry. Who are you to tell me anything when you can't control your own life? You're a huge jerk. Back off!", "Today was an average day. Band practice went as usual, though it was held in the auditorium, which is unpleasantly warm due to the lights. Thankfully, our Music Theory instructor remained silent; I wasn't up for a lecture. In Chemistry, we conducted a lab, but nothing noteworthy happened. In Health class, we reviewed the female reproductive system. A classmate named Kat isn't afraid to ask bold questions that most wouldn't dare to voice. She also shared some personal information that I could have done without, leaving us with an awkward comment about her menstrual cycle before departing. Speech class was dull; we had a quiz and some activities. I need to choose a new topic for my persuasive speech due to a lack of sources, and my speech is on Friday. Lunch was unremarkable. We had a difficult quiz in Math, and Government class was its usual fun. Just before Government, I entered one of my quiet moods while walking through the hall. I'm not upset or angry, I just sometimes prefer silence, although it worries others and they repeatedly ask if I'm okay. Anyway, I'm off to make dinner now. Goodbye.", "Someone bet that I couldn\u2019t stay silent for an entire school day. I\u2019m absolutely going to take on this challenge. It\u2019s going to be great. The only problem will be explaining this to everyone.", "I enjoy being quiet, but people always ask, \"What's wrong? Are you okay, Catie?\" I'm perfectly fine and happy, just quiet.

I really miss her. My trust in her is incredible; she's probably the most trustworthy person in my life, aside from my mom.", "I didn't end up doing anything, but I guess that happens sometimes. I just didn't want to spend my Saturday night alone. I really wish I could drive; it would be such an escape for me. Being able to drive would mean I could go places by myself without needing anyone else's help. It would be incredibly liberating.\n\nI'm longing for summer to arrive. I want to go to Michigan, feel the sand beneath my feet, and let the cool waves splash against my legs. I dream of walking alone along the beach at sunset, just being by myself in a beautiful place.\n\nI think I'll go read now. Bye.", "LOL, switched it up once more. This is seriously entertaining. Woooo! Alright, it\u2019s clear I'm having WAY too much fun now.", "I recently acquired a new template. While it is satisfactory in its functionality, I am particularly fond of its name: \"Aliens Stole My Wallet.\" The whimsical title brings me a certain amount of enjoyment.", "Life is quite enjoyable at the moment. Although I have plenty of homework to tackle, everything else is going well. I plan to head out later, which is exciting! I won\u2019t be spending my Saturday night by myself.", "I headed to Michaels to snag a shirt for our Chemistry tie-dye project. I was hoping for a long-sleeved one, but no luck! Guess it wasn't meant to be. Oh well, that's how it goes sometimes! Now, what fun adventure should I dive into tonight?", "This is a list of the colors people have mentioned so far:\n- Diane: Orange\n- Derek: Red\n- Kelly: Red\n- Matthew: Orange\n- Kristen: Orange\n- Joanne: Yellow\n- Mary Clare: Sky blue\n- Brett: Blue\n- Emily: Yellow\n- Dave: Sepia\n- Bryan: Bright yellow\n- Chris: Orange\n- Brandon: Green\n- Me: Brown\n\nI wanted to keep track of everyone's chosen colors, so I'm noting them here.", "Haha. It\u2019s astonishing to think about just how much of a loser I was during my childhood. The memory really amazes me. While I still consider myself somewhat of a loser today, reminiscing about the days when I would alphabetize my crayons really takes the cake. Wow, just wow.", "I'm glad I can stay home on a Friday night without feeling bad.", "Alright, here\u2019s my take on injecting some dynamism into your text:\n\nAlright, I've come to realize that if I were a crayon, I'd be brown. Let's talk about the brown crayon for a moment. It doesn't get the love it deserves. Hardly anyone appreciates it, except for a select few. Despite the lack of respect, everyone needs the brown crayon now and then\u2014for drawing trees, brown hair, you name it. Yet, how often do we stop to consider how indispensable the brown crayon truly is?\n\nThink about it: we constantly overlook the brown crayon, but it\u2019s crucial for so many creations. One day, all this neglect might just cause the brown crayon to explode from sheer rejection, and that would be a disaster. Kids are always drawn to the bright and flashy colors\u2014blue, purple, pink. But it\u2019s not about appearances. It\u2019s about usefulness and what the crayon can do.\n\nThe brown crayon is a silent helper, always ready to step in, even though it gets pushed aside. Reflecting on this, I get a bit philosophical when I'm tired\u2026 or maybe just a little weird. :)", "This week has been going well and is passing quickly, unlike the slow pace I expect next week. I don't feel like typing now, so maybe I'll write more later. I need to make dinner anyway.", "I find myself longing for Victoria's presence. The way she would always come to me when I called, the manner in which she was willing to do anything for me, is something I deeply miss. Her nightly companionship, as she slept beside me, was a source of great comfort. I fondly remember how she would respond exclusively to me, how she had a special bond with me alone. Others would often say, \"Catie, go get Victoria, you're the only one who can,\" and it made me feel unique. Her innate ability to sense my sadness from anywhere in the house and her determination to find and console me were irreplaceable.\n\nI miss my cat. MY cat. She was wholly mine, and her affection for me was genuine and unconditional. She accepted me entirely, without any desire to change who I was. Her love was pure and unwavering.\n\nThe memory of discovering her lifeless on the floor is something that haunts me\u2014I lost her in such a tragic manner. Her absence leaves a void that feels almost unbearable. If she were here now, she would listen to me, cry with me, and cuddle up to me, providing the comfort I desperately need.\n\nIt's hard to reconcile with the pain of thinking about that moment again, the moment I found her lying motionless. I've tried to avoid dwelling on it because the thought is too much to bear. Crying won't bring her back, though. The loss of something that loved me so completely feels as though a shard of glass has pierced my heart.", "I would genuinely appreciate it if people could answer this question honestly: What is wrong with me? Why does it seem like no one, except Matt, likes me? I truly don\u2019t understand. I think I\u2019m a decent person, but maybe I'm just fooling myself. Maybe I've been deluding myself all this time. It feels like I'm never going to find someone. No one seems even remotely interested in me. Everyone else finds someone and shares their happiness, but I get left out. I love that people trust me and confide in me, but it hurts when I realize that nobody talks about me to others. It feels like no one likes me, has ever liked me, or will ever like me. Right now, not only is the glass half empty; it feels completely empty and shattered.", "Hmm, what should I do? I'm so unsure and my thoughts are all over the place. Life feels so bewildering at the moment. Michigan. Michigan. Michigan. If I just keep focusing on that, I think I'll find some joy. :)", "Haha, so Angie and I came up with a fantastic analogy. Imagine abstinence is like Thanksgiving dinner. You skip all the snacks and meals throughout the day because you know the feast at the end is going to be absolutely amazing. Woohoo for abstinence!", "My mind screams no, yet my heart whispers yes. But I dare not listen to my heart. I foresee only grief and disgrace if I do.", "Even if I had feelings for him, I wouldn't act on them. Why do I hold back so much?", "They claim this is the best time of your life, and while I don\u2019t completely disagree, there\u2019s definitely some tough stuff that comes with it.", "Alright, I'm feeling really exhausted and eager to dive back into my awesome book, so I'm jotting down a quick reminder to write about these topics later:\n- My day\n- Cleaning out my locker / After-school adventure\n- Tyler\n- Watching Finding Nemo\n- Kathryn's outburst at the boys in the car :)", "I still can't begin to comprehend what he did to his first girlfriend.", "I'm genuinely shocked at how furious I am. I mean, I'm extremely angry\u2014beyond what words can describe. Wasn't it bad enough to hurt one person? Now you're trying to ruin someone else's life too? Another issue is that I can't be around her if she's with him. It would drive me insane. I'd feel an overwhelming urge to lash out.", "AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! Darn it, thanks for ruining everything, you jerk. Thanks a lot.", "Nothing makes my blood boil more than this! It's absolutely infuriating. And she's getting dragged into this mess despite my efforts. I can see her crumbling, and there isn't a darn thing I can do about it! Even if I expose him for the slimeball he is, recount his despicable actions towards his ex-girlfriend, she won't budge. She thrives on defying advice, and knowing her, she'd probably run to him even faster just to prove a point. UGH! It's nauseating. Seriously, it's gut-wrenching.\n\nHe's going to break her heart just like he did with his last girlfriend. Mark my words, he's got the makings of an abusive partner. The scary part is, he can seem so normal, but he's impulsive and dangerous. An abusive relationship is on the horizon, I can just see it. But she craves companionship so much that she's willing to overlook all the red flags.\n\nAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! This is an absolute disaster, and it's truly eating away at me. On a brighter note, I had a wonderful long chat with Joanne tonight. It was pure bliss. God, I love her! But it's hard to shake off this worry. He\u2019s going to hurt her, and not just emotionally; he might even hurt her physically. He's going to destroy her, strip away her dignity, and I know I'll be right. But trust me, saying \"I told you so\" will bring no satisfaction. It never does, especially when the stakes are this high. Everyone deserves a second chance, but he's blown so many with her. SO MANY. It's just maddening.\n\nI really need to get some sleep...", "Haha, I just noticed I wrote \"my kelly's\" as if I own them! Haha! They're all mine!", "Alright, I've made up my mind. There's no way I'm going to lose connection with my close friends like Kelly, Joanne, Kathryn, and Emily. I refuse to let that happen. I'm committed to this! HMPH!", "I've had a vision! When Kelly becomes rich and famous, I'll attend one of her concerts and try to get backstage. The guards will yell, \"GET AWAY, YOU WHITE-HAIRED NUTCASE!\" I'll protest, \"But I know her!\" They'll laugh, but then Kelly will appear and say, \"Catie, my love.\" I'll laugh right in the guards' faces. It will be glorious!", "Despite the song's musical shortcomings, I still love it. We talked all night about our futures and where we'd be by 25, thinking things would never change. As we leave this year behind, we won't return. Hanging out is over since we're on different paths. If you have something to say, say it now because time is running out. We're moving on swiftly, with memories replaying like a silent film. I recall a night in June when love was new and overwhelming. \n\nWe spent hours talking on the phone, feeling both excited and scared, finding humor in life's unfairness. This is how it feels:\n\nAs we move on, we'll remember all our times together. Though our lives change, our friendship will endure. Whether we achieve big jobs and wealth, we'll reflect on our shared jokes, lessons from school, and rule-breaking. Will brainy Bobby become a stockbroker? Can Anna find a job that suits her? \n\nIt's not goodbye, but a new beginning. We wonder if we'll view tomorrow as we do today and if we'll succeed. We thought youth would last forever, but now we face adulthood. The past might linger, but we'll keep those memories. \n\nAs we go on, we'll remember all the times we had together. No matter what comes, we'll always be friends.", "I feel sad today because it was the seniors' last day. Although I don't know many seniors, their departure makes me realize how close I am to becoming a senior myself, which means leaving and not seeing my friends anymore. Next year, I will lose my best friend, Chris, and other close friends. I'm worried about Chris because I can talk to him easily and feel comfortable around him. I'm scared that after he goes to college, we might lose touch.\n\nHaving a specific best friend feels tough because they eventually leave or we grow apart. This has happened before with Christy and Amanda, although I know Kelly will always be my friend. We've known each other for so long, and I'm confident we'll stay in contact throughout our lives.\n\nI hardly talk to Christy anymore, and I only talk to Amanda because our moms are best friends. I still care about them, but we don't communicate much. As for other close friends, Kelly C. and I may grow apart as our lives take different directions, even though I'll support her career. I don't know what will happen with Kathryn; I think we'll try to stay in touch but eventually talk less. If Emily moves to Europe, staying in contact will be difficult. Joanne is already going to England, and our contact might also fade.\n\nI need to stop thinking about this because it\u2019s making me sad. I've had a blessed life, but change is hard for me to accept. This realization has truly bummed me out. Things feel so sad right now.", "What concerns me the most is that I wouldn't be surprised if that happened. I find it amusing to speak when no one around me understands my meaning.", "I miss my cat. But nope, not right now. I can't think about her now or I'll just start crying. I've shoved those feelings way back in my mind, and that's where they're going to stay.", "What do you do when the one person who likes you is the only person you truly dislike? He's the only person who will ever like me, and I can't stand him. Unbelievable! Just my luck.", "I'm going to keep smiling, acting like everything's fine, and pretending it doesn't hurt...because one day it really won't, and everything will be okay.", "I've been writing here increasingly often lately, and I can't quite figure out why. *Sigh* I'm not sure what's going on with me. It's a strange mix\u2014I feel happy yet sad simultaneously. It's as if something is missing, like there's something obvious that I'm failing to grasp. I'm just, I don't know...", "Time isn't really time at all. You can't leave without leaving a piece of your youth behind, and our lives are always changing \u2014 we'll never be the same. The more you change, the less you feel. But believe in me, believe that life can change and that you're not stuck. We're different tonight, and tonight is so bright.\n\nSometimes you might not be sure, but deep down you know you could be right if you just look inside yourself. The memories of your hometown never fade, and that's where you were born. Believe in me and in the urgency of now. Even if it feels like there's no more \"tonight,\" tonight is still so bright.\n\nWe'll cast away insincerity tonight, make things right, and truly feel everything. We'll find a way to embrace the night, savoring those indescribable moments. The impossible can become possible tonight. Just believe in me as I believe in you, tonight.", "I was just revisiting some of my very first blog entries, and wow, the transformation is incredible! It's truly amazing to see how much I've grown. Anyway, I stumbled upon this beautiful passage that I want to share again, just to keep it fresh in my heart:\n\n\"Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking. It is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.\" - 1 Corinthians 13:4-8 \ud83d\ude0d\n\nI absolutely adore this! I love the Bible! I love God!!! Sometimes, people might think I'm not a believer, but it's the total opposite. I just prefer to worship in my own quiet, personal way. I don't like imposing my beliefs on others. It really bothers me when people try to force their views on someone else. My love and devotion to God are unwavering, and that's all that matters to me. Honestly, if others don't share the same belief, that's okay, because nothing I say will change their minds.\n\nIt baffles me why so many wars are fought over religion. Don't you see that this is exactly what God doesn't want? Killing in His name is so contradictory, and it frustrates me so much. Can't we just let everyone believe in what they want to believe? Why must there be conflict?\n\nPhew, sorry for the vent! Just had to get that out. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udf1f", "Absolutely! Here\u2019s a more enthusiastic version:\n\nWow, you won't believe what Katharine just told me! She shared this *incredible* song that she and Diane are absolutely obsessed with. And guess what? I *love* it too! The lyrics are just so captivating:\n\n\"The strands in your eyes\nThe color them wonderful\nStop me, steal my breath\nEmeralds from mountains thrust towards the sky\nNever revealing their depth\n\nTell me that we belong together...\"\n\nIsn't that just amazing? I can't get enough of it!", "I was contemplating sharing the details of my day, but you know what? I think I'll embrace the outdoors instead! Stay tuned; I'll have more to share soon.", "Okay, my stomach is starting to feel better now. I took more Advil. Thank goodness for medicine\u2014legal, of course. Haha. Anyway, I'm going to read a bit and then sleep.", "Ouch, my stomach really hurts a lot right now. I feel like crying.", "AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! I am exceedingly stressed at the moment, to the point of feeling overwhelmed. I find myself growing increasingly intolerant of him. It seems as though he goes out of his way to provoke me intentionally, as if he wakes up every morning with the intention of finding ways to infuriate me.\n\nI recently went online and concluded that engaging in a conversation with anyone right now would be futile. It\u2019s imprudent to even consider such an attempt because I am likely to say something I do not mean. I am experiencing a profound sense of distress and loneliness. Despite having wonderful friends, I cannot escape this feeling of solitude. I acknowledge that feeling lonely is a normal part of the human experience. Paradoxically, though I feel lonely, I also desire solitude at this moment. I am not inclined to interact with many people at school tomorrow; I would prefer to be left alone, without being subjected to conversation, nagging, teasing, or any other forms of interaction. I only wish to see a select few individuals, such as my close friends at lunch.\n\nI miss Amanda profoundly and wish she had not moved to Texas. Similarly, I wish I could see Heather, as well. If she has undergone some positive changes, I would welcome the opportunity to spend a great deal of time with her this summer. It feels as though today and tomorrow cannot pass quickly enough.\n\nReflecting on my own advice, \"never let the sunset on tomorrow before the sun rises today,\" I recognize that I am not fully adhering to it. I had an unusual dream the other night involving someone I am very close to, and I am still trying to interpret its significance.\n\nAt present, I must focus on completing this speech assignment so that I can read and sleep. I am grappling with a deep sense of unease and uncertainty about what is wrong with me. I wish someone could provide me with some clarity.", "Sure thing. Here it is:\n\nAbsolutely. I have to retreat to my sanctuary. Solitude calls me. I must reconnect with my true self. I long to smile, to laugh heartily, and to envision impossibilities and fantasies. Regardless of their reality, I crave the dream. This is essential for my well-being. I need my own company, and nothing more.", "Uh oh, I'm in that mood. The one where everything and everyone annoys me. I'm getting offline, staying away from everyone, and just working on my speech. No way I'm talking to anyone tonight. Too dangerous. Way too dangerous. I hate when I get in these moods. It's probably because I'm already feeling crappy. OK, going to finish my speech.", "Yes! Finally! This wasn't working before for some strange reason, and it was driving me crazy. I feel awful. My stomach really hurts. :( Stupid guys. Seriously, they NEVER have to deal with anything. Grrr.\n\nSo, today was an okay day. Only 4 more days of actual class left. In Wind Ensemble, I went to the writing center and worked on my speech outline. I was amazed that I actually got some work done. Then, there was music theory. Gosh, I can't wait to get away from that class. Seriously, yuck. The teacher just kept talking and talking. It felt like it would never end.\n\nChemistry was okay. We got a ton of really confusing notes, though. Sometimes Mr. K is all right, but other times he just drives me nuts. Health was really boring and pointless, just a lot of busy work. We had to write stories using 15-25 words from the chapter, which felt very pointless.\n\nSpeech was okay. I didn't have to give my speech today. Someone else gave a speech on plastic surgery, which was... interesting. Lunch was okay, and math was boring, though I think I actually understood what we were doing. In Government, we just watched \"12 Angry Men.\"\n\nOverall, it was a pretty boring day. I think I'll work on my speech now so I can eat dinner, read a bit, and go to sleep early. That would be nice. OK, bye!", "Good morning! \ud83e\udd1e I'm really hoping for a smooth day today\u2014fingers crossed I don't have to give that speech and that Mr. A is a no-show. \ud83d\ude02 Just had a funny thought... if Alstadt ever somehow read this, A) I'd probably never make WE again, and B) I'd feel pretty awful\u2014or maybe both! \ud83d\ude2c Yikes. Maybe it\u2019s time to cut down on the Alstadt stories here. I mean, he does get on my nerves, but still. Anyway, off to school I go. Wish me luck! See ya! \ud83c\udf1f", "Oh no, this is awful! These images are really disturbing. I feel sick...", "I'm really anxious. I haven't had a chance to chat with Alex recently, and the thought of losing him as a friend is troubling. He's such an incredible person, and I can't bear the idea of our conversations ending.", "I've always found the phrase \"shifty character\" amusing.", "Hey, I finished my music theory composition! Yes! I finally completed something from my list! How awesome is that? I never called the boy I swore I would, but I couldn't work up the courage. Okay, so maybe I was never going to. I just can't do it. I talked to a cool kid on the phone anyway, so overall, it was an okay Sunday evening.", "It's interesting\u2014I just realized how rarely I mention my dad. Tonight, someone on the phone asked where he was, almost implying he wasn't around anymore. But he's here, and he's a great guy. I get along well with him and my family overall. Although I don't share personal stuff with my dad like I do with my mom, we still talk.

Take care!", "To-Do List:\n- Complete music theory composition\n- Start and finish the final speech, including the outline\n- Spend some time playing basketball outside\n- Enjoy a cookie with milk\n- Call *Boy* :) (Wishful thinking...)\n\nAlso:\n- Accept that it's not summer yet\n- Buy new earrings\n- Focus on tasks instead of procrastinating through blog writing\n\nMore tasks to come as I think of them.\n\nReflecting on everything... life is really good.", "I strongly dislike homework with an intense and burning passion.", "I'm really trying hard to avoid doing my homework right now. It's so frustrating, and I really don't want to do it at all. I'm stuck working on my music theory assignment and it's awful. I absolutely hate music theory with a passion. I regret taking the class because I just don't fit in. I'm terrible at writing music and not great at music overall. It's really annoying. On another note, my patience is running thin with someone at the moment. It's becoming increasingly difficult to keep my cool with him, even over small things. He's really getting on my nerves, and it seems like he knows exactly how to push my buttons. Anyway, I'm out of here like the last kid picked in dodgeball. Poor kid. :(", "Yes, I have made a decision. It is remarkable how spending merely an hour and a half with close friends can provide such clarity. This evening, I visited Kathryn's house, and we spent time together, engaging in various activities. It was an enjoyable experience, and I truly cherish their company. Although Kelly was not present, the evening was still quite delightful. Furthermore, I had the opportunity to drive, which I found enjoyable. Since I am feeling somewhat tired, I will retire for the night, provided that I am not interrupted by instant messages. I must admit, I have a tendency to get engrossed in conversations on AIM. Nevertheless, such is life.", "I can stop pretending to clean now. Why am I so scared of bugs? I saw an ant and freaked out. I sprayed it with Fantastik and now feel bad, but anything with more than four legs terrifies me. Anyway, I'm going to Kathryn's tonight, so I should eat dinner and get ready. I'm content right now.", "I'm not sure why I'm so excited to go to Michigan, but I am. I can't wait! Last night, I was talking with Lauren about partying, and I really want to let loose and have some fun. However, I promised myself I wouldn't drink. Sometimes I regret that promise, but I know I can still have fun without drinking. \n\nI guess I just want to feel included. A few months ago, Pat, his friends, and my brother invited me to hang out, but I didn't go because they would be drinking and getting high. Although I know they'll be doing that again, at least Conor doesn't drink, so maybe I'll spend time with him when the others start drinking.\n\nI asked Max if he could bring along a non-drinking guy who isn't interested in Sara. He jokingly said that wasn't possible! Part of my conversation with Lauren was amusing, so I wanted to include it here:\n\nLokiluna13 (11:24:21 PM): hey, I'm a rule breaker all the way\nLokiluna13 (11:24:29 PM): I do drugs all the time and drink\nbaby bear 321 (11:25:37 PM): hahahaha\nbaby bear 321 (11:25:44 PM): can i quote that?\nLokiluna13 (11:25:56 PM): lol\nbaby bear 321 (11:26:00 PM): thats sooo goin in my profile\nLokiluna13 (11:26:08 PM): I do!!\nLokiluna13 (11:26:12 PM): haha\nbaby bear 321 (11:26:35 PM): let me guess\nbaby bear 321 (11:26:43 PM): u drink pop and take advil??\nLokiluna13 (11:26:58 PM): yeah... but both at once, and I'm telling you, you're NOT supposed to do that.\nLokiluna13 (11:27:02 PM): It's dangerous!\n\nHaha, this conversation makes me laugh! Anyway, we have big plans to play a prank on the guys this year. We just need to come up with a really good one.

It could take years to find you and to find myself. I don't need your answer; I need you to see that it's time to break down these walls between us. \n\nAm I still breathing? Have I lost that feeling? Am I made of glass because you see right through me? You're the only one who sees that I don't know who I am. I can't ask these questions because they can't be answered today.

Although, it doesn\u2019t really matter since this is like my diary, and I don\u2019t put anything super personal in here anyway. \n\nThankfully, I can write about Ryan because he never reads this. I'm concerned about tomorrow. Initially, I was supposed to spend the entire day at Great America with him, but I opted out because a lot of people I know will be there, and I don\u2019t feel like bumping into acquaintances all day. \n\nThen, we planned to do something else, like bowling or catching a movie, but now I'm having second thoughts. If I see him, I think I might start liking him again. I really don\u2019t want to go down that road because a relationship between us just doesn\u2019t work. There was a reason I broke up with him before. Why put myself through that again? It only caused pain for both of us, and it took a while to rebuild our friendship. But I guess I\u2019m not being a good friend if I avoid him. If I do see him, I know there\u2019s a good chance we\u2019ll end up back together by the end of the day. I\u2019ve considered it, but partly because I want to be in a relationship with someone. \n\nAnyway, tonight was fun. I went to Peter\u2019s party. It was decent... although I didn\u2019t know many people, and Chris and Brandon were off playing video games. Luckily, Kelly and Annie were there, and I\u2019m really glad to have them as friends. I ended up leaving the party a bit early and just hanging out with Chris for a while. It was nice.\n\nThat\u2019s about it. I\u2019m just really anxious about tomorrow. I felt like I was being inconsiderate to Chris, listening but not fully present. Sigh. I guess whatever is meant to happen will happen. We'll see, we'll see.", "My day was great! I slept in because I had my lunch final and went in later to take my government final. I'm glad I didn't study because I got a 97%. That was awesome.\n\nAfter the final, Kelly, Joanne, John, Kathryn, Mary Clare, and I went out to lunch. We tried three restaurants, but the first two were too full, so we ended up at Einstein's. I thought about getting a peanut butter and jelly bagel but decided to wait until I'm with Diane. Sometimes I feel like Diane doesn't like me or doesn't trust me. I want to be better friends with her, but it doesn\u2019t seem like she wants the same. Oh well, I\u2019m not giving up yet.\n\nAfter Einstein's, we went paddle boating, which was a lot of fun even though it was a bit chilly. One tip: don't try switching seats when you have four people in the boat. Later, we went to Starbucks, but since I don't like coffee, I got a fruit drink. Yum.\n\nKathryn's mom picked us up and drove us to Joanne's place. We hung out, did karaoke, and played spoons with forks, which was dangerous. I cut myself, but Joanne gave me an Elmo band-aid that made my day. I think we might have upset Kathryn, but she didn\u2019t show it.\n\nTonight, I\u2019m going to Peter's party. I wasn't sure about going, but since so many people are going, I decided to give it a try. Chris is driving me there in about an hour. \n\nTomorrow will be great, too. I'm hanging out with Ryan all day. We decided not to go to Great America since so many people we know are going. Anyway, I think I\u2019ll just relax because there\u2019s NO SCHOOL! Woohoo!", "Today was dull and boring; there's not much I even want to write about. Heh. Oh well, at least tomorrow will be fun.", "My day was excellent, superb, and wonderful! Initially, I was really dreading it. In fact, this was perhaps my easiest day, yet the anticipation was still unnerving. The reason? The presence of Mr. Alstadt, who can be rather unpleasant at times. Unfortunately, it is a truth I must state.\n\nI spent some time in the band room before school. Surprisingly, it was open, which amused me greatly. Remarkably, Mr. Alstadt was absent. \n\nSubsequently, I took my speech final, which I found to be quite manageable. Without any prior studying, I secured a B. This is satisfactory as I will still achieve an A in the class, even with a score as low as 68% on the final.\n\nFollowing that, I attended band class. Since we had already taken our final on Friday, there was nothing to occupy our time. I anticipated that staying would mean sorting commencement music, which needed to dry out after yesterday\u2019s incident. Consequently, Kelly and I decided to venture out. We walked to Burger King for a meal, which was an enjoyable experience. We purchased kids meals and delighted in the accompanying toys. It was quite fun. Upon our return, it appeared that our absence had gone unnoticed. Mr. Alstadt took attendance, but it was of no consequence. With only two days of school left, there was little concern over any repercussions. Moreover, my parents would not mind.\n\nRegrettably, we then proceeded to music theory class. It was more tolerable than I had expected. I managed to prove Mr. Alstadt wrong, which was exhilarating! He claimed that transitioning from A major to C major would not sound pleasant. To my satisfaction, my composition, though perhaps not exceptional, sounded acceptable, thereby contradicting his assertion.\n\nIn conclusion, today was quite eventful. Additionally, Kelly and I received scratch-and-sniff stickers with our kids meals. One of the stickers, featuring a foot, emitted an exceptionally unpleasant odor. Nonetheless, this amusing discovery was a fitting end to the day. I believe I shall now engage in something more constructive.", "Today brought about a somewhat somber mood. I awoke at approximately 10 AM and initially couldn't locate my shoes, despite searching the entire house. Eventually, I did find them. I proceeded to take a shower, under the impression that everything was fine since I had found my shoes. However, I soon discovered that my dress had a tear in it. In a bit of a rush, my mother managed to repair it for me, and I arrived on time nonetheless.\n\nOur commencement ceremony took place outside. Fortunately, once we were done performing, we were allowed to go inside, unlike the unfortunate seniors who had to remain outside. It was rather surprising that the ceremony wasn't held indoors from the start. Consequently, our music was ruined, and my hair, dress, and feet got completely soaked.\n\nAfterward, Chris gave me an unexpected ride home, where I changed into dry clothes. We then headed to Chipotle to meet Brandon and Bryan. It was quite enjoyable, and I tried their food for the first time, finding it delicious, although I couldn't finish the entire meal. Subsequently, we visited Coldstone, where I had chocolate ice cream with gummy bears, which was absolutely delightful.\n\nChris and I spent some time driving around and talking before I returned home to attempt studying for math, but finding myself unable to concentrate, I decided to write instead. It was an eventful day. \n\nInterestingly, when friends fear that sharing their thoughts might cause you to dislike them, and then they do share, you might find that their honesty brings you closer instead. It wasn\u2019t what I anticipated\u2014I expected to be upset but found myself more appreciative of their honesty and trust.\n\nI feel quite trusted and trustworthy at this moment. I realize this might be somewhat confusing, and I apologize if it is unclear. Nevertheless, I doubt anyone reads this anyway. That being said, I must attempt to study, though I doubt any progress will be made.", "Ugh, tonight has been incredibly painful for me. My heart feels like it's been torn to shreds repeatedly. Just as it starts to heal, it gets ripped apart all over again. The pain is unbearable.", "Sure, here's a friendlier version:\n\n\"Looks like I'm the odd one out without a partner again. What a wonderful feeling! Just kidding, of course.\"", "No way I'm letting this bring me down, dag nabbit!", "I am uncertain at the moment. Circumstances appear to be quite unfavorable currently. I dined at Pizza Hut this evening with my friends, but the experience did not meet my expectations. I find myself in a particularly bad mood, making it difficult to enjoy activities. I have the sense that my summer is being entirely squandered. I am not sure of the reasons behind these feelings, but they persist. Currently, I am experiencing a mix of frustration and sadness. Perhaps tomorrow will bring an improvement.", "Hm, alright...so, while everyone headed off to Germany, which is a bit of a bummer, I've been keeping myself super busy! It's been fantastic! I'm still in touch with Chris and Kelly, and all, but I've also been spending time with my other friends here. Just yesterday, I hit the pool in the middle of the day, and guess what? No sunburn! Well, except for a small spot on my face where I probably missed with the sunscreen, but still! I was thrilled and had a blast! Later, I went to Kathryn's place with Joanne and Kathryn, and we just chilled. It's a bit odd just hanging out with the two of them. Oh well. Then, I had a sleepover at Joanne's last night, which was really fun. Surprisingly, I got a decent amount of sleep, although it wasn't the best sleep since sleeping on the floor is quite painful. Hmmm, we watched The Princess Bride! I'd never seen it before and it was absolutely great! YaY! It was a lot of fun! Also, haha, Joanne can't stand not knowing something. It was hilarious. Kathryn mentioned something that we couldn't tell Joanne, and it drove her wild not knowing. Usually, she's in the loop about everything, so this one secret really got to her. Good times. So today, I've been busy with cleaning and other stuff. Tonight, I'm heading out with Katharine, Diane, and maybe Steve and Jeff. It should be super exciting! :) I must wrap this up. I have quite a bit to do actually.", "I don't believe it will ever happen.", "My day was fairly decent. I enjoyed giving my dad his presents, which was fun. Besides that, I didn't do much except play the computer game Civilization, which is incredibly addictive!\n\nTomorrow, everyone is leaving, and I\u2019m really going to miss them, especially some of my closest friends. It will be tough without them around. I doubt they\u2019ll miss me, but oh well.\n\nI also cleaned my bathroom today, which I absolutely despise. In fact, I hate cleaning altogether. I hope I can be wealthy enough in the future to hire someone to do it for me, or perhaps marry someone who enjoys cleaning\u2014though that seems unlikely!\n\nI've been chatting with Kelly, and I\u2019m going to miss her and Chris the most. I'll write more later... maybe.", "It's strange, but I find myself liking him less and less every day. Actually, it's not strange\u2014it's quite terrible. He angers and frustrates me almost every time we talk. Some people are just really annoying.", "I recently looked at my first blog entry and thought, \"Wow, Catie, you were such a dork.\" It's a bit scary. I wonder if I'll think the same about my posts in seven months. Surprisingly, I've stuck with writing here, even though I've never kept a real diary\u2014it always felt like whining to paper. Somehow, whining to a computer screen is different, and I've kept it up. I don't plan to stop anytime soon. Interesting thoughts, but I'm not in a reflective mood right now. Time to read and wait for a good storm! :)", "That was odd\u2014rain, then sun, now clouds. Weird. I wonder if storms will pass through all day. I enjoy storms, as long as they're not deadly. Stormy weather is perfect for snuggling with a blanket, stuffed animals, and a good book. It's fun, even if that's a strange definition of fun.\n\nI can't believe everyone is coming home on Monday. I'm excited, but time has flown by. I've met new people and had a blast. Only 13 days until Michigan, and we're almost definitely going to Italy for Thanksgiving. I'm SO excited! Italy is one of my favorite places in the world. If my mom gets her bonus, we might fly first class. That would be amazing\u2014first class on an overseas flight! As a 5'0\" person, coach isn't terrible, but first class would be awesome. I'm really looking forward to the trip. However, if the marching band goes to the Macy's parade, I'll miss it, which is a bummer. But still, I love Rome.\n\nEverything's too quiet in my house. I should check it out\u2014quiet makes me nervous.", "This evening, during a conversation, I was asked if I cry often. It struck me as somewhat amusing, considering the rarity with which it occurs. I cry only when matters of great significance arise, when accumulated emotions become overwhelming, or upon hearing a profoundly beautiful song that evokes deep feelings. Music unveils emotions within me that I wasn't previously aware of, and its power is extraordinary. While I do not intend to pursue music as a career, I am deeply grateful for its presence in my life and hold immense respect for those who create remarkable music. With that said, I now retire for the night.", "Haha, wow... I'm having a hard time typing tonight. My fingers are clumsy for some reason. I have to type every word twice. Grrr.", "I'm wide awake and, for once, not in the mood to read. It's strange because I woke up at a reasonable hour today. Maybe I should stop writing here and go chat with my friends. I was talking to about five friends, but all the conversations ended at once. Too bad. Katharine just told me I should go to sleep. She's right, I probably should. Will I? Probably not, unfortunately. I should really take my friends' advice on sleeping; they give good advice.\n\nI heard that Chris, Mike, and both Daves were drinking in Germany. It kind of disappoints me, especially since I heard they got drunk. One of the Daves particularly surprised me. We had talked about drinking before, and he emphatically told me he didn't drink. I remember feeling like I'd offended him with the question at the time. But, in the end, it's their choice, not mine. I guess I lost some respect for Dave, though.\n\nAnyway, I'm off to go talk to my friends because they're cool. I think I'll go to sleep feeling happy. Plus, I finished my book, which is nice. Time to find a new one. Off I go!", "Hmmm... Should I dive in or not? Probably not. I'm such a scaredy-cat. More like a headless chicken running around aimlessly! Speaking of which, that tale of the chicken that survived headless for about 15 hours has always fascinated me. It's tragic that someone would decapitate a chicken, yet the science behind its bizarre survival captures my curiosity. What kept that bird clucking?", "I just realized something: I've always been worried that people might think I'm weird because I go to the park, swing on the swings, and listen to music when I need to think. But you know what? I don't care. Everyone has their own place to think, and that's mine. I don't even know why I chose it; it just relaxes me and helps me filter my thoughts. I tend to overthink, and I can't do that effectively at home. It's not that my family doesn't give me privacy\u2014they do\u2014but I still prefer the park. It's where I go, and I like it, so I don't care if people think I'm weird.", "And I'd sacrifice eternity just to touch you because I sense you feel me in some way. You're the nearest to heaven that I'll ever get, and I don't want to leave right now. \n\nAll I can savor is this moment, and all I can breathe is your life, since it will end eventually. I just don't want to miss you tonight.\n\nI don't want the world to see me because I don't think they'd understand. When everything is destined to break, I just want you to know who I am.\n\nYou can't resist the tears that won't come or the truth hidden in your lies. When everything feels like a movie, you bleed just to feel alive.\n\nI don't want the world to see me because I don't think they'd understand. When everything is destined to break, I just want you to know who I am.\n\nI don't want the world to see me because I don't think they'd understand. When everything is destined to break, I just want you to know who I am.\n\nI don't want the world to see me because I don't think they'd understand. When everything is destined to break, I just want you to know who I am.\n\nI just want you to know who I am. I just want you to know who I am. I just want you to know who I am...", "You're standing on a ledge, looking like you might fall or thinking about jumping. You could have it all with a bit of patience. Though I cannot fly, I'm not content to crawl. Have a little faith in me; I want to be with you forever if it's not too late. Never let the sun set on tomorrow before it rises today.\n\nIf I'm not what you dreamed of, I will let you down. If I'm here just to watch you suffer, I will let you down. You're walking on the edge, waiting to fall, not noticing the hands ready to catch you. You find faults in the heart given to you. Though you cannot fly, you're not content to crawl.\n\nIt's always too late when you feel you've got nothing, but don't let the sun set on tomorrow before it rises. If I am another waste of your hopes, I will let you down. If I'm just here to watch you suffer, I will let you down.\n\nWe make up answers as we go. I won't talk of dreams or promises we can't keep. I will never leave you or let you down.\n\nThis song has been a favorite of mine since I first heard it, and the quote on this webpage comes from it.", "Kelly, Kathryn, Joanne, and Mary Clare invited me to see the second Charlie's Angels movie with them, but honestly, it's just not my kind of film. I wasn't impressed by the first one, so spending money on the sequel doesn't make sense to me. Instead, I chose to enjoy a relaxing evening at home. Sometimes, a night in with your own company is the perfect way to unwind.", "To the one with sorrowful eyes, do not be disheartened. I understand that it is challenging to summon bravery in a world abundant with people, where it is easy to lose perspective. The darkness within you may cause you to feel insignificant.", "Why do I get so anxious when I think even one person might be a little upset with me? It's incredibly frustrating. I wish I could just brush it off. I need Kelly and Chris to come home soon. I want to talk to them, but I'm stuck waiting for an email reply that takes forever. *Sigh* Monday, please hurry up! I'm just really frustrated right now.", "Today, I'm spending time with my family, which is always enjoyable. Additionally, I need to clean my room to receive my new furniture\u2014my mom is great at motivating me with incentives. Anyway, I'm off for now.", "I have an incredibly good life, and it makes me so happy. Sometimes, it scares me because I feel too lucky, like my luck will run out eventually. All I can do is be grateful for what I have and hope it continues. Switching gears, I'm such a night weirdo. I wonder if it's something about the brain's late hours. And by the way, gummy bears are delicious at 2:22 AM.", "I didn't sleep last night, but it's no big deal. I'm not visiting Joanne's tomorrow, but don't worry\u2014we will watch it sometime. We've scheduled it for July 9th. It might happen later rather than sooner, but it will definitely happen.\n\nRight now, I'm chatting with someone who seems pretty cool. That's all I'll say about that. Haha. I'm going to finish my conversations and maybe read a bit since I'm not really tired.", "Heh. Alright, at this moment, I've chosen neither option. Both are off the table. Haha. Great, I'm back to square one. Dang it. This is frustrating, and so is my computer\u2014it doesn't seem to like me very much. But what does? :) La la la, I enjoyed a grilled cheese sandwich earlier. It was delicious, and tonight I'm having chicken parmesan. Hmm, I wonder how you spell parmesan... Oh well. I think I'm going to go find somewhere else to be a loser rather than on my blog site.", "So, I planned to visit Joanne, but she can't hang out because she still has a lot of work to do in her mom's closet. That's fine by me since I'm not feeling too great today. It's just one of those \"meh\" kind of days. I think I'll probably make myself some grilled cheese and maybe read my book or watch TV. I love grilled cheese; I'm seriously addicted to it. \n\nI really should try to get on a better sleep schedule, but I know I'll mess it up again when I go to Michigan. So, it's probably pointless to try, as I refuse to go to bed at 9 PM every night while I'm there. I'm in a strange mood right now; just flung my ponytail holder across the room\u2014so weird. There's not much to talk about. I haven't decided on some things, but I did find out something useful. Maybe I should just forget it all and wait for college. Yay, college! Hopefully, there will be more mature guys there.\n\nJoanne is lucky, though it's amusing. I wonder how they will handle being apart for a whole year next year. Joanne really misses him, and he's only been gone for a week. But I have faith in them; I think they're one of those high school couples that will actually stay together. They're perfect for each other, and I'm very happy for them. :)\n\nAnyway, I think I'm going to make my grilled cheese now and read or something. I rarely sign off on this thing anymore. Oh well.", "I've realized something. Guys don't seem to like girls like me. They prefer girls who are mysterious, funny, interesting, or even just seem innocent. Hmmm. I don't want to change who I am, but it's frustrating. Just 16 days...only 16 days left. It'll be great to leave Naperville. I can't wait to ride the jet skis, go tubing, and simply relax in the hammock with a book. :) So refreshing. *Sigh* ARGH! July 11th, why can't you get here sooner??? Oh well. That's life. Hehe. Anyway, time for bed. Goodnight.", "It\u2019s a relief that this thing finally works. I may jot down a bit about my night, but I need to keep it short because I want to get some rest before heading to Joanne's at 1:00 tomorrow. The evening was quite uneventful, actually. I had plans to go out with Erica, Brett, and Roger, but they fell through, so I ended up at Joanne's place instead. We watched the first Harry Potter movie; it was decent. Unfortunately, Kathryn spoiled a part of the fifth book. I have this sneaking suspicion she did it intentionally by the way she timed her words. Both Kelly and I were pretty annoyed by it. Regardless, it was an okay night.\n\nOn a positive note, everything is smoothing out with Diane! I'm thrilled because there was an awkward spell between us that I wasn't sure we\u2019d overcome. Interestingly, there's a lot of tension in the air among everyone lately. It feels like people are in dire need of a break from each other. The atmosphere is just...strange.\n\nI really wish my mom were home; I need her advice on a decision that\u2019s been bugging me. It's frustrating not having a confidant who I feel comfortable discussing my personal thoughts with, especially about people I like. There are only a handful of people I trust, and even with them, these conversations aren\u2019t easy.\n\nI\u2019m considering making a list of reasons why I like each person I\u2019m contemplating, but that approach feels a bit mechanical. I have this notion that I should just intuitively know who is right for me. But who knows? Maybe I just need some sleep to clear my head. I was feeling incredibly loopy five minutes ago, but a more serious conversation brought me back down. I do cherish moments when I can be silly without worrying about judgment, though. Feels liberating.\n\nAnyway, it's time to wind down. I\u2019ll probably read a few pages of my book\u2014nothing to do with Harry Potter, though\u2014and then hit the sack. Goodnight!", "Ugh... I wrote a whole post, and Blogger didn't publish it.", "Hmm. I'm really not sure now... I speak to one person and make up my mind, but then I talk to the other. Ugh. I dislike making decisions.", "I miss my cat so much. :( I really, really miss her. I wish she was here with me. She'd totally be right by my side, and I could tell her everything.", "Oh my gosh, today was such an awesome day out with my mom! We had so much fun! I found the perfect furniture set that I am absolutely in love with, but it doesn\u2019t have the exact bed I want. Ugh! But I love everything else about it, so I think I\u2019ll just get that set anyway and maybe find an unfinished bed to paint a fun color or match it with the furniture. I can\u2019t wait to get creative!\n\nI\u2019m heading out again soon and trying to decide if I should wear something nice, but my comfy pants are calling my name. I adore them! They make me so happy. :)\n\nCan you believe it\u2019s only been 12 days since summer started? It feels so much longer! It hasn't even been two weeks yet! YAY though!! I am beyond excited for Michigan!!! AHHH! I seriously can\u2019t contain my excitement! Not only will I get to see people I miss so much, but I\u2019ll also have time to dive into Harry Potter! YaY!!! \n\nGrr, Blogger is acting up and not posting my stuff. Oh well, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll work eventually. Blogger can be so weird sometimes\u2026", "I sincerely hope she can find it in her heart to forgive me. I genuinely enjoyed spending time with her, but I was just in a rough mood that day. I even suggested we visit Great America sometime this summer. I feel terrible about the way I acted. I'm truly sorry, Diane. My mood was bad, and I wrongly directed my frustration at you. That's what I'll explain to her. I believe she might understand, as she's likely familiar with having bad days herself. At least, I hope she is.", "Oh no, now Diane thinks I\u2019m upset with her because of Pizza Hut. Ugh, this is such a mess! The truth is, I did have fun at Pizza Hut, but I was in such a terrible mood beforehand that I couldn\u2019t really enjoy it. I feel awful about letting my mood ruin the time we had together. I\u2019m definitely going to call her later to apologize. She didn\u2019t deserve to have my gloominess dumped on her, especially after being so sweet and inviting me out. That invite was honestly the highlight of my day. Hopefully, when I talk to her, she\u2019ll understand and forgive me.", "Oh great, now Diane thinks I'm upset with her because of Pizza Hut or something. :( It's not that I didn't enjoy my time at Pizza Hut, but I was in a bad mood beforehand and couldn't let myself have a good time. Oh well. I plan to call her later and apologize. I didn't intend to take my bad mood out on her, and I truly appreciated her invitation. That was probably the one positive aspect of that day.
