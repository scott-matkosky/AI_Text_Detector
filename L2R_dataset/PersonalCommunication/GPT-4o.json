It's like I have a radar for spotting new friends.\nI've never heard of that. But for me, honesty is what I value most in a friend.\nI agree.

Lately, gaming has definitely become my top pick.\nI've heard that many teenagers spend countless hours glued to their computers, often neglecting their health. What about you?\nI admit, I'm just as guilty. Some people say it's pointless to sit in front of a screen all day, but I actually find it mentally stimulating.\nYou don't play those violent online games, do you?\nOccasionally.\nThat's not great.

The U.S. is both one of the most developed and religious countries in the world.\n\nI've heard that a little before, but I don't quite understand. How can people believe in God when they know God doesn't exist?\n\nIt's a bit complex. You'll understand it better when you learn more about U.S. history. Religion has always been a significant part of American life. Even Harvard University, a highly academic institution, has roots in religion.\n\nReally?\n\nAbsolutely! It was founded by Puritan immigrants from England.\n\nWhy was it founded by Puritans? Where were the atheistic educators?\n\nMost of the early English settlers in what is now the United States were Puritans.\n\nWhy were so many of them religious?\n\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, England underwent several religious reforms, leading to the persecution of many religious separatists. They fled to other countries seeking religious freedom.\n\nSo, people didn't have religious freedom in England?\n\nCorrect. That's why Puritans moved to the New World, where they believed they could create a haven for their beliefs. It was these Puritans who established Harvard College.\n\nWhy did they want to found a college?\n\nMany Puritans had received a classical education at Oxford and Cambridge in England. They wanted their descendants to have access to the same kind of education.\n\nOh, I see.\n\nHarvard was originally called 'New College.'\n\nWhen did it become Harvard University?\n\nIn 1639, it was renamed in honor of its major benefactor, John Harvard, who was a clergyman himself.\n\nSo, Harvard has always been influenced by religion.\n\nIndeed. It's not an exaggeration to say that without religion, Harvard might not exist.\n\nWow, I didn't know religion played such a pivotal role in Harvard's history.\n\nReligion has been integral to both Harvard's history and that of the U.S.\n\nIt looks like I have a lot to learn about Harvard. My knowledge seems quite limited.\n\nRemember, Harvard is a part of the United States. To understand Harvard deeply, you need to know U.S. history and culture. The two are closely connected.\n\nYou're right. I have a lot to learn from you.", "I remain unconvinced by the explanation you have provided. Would you mind offering a more detailed clarification?", "What activities do you enjoy during the summer season?\nI love venturing out into the countryside for walks or bike rides. The fresh summer air is invigorating. How about you?\nI don't often go for walks, but I like to engage in outdoor sports such as tennis or badminton, or simply relax in the sunshine with a good book.\n\nWhat about winter activities?\nIn winter, I frequently participate in indoor sports. If I'm in a lazy mood, I prefer watching films at home. Overall, I favor summer over winter.\nMany people share that preference. I enjoy wearing nice, colorful clothes in summer, like dresses or skirts, which are too cold for winter weather.\nAbsolutely. I also appreciate wearing shorts in summer, but they wouldn't be practical in the winter cold.\n\nDo you anticipate a pleasant summer this year?\nWith global warming, we might experience hotter temperatures than ever before!", "Linda will always hold a special place in my heart, as she was my first love. While you believe that time will help me move on, I recall hearing that forgetting someone you're determined to remember can be challenging. Despite this, I trust that with time, everything will eventually change.", "I've been selected to organize the next family reunion.\nThat sounds like fun! Do you have complete freedom over the planning?\nYes, I do. I should start making plans now.\nDo most family members generally attend these reunions?\nAlmost everyone comes. Our immediate family alone has a few hundred members.\nHow many days will the reunion last?", "Hi, my name is Lean, and I'm from Russia.\nNice to meet you, Lvan. My name is Alike. I'm from Japan.\nEnglish is hard for me.\nA second language is always hard.\nTrue, but English is harder than most. It's a weird language.\nA weird language? Why do you say that?", "How was the film in your opinion?\nI enjoyed it. I thought it was fantastic.\nI enjoyed it as well. How did you find the acting?\nI thought it was superb. What about you?\nI wasn't impressed, I actually found it disappointing.\nThe cinema itself is nice, don\u2019t you think?", "What's up? You don\u2019t look so good.\nYeah, I just have a headache. I\u2019ve been in physics class all day. It\u2019s tough!\nI liked physics. It\u2019s mostly math\u2014arcs, curves, velocity, cool stuff.\nYeah, but today\u2019s lesson was about the creation of the universe.\nA physics class on the creation of the universe? That sounds more like religion than science.\nIt\u2019s all like religion. Think about the Big Bang theory. How can everything in the universe come from an explosion? That's as hard to believe as myths about Atlas or turtles in African stories.\nTurtles? Whatever... Look, creating matter just needs an imbalance of particles and anti-particles. At least, that's what the math says.", "Which film shall we see? There is nothing good at the moment. Let's do something different. Would you like to go to a concert?", "Everyone aims for financial success. To retire wealthy, it's essential to invest your savings. I'm considering purchasing stocks. It might be a sound investment if I can handle it properly. What's your opinion?\n\nI somewhat agree with you. While buying stocks isn't hard, earning consistent profits from them is quite challenging. Even experts struggle with it, so proceed with caution. For individuals like us, guidance in investing is crucial. Why not conduct some online research? There are numerous data, reports, and discussion forums to learn about investing. Additionally, you should check reputable websites that provide stock charts.", "May I use your suit?\nAbsolutely not.", "Bill, what's got you in such a great mood today?\nOh, guess what? I finally moved out of my place with that roommate.\nNo way! What happened?\nHave you ever heard of Brian Locker?\nBrian Locker? Doesn't ring a bell. How would I know him?", "Where are you from?\nI'm from Guangzhou.\nWhere is Guangzhou in China?\nIt's in the south of China.", "I need to leave now because I have an appointment at 6:00 PM.\nI understand. I won't hold you up any longer. Feel free to visit anytime.\nAlright, goodbye.\nUntil next time.", "Greetings! How was your first day of class? I am in level two and am thoroughly enjoying my class this semester. It is wonderful to be in a class comprised of international students.\n\nMy day was satisfactory, although no one in my class speaks English. I anticipate this will compel me to converse more in Chinese during class, which should lead to substantial improvement this semester.\n\nThis situation is both fortunate and unfortunate. My class resembles the United Nations! We have students from various parts of the world including three Germans, a Pole, a Scot, two French, an American, and a Brazilian. \n\nThere is certainly a remarkable diversity of nationalities in your class. Meanwhile, everyone in my class, with the exception of myself, is from Asia. We have a few South Koreans, several Japanese, as well as students from Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines, and Kazakhstan.", "I'm hungry. Are you?", "Good morning, Miss Li.\nMorning, Mike.\nI apologize for missing yesterday.\nI\u2019ve already received your sick-leave note.

Thanks.", "Do you like flowers?\nYes, I love them.\nWhat's your favorite flower?\nForsythia, also known as winter jasmine, symbolizes the arrival of spring.\nSpring is so lively.\nAbsolutely. What about you?\nI adore plum blossoms; they bloom beautifully even in the cold winter.\nYou have exquisite taste!", "What type of music do you enjoy?\nI enjoy energetic and upbeat tunes, like dance music. I actually hit the disco nearly every week. Occasionally, it can get a bit too loud. You lean towards classical music, right?\nIndeed, I do. I find it incredibly soothing. I often unwind with pieces by Mozart or Bach after a stressful workday.", "Guess what? A brand-new coffee shop is about to open just down the street! I'm crossing my fingers that they offer an exciting and diverse menu because, let's be honest, most places only serve coffee and Danish. Speaking of which, you're not a coffee drinker, are you? No wonder you find it dull when you join us for our afternoon hangouts at the usual coffee spots. Here's hoping this new place spices things up for everyone!", "Darling, guess what! Bobby and Evelyn are expecting a baby soon!\n\nReally? But I thought she couldn't conceive.\n\nSurprise! The baby is due right on my birthday.\n\nWhat an incredible coincidence! Bobby must be over the moon. He's always wanted kids.\n\nAbsolutely, they're both thrilled. Evelyn keeps daydreaming about what the baby will look like, being half American and half Chinese.\n\nOh, that explains why they wanted to visit us. The anticipation is so exciting! Do they know if it's a boy or a girl?\n\nIt's still a mystery. Evelyn is only three months along, but she's already started her maternity leave.", "That concert was absolutely amazing!\nI couldn't agree more.\nThe band used to be a huge sensation.\nIt's incredible how well they performed!", "I have tickets to see The Phantom of the Opera this Friday night.

I completely understand how that feels.", "Hello, is this David?\nHi, Jenny. Yes, it's David.\nHey, what's going on?\nNot a lot. My girlfriend just broke up with me.", "That's a sweet ride! What did the dealer charge you for it?\nA hefty sum. I'll probably be working extra jobs for life, but it's worth it. Hop in. Let's take it for a spin.\nAlright, let's speed up! Wow! This thing really picks up speed quickly.\nWatch this when I hit the brakes suddenly. It can come to a stop in no time.", "Robert is advancing in age. I am quite concerned about his health.", "Which church do you go to?\nI\u2019m Mormon, so I attend the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nHow is it different from other churches?\nMormons believe that after Jesus and his Apostles died, the original church became corrupt and lost its authority. In 1830, God called a prophet named Joseph Smith to restore the church.", "Apologies for my tardiness to the meeting today; I encountered heavy traffic on the way.", "Hey there! What are you reading in the newspaper?\nHey! I was tired from studying, so I decided to relax with the newspaper. But the news is so depressing. There\u2019s been another murder downtown. I can\u2019t believe the police haven\u2019t caught the killer yet.\nPeople are getting really scared. Everyone will breathe a sigh of relief when they finally catch the murderer.\nYou mean \u201cif\u201d they catch the murderer. I\u2019m terrified of going downtown at night.\nThere has to be some good news in the paper. I can\u2019t believe nothing made you happy or excited.\nActually, there was one good piece of news. Do you remember the local girl who was dying from a rare blood disease?\nYeah, her parents were raising money for her treatment in the United States.\nWell, they\u2019ve raised the money, and she\u2019s going for treatment tomorrow.\nThat\u2019s fantastic! I\u2019m so happy for the family. They must be so relieved and excited!", "Hey Tom! Are you up for a game of bowling tonight?\nAbsolutely, that sounds awesome! When and where should we meet?\nHow about we meet at the club entrance at 6:30 PM?\nPerfect, see you then!", "Are there many idioms in English?\nYes, there are hundreds. English is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions. \nCan you give us an example?\nSure, take \"look up\" for instance. It doesn\u2019t mean to gaze at the sky or the ceiling. Instead, it means to search for and find information.", "Why did the teacher reprimand Myra in front of everyone?\nBecause Myra was caught cheating on exams and responded disrespectfully.", "Do you know where I can park?\nDo you need a place here or off campus?\nI want a space on campus.\nThere is a parking garage for students.\nWhere is it located?\nHead to the western part of the campus, and you will see it there.\nIs it crowded?", "Have you heard of the \"Love Bug\"?\nDo you mean the \"I love you\" email virus?\nYes, it's one of the most harmful computer viruses and is rumored to resurface this Valentine's Day.\nThat's terrible. Why do hackers do such things?", "Would you like to meet for lunch this Saturday?\nSorry, I'm not available. I'm busy.\nWhat's keeping you busy?\nI volunteer on the first Saturday of each month.\nWhat kind of volunteering do you do?\nI assist at the children's hospital by planning activities.", "Look, there are actual words tattooed on the fish!\nI believe they're supposed to be lucky symbols. This seems to be a trendy thing now.\nMy goodness, it's so brutal. How can people be so heartless?\nNot at all. I find these tattoos incredibly stylish and sophisticated.\nYou can't just harm a fish to satisfy the twisted desires of some people.\nSweetheart, you're overreacting. It's just an animal.\nJust an animal? It's a living being too. If you want a tattoo, go ahead and get one. That's your choice because you want it. But did anyone ever consider if the fish wanted one?", "It was a pleasure meeting you. \nI look forward to us crossing paths again. \nDefinitely, I'll reach out with a call.\nSounds great.", "Did you check out last year\u2019s sales data? It was discussed during our recent board meeting, and there's fantastic news for our shareholders.\nYes, I reviewed the numbers this morning. We\u2019re profitable again!\nWe\u2019ve achieved unprecedented sales, with outstanding growth this year. Our market share has increased to 8%, a 120% rise from the previous year. Our strategy is paying off!\nNot only did our annual sales reach a new high, but our monthly earnings also surpassed our projections. After a challenging two years, we're finally back in the positive.\nThe company's performance has improved significantly since Wallace took over as president. He\u2019s transformed our small business into a highly profitable venture. Our products are flying off the shelves.", "What a letdown. I was eager to experience Mafia culture firsthand.\nStill, it's worth the trip just to taste the Mafia's cuisine! The five-dollar tiramisu is a culinary delight.\nDoes such a thing exist?\nFortunately, yes. You're blushing!\nAm I? Well, my face does get red when I walk too fast.", "Did you earn any awards or honors during college?\nAbsolutely! I was proud to receive a scholarship three years in a row.", "The long weekend is here with Monday off for Memorial Day. It's the start of barbecue season, and we're invited to a grill party in the park tomorrow.", "Hi, Martin. I've been searching for you all morning.

Did you get into MIT?\n\nYes, I did.", "Taylor's been in the hospital for a couple of days, and it\u2019s my fault; my football moves put him there. But it's not your fault he's still there. Why are they running all those tests anyway? I'm not sure, but we can find out. I brought some crosswords to keep him busy.", "Did you catch Ally Mabel's performance last night?\nYes, I did. Did you?\nI did, and it was hilarious!\nAbsolutely, I enjoyed it thoroughly. The scene with the judge was fantastic, wasn't it?", "Attention! The tea water is about to boil over. Could you kindly extinguish the burner? My hands are currently covered in dough. \nOf course.", "Did you run into May today?\nYeah, I did. What's up with her looking so down?\nBeats me.\nI figured she'd be in a good mood.\nRight? Especially after her recent promotion.\nWho knows, maybe it\u2019s something personal.", "I don't think the teacher had the right to say that. Accusing her in front of the whole class was wrong.\n\nYou must be joking! The teacher has the right to say anything, and if she saw Myra cheating, she certainly had the right to address it.\n\nI agree she had the right to address it, but I feel it should have been done privately.\n\nYou're right. If I were the teacher, I wouldn't have done that.", "Come on in! I'm thrilled you're here \u2013 we\u2019ve been eagerly waiting for you. Am I late to the party? Looks like everyone\u2019s already having a blast.

What's bothering you?\nI lost the table tennis match yesterday.", "The band is quite good. What do you think of the music?\nIt's lovely. It's been a while since I've listened to live music. This is enjoyable.\nIn that case, can I invite you to the next dance?\nSure. But I must admit, I'm not a great dancer...\nDon't worry about it. I'm not much of a dancer either.\nYou're doing a great job dancing.\nYou dance beautifully, too.\nWhen did you learn to dance?", "In my opinion, the major environmental issue in my country is air pollution. I must say, I concur. The air quality here is significantly worse than back home, which is more agriculture-focused and less industrialized. Although we've made progress in cutting down air pollutants lately, vehicles remain a significant contributor. On the bright side, factories have improved due to stricter environmental regulations.", "I\u2019m so thrilled, mom. A new baby!\nMy very first grandchild.\nAnd my first nephew. He resembles you a lot, mom. He really does.\nDo you think so? Well, I suppose he does look a lot like me. Oh, but he has Richard\u2019s eyes.\nYes, he does have Richard\u2019s eyes. The baby resembles you more than Richard does.\nWell, children typically resemble their parents.\nThat\u2019s true. Michelle is very similar to Henry in many ways. And she is shy around new people just like he is.\nYou often enjoy comparing children to their parents.", "Have you ever been to Disney World?\nWhen I was young, my parents took me to the one in California. I always forget \u2014 is that one Disneyland or Disney World?\nThe one in Florida is Disney World, and the one in California is Disneyland, so you must have been to Disneyland.\nThat's right. Why do you ask?\nWell, I've never been to either, and I was thinking of going to Disney World for my honeymoon.\nWhen are you getting married?\nSometime next year. We haven't set the date yet.\nCongratulations! I had no idea.\nThank you. So what do you think? Would we have a good time?\nDo you like amusement parks?\nMostly, yes. Some of the rides are a bit too scary for me, though.", "Do you speak French?\nYeah, but not very well.\nCan you understand your Spanish teacher?\nKind of. How well do you understand Mr. Wang, your Chinese teacher?\nMaybe 40 percent, if he speaks slowly. When he talks fast, I only catch a few words. But Mr. Wang is an excellent Chinese teacher. Thanks to him, my Chinese is improving a lot.", "You look better today. How did your test go?\nMuch better than yesterday.\nDid you pass?\nI not only passed but aced it! I'm so happy!\nYou should be. You worked really hard preparing for it.\nThanks for helping me. Without your encouragement, I wouldn't have passed.\nYou don't have to thank me. It's my job as your counselor.\nDid you always do well at school?", "May I borrow your CDs for our school dance?\nWow, that's quite a request!\nI promise to take personal care of each one and return them in perfect condition.\nHow about this: your class can rent them from me for the night, and you can pay for any that get damaged.\nThat sounds reasonable. It's still cheaper than hiring a live band.\nBut a live band would be so much more exciting!\nUnfortunately, our class doesn't have enough budget for that. We've already looked into it.", "Would you like to go to the beach tonight?\nSure, which one?\nI was thinking about Malibu Beach.\nI prefer Santa Monica.\nThe water there seems pretty dirty.\nI enjoy the pier at Santa Monica.\nI agree, especially because the pier is stunning at night.\nIs Malibu Beach nice?\nIt's much nicer, and I really prefer it.", "The world faces a lot of environmental problems today.

You used to hate cooking!\n\nYeah, I did, but now I actually love it.\n\nWhen did that happen?\n\nAfter I tried French food. Before that, I was always making boring stuff for my family.\n\nThat's wild! Did you go to cooking school?\n\nYep, I went to California to study.\n\nSeriously? How long were you there?\n\nFrom '88 to '90.\n\nWhat did you do after that?", "Hey Susan,\n\nYou're invited! I hope you and Frank can make it to our housewarming party this weekend.\n\nWait, a housewarming party?\nYes, Deborah and I just bought a new home in Woodlawn!\n\nCongrats! That's amazing news.

Actually, there\u2019s nothing good playing right now. How about we do something different? Want to go to a concert instead? \n\nSure, I\u2019d love to.

We heard you weren't feeling well and came to check on you.", "You don't seem happy. What's wrong?\nOh, it's nothing major.

Is your mother still upset?\nNo, my mother confirmed that the wedding will be held at home on the 2nd. Let us trust that this date is indeed auspicious, as your mother believes.\nIt will be. Today is also fortuitous. I have spoken with the airlines...\nAre they reinstating our seats?\nNo, they are providing us with discounted tickets for a honeymoon package in...\nHawaii? My ideal honeymoon destination?\nPrecisely. We will depart directly from Texas.\nOh, Jack! That's excellent news!", "As the world evolves, family structures shift too. Nowadays, people prefer smaller families with two parents and one child, known as a nuclear family.", "What happened?", "John dates her seven times a week. Maybe he's fallen for her.", "I heard that my friend Joe has been speaking negatively about me, which is quite disappointing. However, I find it hard to believe that Joe would do such a thing. It's important not to jump to conclusions too quickly. I think it would be best to speak with him directly to clarify the situation.", "Hey, Loans, how\u2019s it going this morning?\nHey, Mr. Smith, doing well.\nI\u2019ve got to hand it to you; you\u2019ve been really dedicated.\nThanks a lot, Mr. Smith.

We're really proud of your effort, Loans.\nI appreciate you saying that.", "I've visited most of Europe, several Asian countries including China, Japan, Korea, and Thailand, as well as the United States and Canada. \n\nHaven't you been to Australia?\nNo, but I'm planning to visit Australia and New Zealand soon. I've heard they're beautiful. \n\nWhich is the most beautiful country you've been to?\nNorway. It has picturesque fjords, waterfalls, and mountains.\n\nIsn't it really cold there?\nThe north is almost always cold, but the south can be fairly warm in summer. It's a wet country, with snow almost everywhere in winter.", "Welcome to my birthday celebration. I am delighted that you could attend.\nThank you for the invitation. Here is a gift for you. Happy Birthday, Francis! Wishing you many more happy and healthy years.\nThank you! Shall I open it now?\nYes, please do.", "Did you see the news about China\u2019s property prices rising the fastest in 18 months in December, raising fears of a property market bubble?\nNo. Does the newspaper explain why that happened?\nYes, it mentions that the increase was due to a rush of purchases in the fourth quarter, expecting tighter regulations.\nI believe the government should take steps to cool down the market.\nAgreed. The increasing property prices are causing problems for Chinese residents.", "I believe that celebrities have an enviable lifestyle. They are wealthy, enabling them to purchase nearly anything their hearts desire. Their fame ensures that they are adored by many.\n\nOn the other hand, I imagine their lives can be quite challenging. With paparazzi constantly snapping photos, invading their every move, they must grow tired of it.\n\nBut perhaps they secretly enjoy the attention. Complaining about it only seems to garner more media coverage, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nI think most celebrities aren't seeking personal publicity; they aim to promote their projects, like films.\n\nNo way! They crave personal limelight as it leads to more film offers, invites to elite parties, and even recording opportunities. Their lives appear effortless, filled with perks like free drinks at events.\n\nHowever, celebrities also have substantial expenses. Their need for millions to afford lavish homes and glamorous wardrobes is significant. Despite this, I bet many would rather wear casual attire, but fashion choices are often dictated by their managers.\n\nIt's hard for me to sympathize with celebrities. They are excessively compensated, overly ambitious, and excessively worshipped.\n\nThey deserve some respect. Their talent justifies their earnings, and they often donate to charities, helping those in need.\n\nReally? They only do charity work to attract more media attention, boosting their fame and promoting their projects further.", "Hi, what a nice surprise!\nIt's been so long! How have you been?", "Hey, Mary, stop tapping your pen. It's driving me crazy.\nFine! Then stop slurping your coffee and shouting on the phone!", "The weather in Beijing is absolutely stunning! Autumn truly shines here, don't you think? Absolutely, I can see why you'd say that. The oppressive heat of summer has dissipated, and the harsh chill of winter is still a distant thought.

Do you prefer free sketch or the detailed, claborate-style?\"\n\"I lean towards free sketch, especially the landscape paintings. They always bring me a sense of peace and harmony.\"\n\"Absolutely. Chinese art emphasizes the balance between humanity and nature, a cornerstone of traditional Chinese culture.\"", "The weather is awful, isn't it? It stopped snowing, but it's even colder. Look at the ice hanging from the eaves and the snow-covered streets. Do you know today's temperature? I missed the weather forecast. It feels like it's at least ten degrees below zero. I don't mind the cold, but I hate when it gets slippery. The ice will soon be thick enough for skating. I love winter sports.", "\"Nick, it\u2019s so sweet of you to see me off!\"\n\n\"Of course!
