And we have so much in common. We like the same team, music, and most amazingly, we both love Chinese food! I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends.\nIt seems you two are a good match. What qualities do you look for in a friend?\nThere's nothing definite I think. I don't have a list or anything, but when I first meet somebody, I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend. It seems I have radar helping me spot new friends.\nWell, that's something I've never heard of. But if you ask me what I value most in a friend, I would say honesty.\nI agree.

How about you?\nI'm no better than them. They say it's mindless to sit in front of a machine all the time, but I think it's stimulating.\nYou won't play online games full of violence, will you?\nOnce in a while.\nIt's no good.

The stir fry my wife made was really hearty, with chunks of beef and slivers of bell peppers and onion...\nWhat? You call that a stir fry? More meat than vegetables?

  "Han Maimed, What's your plan for the weekend?\nI plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it. To tell you the truth, I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school. It’s better to get to know it. What about you?\nI get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays.\nOh, my God! John, I didn’t know you are religious. You just look like a scientific kook, like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory.\nCome on, Han Maimed, don’t make a fuss. A lot of Americans, including many scientists, believe in religion.\nBut I’m really surprised. I thought science and religion are not compatible, are they?\nYes, they are compatible. Actually, the U. S. is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world.\nI've heard about it a little bit before, but I don’t understand. How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist?\nThat’s a little complicated. You’ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U. S. history later on. Religion was and is a part of American people’s life. Guess what? Even Harvard University, which is a highly academic institution, is in a sense the product of religion.\nReally?\nAbsolutely! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England.\nWhy was it founded by the Puritans? Where were the atheistic educators?\nBecause most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans.\nHow come? I mean why most of them were religious people?\nThat’s because in the 16th and 17th century, there was a series of religious reforms in England. Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries.\nSo, you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England?\nYes, that's why Puritans moved to the New World, where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans. Later on, it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College.\nWhy did they want to found a college?\nMany Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England. They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well.\nOh, I see.\nActually Harvard was first named'New College', without a formal name.\nWhen did it begin to be called Harvard University?\nIn 1639, it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard. Interestingly, JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman.\nIt seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion.\nTherefore, it’s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion, there would note Harvard.\nWow, I didn’t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history.\nReligion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U. S.\nI finally begin to get to know Harvard. It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor. I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard.\nRemember that Harvard is a part of the United States. So you have to know the U. S. history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard. The two are closely related.\nThat’s right. I have a lot to learn from you.",

It’s all math, really, arcs, curves, velocity, cool stuff.\nYeah, yeah, but today’s lesson was all about the creation of the universe.\nA physics class about the creation of the universe? That’s some pretty unscientific language there. Sounds more religious to me.\nIt’s all religion. Take the theory of the Big Bang.How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion? That’s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff.\nTurtles? Whatever... Look, all that’s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles. At least, that’s what the math says.",

It’s great being in a class of international students!\nMine was ok, except that no one in my class speaks English. I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve a lot this semester.\nThat’s both fortunate and unfortunate. It’s the United Nations in my class!

They must get sick of it.\nI bet they love it really. Sure, they complain about it, but that just gets them more publicity, doesn’t it?\nI think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves. They only want it for their films.\nNo way! They want publicity for themselves, so that they get invited to make more films, go to lots of cocktail parties, and even make albums! They have such an easy life. They don’t even pay for drinks when they go to a cocktail party.\nShow biz stars have plenty of expenses. That’s why they need so much money. They need million of dollars to buy big, seclude houses and wonderful dresses. I bet most show biz stars would prefer to wear jeans and a t-shirt, but they can’t because their managers force them to wear clothes they don’t like.\nI don’t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars. They’re overpaid, over-ambitious, and over-adored.\nI think you should give them some credit. They’re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn. They even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves.\nCome on! They only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves 。",

What kind of Chinese painting do you prefer, free sketch or claborate-style painting?\nI prefer free sketch, especially the landscape paintings. I can always feel peace and harmony from those landscape paintings.\nThat's true. Chinese art stresses the harmony between man and nature, which is an important part of China's traditional culture.",
