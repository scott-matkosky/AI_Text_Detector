Conversely, the women's division has been expanded to include six weight classes, an increase from the five previously offered.", "In the early years of artistic gymnastics at the Olympic Games, many athletes had a strong foundation in ballet, which helped them develop the necessary strength, flexibility, and technique. Typically, these gymnasts would reach their prime performance years in their 20s. However, this trend shifted dramatically with the historic performances of Nadia Comaneci and Nelli Kim at the 1976 Montreal Olympics. At just 14 years old, they became the first gymnasts to score a perfect 10, marking the beginning of an era dominated by younger champions. These young athletes were specifically trained in gymnastics from a very young age, often starting as early as 5 or 6 years old. Today, the Olympic Games have implemented a rule requiring gymnasts to be at least 16 years old to compete, ensuring a safer and more mature environment for these elite athletes.", "Get ready for the ultimate adrenaline rush! BMX racing is the youngest and most electrifying cycling discipline, where eight fearless riders clash on a heart-stopping track packed with pulse-pounding jumps, razor-sharp bends, and treacherous obstacles.

The first civilian skiing competitions emerged in the 1840s in northern and central Norway. A pivotal moment came in 1868 when Norway hosted its first national skiing competition in Christiania (now Oslo), won by Sondre Norheim, marking the beginning of a new era of skiing fervor. Over the next few decades, the sport gained popularity, spreading to the rest of Europe and the United States, where miners organized skiing competitions to pass the time during winter. The first slalom competition was pioneered by Sir Arnold Lunn in 1922 in M\u00fcrren, Switzerland.", "The ancient Olympic Games featured the stadium race as its inaugural event, a 192-meter sprint that has been a cornerstone of athletics since its inception.

This dominance is underscored by Australia's impressive record of winning three consecutive T20 World Cups, as well as securing four out of the last seven one-day World Cups, a testament to the team's unwavering excellence and consistency on the international stage.", "Did you know that softball pitchers have a unique way of throwing the ball? They're required to throw underhand, and most use the windmill pitch style, where they rotate their arm in a large circle before releasing the ball. The result is impressive - top female pitchers can throw the ball at speeds of over 100km/h! This fast pace fits perfectly with the quick nature of the game. Plus, the shorter pitching distance and closer bases make for a more action-packed experience. And, unlike baseball, softball games are shorter, lasting only seven innings instead of nine.", "BMX racing quickly won over fans with its high-octane action at a budget-friendly price tag, and it wasn't long before it became a sensation, particularly in California.

In East Siberia, for instance, skiers used a unique thin board with a vertical four-hole binding, sometimes even adding a layer of fur for extra grip. Meanwhile, the Lapps developed a horizontal stem-hole binding that would later inspire the design of present-day cross-country skis. By recognizing the contributions of these lesser-known ski cultures, we can gain a deeper appreciation for the rich and varied history of skiing.", "The inaugural T20 internationals took place the following year, and with the advent of the Indian Premier League (IPL) and other innovations, the 20-over-a-side format has emerged as the most popular form of cricket, drawing top talent from around the world to participate in various leagues.", "In the event of a tie after four quarters, a five-minute overtime period is added.

Once a player stops dribbling, they cannot start again. Instead, they must pass the ball to a teammate or attempt a shot. If a player tries to run with the ball without dribbling, it's considered a \"travelling\" violation, resulting in the other team gaining possession. Additionally, both the ball and the player holding it must stay within the court boundaries during play. If a player steps out of bounds or touches the line with their foot while holding the ball, the opposing team will be awarded possession."]
