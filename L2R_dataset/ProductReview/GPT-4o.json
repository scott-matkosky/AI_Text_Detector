["If you choose to dine here, be prepared for a culinary journey that spans around 2 hours from start to finish. We've given it numerous tries, hoping each visit would capture the magic of its other New Jersey locations, where we\u2019ve consistently enjoyed great experiences. The food here is undeniably delicious, but the painstakingly long wait for it to arrive can be quite the patience test. While the youthful waitstaff brings a burst of pleasant energy, their service often leaves us lingering far too long. Consequently, on weekends, we usually find ourselves gravitating towards other diners or restaurants where our meals come out more swiftly.", "Over the years, I've taken many spin classes, and none compare to those at Body Cycle. The clean space, exceptional bikes, and engaging instructors create an unparalleled workout experience. The online scheduling system is particularly helpful for busy individuals, allowing easy planning without the hassle of long waiting lists common at many gyms.\n\nA special shout out goes to Russell, the owner of Body Cycle. His passion for fitness and cycling is evident, as is his commitment to his clients' success. He frequently visits classes to offer encouragement and welcomes feedback from everyone. Russell\u2019s contagious enthusiasm and ever-present smile make every class, even the most challenging ones, thoroughly enjoyable.", "Visited a family-owned diner and opted for the buffet. It offered an interesting variety: a sizable chicken leg, crispy fried jalape\u00f1o, a tamale, two rolled grape leaves, and some fresh melon. Everything was delicious. They had a multitude of Mexican dishes available. Their menu also features all-day breakfast options. The staff was friendly and attentive. It's a great spot for a casual and relaxed meal with no fuss. Conveniently located beside the Clarion Hotel.", "The exterior might not be the most inviting, and we almost skipped it, but stepping inside was a fantastic decision! What a delightful experience \u2013 a truly varied and flavorful menu. We were particularly impressed with the lamb curry and korma. Plus, there are 10 different kinds of naan to choose from! Definitely worth a visit if you're looking for something different and delicious.", "Charming interior and friendly owner (?) provided a tour of the soon-to-be-open patio/rooftop space, which will be perfect for lovely days like today. The cheese curds were delicious and quite filling. I appreciated that the sandwiches came with a salad, especially after indulging in so many curds! I had the onion, gruyere, and tomato sandwich. It had a good amount of cheese, but I felt it needed something extra, perhaps pepper jelly. I would love to see more menu options, like salads with unique cheeses. There's a wide selection of beer and wine as well as a few cocktails. Next time, I'll definitely try one of the draft wines.", "As a loyal, long-time customer, I was shocked when my take-out order for three appetizers was refused because they were \"too busy\"\u2014despite the place being half empty. I'm a generous tipper, and this treatment is unacceptable. I'll be taking my business to Kanella from now on! I won't be returning to Dmitris.", "I absolutely loved this tour! The Groupon deal made it an excellent value. As a first-time visitor to New Orleans with little knowledge of its history, this was the perfect introduction. Our tour guide shared fascinating insights about the city, making the experience thoroughly enjoyable. I initially expected to only tour the cemetery, but we spent the first hour exploring the French Quarter and the second hour in the cemetery, which was a fantastic surprise. We met in front of a grocery store\u2014easy to find and convenient for grabbing water. There was also a stop at a visitor center for a bathroom break. This tour was a highlight of my trip and comes highly recommended!", "Incredibly delicious wings paired with homemade bleu cheese. Tried the ribeye, which was tender, impeccably cooked, and flavorful. Great variety of craft beers available. Highly recommend discovering this hidden treasure.", "This Easter, instead of going to Lopez Lake, we visited Los Padres National Forest. The forest is really beautiful, but if you go to White Rock, you'll notice that the staff needs to cut down all the dead grass that covers the rock and the surrounding water. It would be great if they could clean up or remove the dead grass along the water's edge as well. The water itself looks quite green and dirty. The staff at Los Padres National Forest really need to put in more effort to keep the forest looking nice and not like a mess. Even Cachuma Lake seems better maintained.", "Our group of six dined here for hibachi. Disappointingly, our waitress delivered our individual sushi orders on a single plate, making it challenging to distinguish whose order was whose. Moreover, several items were omitted from an order. Considering the restaurant was notably quiet, these mistakes were unexpected. Typically, hibachi dining is an engaging and lively experience; however, our cook, Francisco, spoke only a few words, despite his excellent cooking skills. The service was subpar, though the food quality was satisfactory. I hope this was an isolated incident, but given the cost, I wouldn't consider returning.", "My experience with Shalimar was exceptional. I needed my engagement ring resized and was informed over the phone that it could likely be done within the day. When I brought it in, the team confirmed that the jeweler could accommodate my same-day request, estimating the cost at around $40 for a simple band adjustment (decreased by three full sizes). \n\nI double-checked my size, confirmed, and left the ring with them. Later that afternoon, I came to pick it up and found it too small. It's crucial to note that Shalimar sized the ring perfectly according to my instructions, but I had made an error and should have gone up a half-size.\n\nThe Shalimar staff were incredibly understanding and accommodating, resizing the ring back up and returning it to me within an hour at no additional charge, despite my mistake. Their empathetic and professional response to what was quite an embarrassing situation instantly earned my satisfaction and loyalty as a customer. I am very grateful for such a wonderful experience.", "Locals recommended Milktooth, and it's an amazing jewel of Indianapolis. I'm glad I had the chance to experience this.", "I absolutely love coming here for happy hour or dinner! The patio is fantastic with fans to keep you cool in the StL heat. The staff are super accommodating at this location. I personally enjoy the Veal Milanese with mixed greens instead of pasta, and they're happy to customize the menu to suit your taste!", "The food was excellent\u2014I particularly enjoyed the gnocchi with marinara sauce, and the baked eggplant appetizer was also very tasty. Although the service was very slow, I would still return because the food is that good.", "The bun is what makes the Sonoran Dog special. It's like a cozy blanket for the hot dog. At first, it seems excessive, just like the popular blanket with sleeves\u2014too soft, too squishy, too indulgent. But it\u2019s not. The bun is warm, soft, chewy, and fragrant, and it excels where other Sonoran Dogs fall short. The hot dog itself is tasty, though I wish the hot dog or the bacon had more crunch to stand up better to the strong flavors of the mustard and onions. I'm a fan of the carne asada caramelo, too. It has an excellent tortilla, salty, melty cheese, and great carne. Plus, it's super cheap and available at the drive-through.", "Fantastic breakfast spot! Indulged in the most perfectly fluffy waffle and delightfully crispy home fries. The friendly waitstaff made the experience even better. Can't wait to return!", "Exceptional service (special commendation to Douglas) that perfectly complemented the delectable cuisine. Although it is a rather expensive establishment (with main courses averaging $40-50), it justifies this pricing with an atmosphere comparable to any of the premier restaurants nationwide.", "My husband and I have dined here several times, and each visit has been delightful. The entire staff, from the servers to the bartender, is well-versed in the menu and could quickly suggest dishes that I could enjoy as-is, modify, or omit ingredients to accommodate my Celiac dietary needs. The selection of wines and cocktails is exceptional, and the food is absolutely delicious. My only minor complaint is the lack of a gluten-free dessert option, which means we usually go somewhere else for a sweet treat. Nonetheless, this doesn\u2019t diminish our enthusiasm for returning again and again.", "I go to Blow Bar to get my eyebrows done by Natalie, who is a brows specialist and highly recommended. She does an amazing job on my brows! I also got a blowout from Victoria and was totally impressed. I have thin, straight, lifeless hair, and she gave me the most volume I\u2019ve ever had! I tried another stylist once, but I didn\u2019t love it as much, so Victoria is now my go-to. The place is also very clean and beautiful!", "This cafe is, without a doubt, my absolute favorite in the entire city. Their black and white latte stands out as the finest I have ever tasted, striking a perfect balance with its subtle sweetness and ideal amount of foam. The soups they serve are consistently outstanding, so much so that even those who typically do not enjoy soup will find them delightful. Additionally, the ample space available makes it an ideal spot for getting work done. The noise level is meticulously maintained at just the right volume, and the music contributes to a perfect ambiance. One of the highlights for me is seeing patrons bring their dogs, which always adds a touch of warmth to the atmosphere. I am committed to patronizing this wonderful establishment for as long as possible.", "Amazingly delicious frozen custard with actual pumpkin pie bits, including pie crust chunks. Why hasn't this become a national hit? Super yummy!", "Upland Brewery, hailing from Bloomington, Indiana, has garnered such a following that they've expanded to several locations across central Indiana. Renowned for their exceptional beers, as well as their mouth-watering burgers and tenderloins, Upland has set a high standard. Naturally, I was eager to sample their pizza. However, my experience left much to be desired. The margherita pizza featured a cracker-like crust and was rather insubstantial. While the cheese was of high quality, the other toppings were underwhelming in flavor, and surprisingly, it lacked the traditional red sauce that defines a classic margherita pizza. In my view, Upland's pizza might make for a decent appetizer shared among friends, but I'll be sticking with their exemplary burgers or tenderloins for my main course on future visits.", "I absolutely loved the show! It was the perfect way to unwind and kick off the weekend.", "Sure, here is a rephrased version:\n\nIndeed, this is the sole sushi restaurant in town. Nevertheless, it's perfect for satisfying your sushi cravings when you're short on time to go elsewhere. The salmon is likely their top choice, which is why we consistently order it. Additionally, we are fond of their spicy edamame, tempura, ocean salad, and cabbage salad. The service has always been friendly and efficient!", "I was torn between giving this 3 or 4 stars. I absolutely adore the 96th Street Naked Tchopstix, so I was thrilled to see this closer-to-home branch. However, the vibe here is quite different, leaning more towards takeout despite having a sizable dining area. You place your order at the counter, and they bring it to you.\n\nMy daughter and I went for the sushi bowl. The ordering process is simple: pick up a piece of paper and select your preferred proteins, vegetables, rice, and toppings. I appreciate this method since it avoids the confusion and noise of speaking to the server directly. The sushi bowl was good overall, though not exceptional. The vegetable options felt limited, and the rice portion overshadowed the other ingredients. The sauces, however, were delicious.\n\nMy husband had the Maui roll, which is my favorite at the 96th Street location, but it didn\u2019t quite measure up here. It was good, just not as high-quality or consistent as what I'm used to. Nonetheless, I\u2019d return, and I believe many people would enjoy the sushi bowls.\n\nI also want to address the low service reviews. Remember, this is a sushi place, not a fast-food joint like McDonald\u2019s. It\u2019s naturally a bit slower, and you won\u2019t be in and out in five minutes, even though it\u2019s labeled \"express.\" As a healthier alternative to fast food in the area, I find it worth the wait.\n\nOh, and definitely try the bubble tea. I had the strawberry, and it was quite delicious. Next time, I\u2019m eager to try the vanilla chai.", "Had lunch and enjoyed a beef brisket sandwich that was incredibly juicy and tender. The pulled pork was equally delicious!", "This place has the best Thai food around! Everything tasted genuinely authentic and super delicious. I'll definitely be coming back often!", "The service was poor and the food was average. I regret not choosing a different place for my final dinner in town.", "I recently dined here with my wife over the weekend and was thoroughly impressed! Our meal was fantastic! We were amazed by the speedy service and how quickly our food arrived. Everything tasted fresh and homemade, which we both loved. The only challenge was choosing from the menu because there were so many tempting options. We will definitely be back to try more dishes! Excited to see what the next chef specials will be!", "I have to give this restaurant at least two stars for the decent food. However, during a dinner meeting where I spent $100 on entr\u00e9es and appetizers, I had to flag down the assistant cook (the guy in bright red baggy pants watching TV) to ask for more avocado for my tuna entr\u00e9e. He made it clear he couldn't help and said I needed to ask my waitress so she could charge me $4 for the avocado.", "My first visit was outstanding! The atmosphere is welcoming, as if you're entering someone's home. The waitstaff are both humorous and friendly. The food was served promptly and tasted phenomenal. I will definitely be returning.", "Great burgers, fries, and salad! The burgers have a nice hint of salt and pepper. This place is super charming, though they only offer outdoor seating. The staff is really friendly. There's street parking and a lot in the back too.", "The staff here is incredibly helpful and unfailingly friendly. The store is immaculate and spacious, consistently stocked with all the essentials. They even go above and beyond to craft my custom breakfast bagel to perfection!", "A few years ago, I brought my vehicle to this place for some work due to a manufacturer recall. They successfully resolved the initial problem, but afterwards, I started hearing another noise that I assumed was related. It turned out to be an entirely different issue. Kevin and his mechanic promptly hoisted my car and fixed the new problem at no cost, despite my offer to pay. Their exceptional service and generosity truly impressed me. I highly recommend them!", "Following my Review of the Day yesterday of another Sweet CeCe's location, I realized I hadn't reviewed my usual spot! Anyway, I'm a huge fan of their product \u2013 absolutely love it. Their topping selection is usually fantastic, offering a good balance between healthy and indulgent options. Occasionally, the staff can be inattentive or hard to find, and sometimes you need to remind them about promotions like $5 Friday. Despite these issues, I can't rate it less than 4 stars because I just adore it so much.", "What a fantastic addition to the Funk Zone! Enjoy a bite and some tastings\u2014life is good. Conveniently located right next door to the Santa Barbara Wine Collective, it even shares the same tables. We indulged in a fabulous savory croissant.", "A great spot to unwind and get a massage! It\u2019s super easy to snag a same-day appointment, and I\u2019ve always been happy with every therapist I\u2019ve seen there!", "We arrived for check-in at approximately 2:30 pm. The process was swift and uncomplicated, complemented by the generous provision of complimentary valet parking, which we greatly appreciated. The Peppermill Resort is vast, evoking the grandeur of Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. It boasts around eight diverse restaurants that cater to nearly every culinary craving imaginable. The casino area is expansive, on par with some of the largest in Las Vegas. However, we did notice a deceptive practice: many slot machines were labeled as penny machines, yet the minimum bets ranged from 30 cents to $5, which felt misleading.\n\nWe stayed in the Tuscany Tower on the 12th floor, where our room offered a pleasant view of the extensive pool area. The room itself was spacious and included a variety of amenities such as complimentary WiFi, a sizable bathroom with a large shower equipped with two shower heads, a television, a large jetted bathtub, and a convenient phone next to the commode. The bathroom also featured dual sinks and ample counter space, along with a generous supply of towels. The main living area was roomy, furnished with a king bed, nightstands, a closet, a second television, a mini-fridge, a dresser with two drawers, a safe, a table suitable for a computer or writing, complimentary bottles of water, and three well-upholstered chairs along with a table. The thermostat was effective at maintaining a comfortable temperature. \n\nThroughout our stay, we found the staff to be courteous and helpful. Overall, the facilities and service contributed to a very enjoyable experience.", "My boyfriend and I visited this deli for the first time today. I enjoyed a turkey, avocado, and bacon panini, while he had a buffalo chicken wrap. We will definitely be coming back. The wait for food was reasonable, which is always a plus during lunch hour. The menu had an impressive variety with salads, soups, macaroni, sandwiches, and hot dishes. I love a deli with so many choices!", "Incredible biscuits and (fill in the blank) that will blow your mind! The cocktails are top-notch as well. Absolutely a must-visit! Just be prepared for a lively crowd.", "The food was excellent, and the atmosphere and decor resemble a fishing lodge. The menu is somewhat a mix between Outback and Bonefish. We visited using a Groupon, and all three of our meals along with the calamari appetizer were cooked perfectly. We will definitely return.", "The restaurant feels cheap and tastes cheap. \n\nThe Good:\n- Cheap prices\n- Convenient location\n- Edible desserts\n- Varied food selection: baked and fried chicken, mashed potatoes, salad bar, meat and cheese bar, ravioli, pizza\n- Excellent waitress\n\nThe Meh:\n- Meat slicing station\n- Not deveined shrimp\n- Mexican station\n\nThe Bad:\n- Breakfast: worst eggs, uncuttably tough ham and English muffins (tried 3 times)\n- Steak and shrimp below par\n- Breaded items are unappetizing\n- Outdated 1970s decor\n\nTried three times and was disappointed each time.", "I almost gave this restaurant a 5-star rating, but one pretentious waiter held me back. As a guest at Hotel Palomar for four nights, I found the restaurant's location very convenient. On my first night, a coworker and I decided to have cocktails there. The host staff was busy when we arrived, so we just seated ourselves at a small table near the bar since the restaurant wasn\u2019t too crowded.\n\nA waiter approached, and I quickly asked if it was okay for us to sit there and explained we were only having cocktails. He responded rather rudely and walked away mid-sentence, not making us feel welcome at all. Despite this, we tried to enjoy our time but got a strong vibe that he couldn't be bothered with us. When we asked to split the bill due to company policy, he acted as if we asked for something unreasonable. We left, shocked by his rudeness.\n\nAlthough that experience was off-putting and we initially decided to avoid the restaurant on subsequent nights, we gave it another try the next evening. This time, we carefully checked that the waiter from the previous night wasn\u2019t on duty. We sat at the bar and were immediately welcomed by the bartender, who could not have been more different. I believe his name was Ben, and he was absolutely fantastic! Friendly, knowledgeable, and genuinely interested in making our experience great, Ben taught us about whiskey, classic cocktails, and more. He completely turned around our perception of the place.\n\nI also tried room service from the restaurant, and it did not disappoint. The bacon-wrapped dates and chocolate cake were incredible! Overall, the restaurant is great, and the bartender(s) truly stand out. It\u2019s a shame one bad experience almost ruined it for us, but Ben made all the difference.", "After enjoying a Sunday morning walk in the park, I decided to stop by this place. The food was exceptional, the coffee was superb, and the customer service was outstanding. The overall vibe in here is absolutely delightful, adding to a wonderful experience.", "In a word... \"OVERRATED!\". The food took forever. My burger was way overcooked (I asked for Medium Rare) and the Seafood Jumbalaya was just okay. Definitely not worth the price. There are better spots to eat in the French Quarter. It wasn't horrible, but with all the hype, I expected a lot more.", "The accommodations provided a remarkably comfortable bed, an excellent breakfast, swift internet connectivity, an ideal location, and competitive pricing. Overall, my impressions of this establishment were exceedingly favorable. However, it is worth noting that guests staying on the upper floors might experience delays of up to 15 minutes for elevator service during the morning hours.", "NEVER AGAIN. This establishment fails to meet the basic expectations of a restaurant, aside from merely preparing food; patrons are left to handle everything else. If you desire water, you must fetch it yourself from across the yard. Interested in a drink? You'll need to walk up a flight of stairs and pay in cash. The seating consists of dirty lawn chairs in an unkempt yard. The wait staff offers minimal assistance, delivering your food only after you've paid for it at the window in cash\u2014reminiscent of New Orleans Hamburger and Seafood, but with inferior cleanliness and the added presence of live music, which is at least a pleasant touch. This was a once-in-a-lifetime experience for me\u2014just once.", "If you prefer paying for everything a la carte, this place is for you. The food was not terrible but not impressive either. They initially brought a basket of chips and tomato sauce. I asked for something spicier and some pico de gallo, which they provided happily. The salsa was much better. When I asked for a Coke, they brought a bottle, and I specified I wanted the fountain drink. She informed me that only Pepsi was available on tap, without mentioning Coke was only in bottles.\n\nWe ordered reasonably priced food, but were informed that cheese on the taco would cost extra. It was also $2.50 for an additional basket of chips. Upon receiving the bill, we noticed we paid more for condiments than for the actual food: sour cream was $2, pico de gallo $2.50, salsa $2, chips $2.50, cheese $1, and the bottled Coke we didn't want was $5. Just a suggestion: when ordering, always ask if there is an extra charge.", "The cafe exuded charm. Arriving at 8 am, we were pleasantly surprised by a live jazz band serenading us. I opted for the breakfast sandwich, which was a delightful choice. The egg was skillfully rolled with bacon bits tucked inside. For a hearty meal, it was an excellent value!", "On a scale of one to awesome, this place is phenomenal. Attracted by the promise of duck-fat French fries, I took my son here for his birthday. We put our name on the waitlist, enjoyed a drink around the corner, and were seated at the bar in about 45 minutes. Keith, the bartender, was friendly, knowledgeable about his whiskeys, and an all-around great guy. We started with Cape May Salts (two for me, one for my son) and tater tots, both of which were delightful. I had the Kentucky Fried Quail for dinner, which was outstanding, though the succotash was a bit underwhelming. My son ordered the $24 Foie Gras burger, which was incredible and worth every penny. While the duck-fat fries were tasty, they weren't the highlight of the meal. The cheese sauce on the side was unnecessary but didn\u2019t detract from the experience. I can\u2019t wait to return and share this place with everyone I know.", "We kicked off our meal with what we thought would be a delightful artichoke dip, but boy, were we wrong. It arrived colder than a winter\u2019s day and the chips were disappointingly stale. We mentioned this to our waitress, hoping for a resolution, but sadly, nothing changed.\n\nNext, we ordered a large thin-crust pizza, which ended up being quite the wallet-drainer once we added our favorite toppings. When it finally arrived, it was just OK\u2014not the mouthwatering masterpiece we'd hoped for. \n\nDespite our server not really stepping up for us when we needed it, she was otherwise quite good at her job. I\u2019ve been to this place before, especially during Cardinals games, and it was much better back then. Unfortunately, this visit fell flat, so it looks like we\u2019ll be exploring new dining spots next time around.", "It was my fianc\u00e9's birthday, and he wanted a relaxed evening at a good Thai restaurant. Yelp led us to Jasmine Rice, and it turned out to be an excellent choice. We initially craved summer rolls, which were listed on the menu but apparently only available in the summer, so we opted for the pan-fried dumplings instead. While they had good flavor, we likely wouldn\u2019t order them again. \n\nFor our mains, we chose the green curry fried rice with duck and the chicken pad thai. Both dishes were delightful, but the duck was exceptional\u2014some of the best I\u2019ve ever tasted. The pad thai was a bit on the sweet side for our liking, so we might try a different noodle dish next time, although it was still quite tasty, especially with a touch of chili sauce.\n\nOur service was commendable, though we noticed other diners had some issues. One table, in a hurry to catch a show at the Kimmel Center, had a lengthy wait for their meal and risked being late. Another take-out customer was missing an item, but the owner went above and beyond by personally delivering the dish to their home. \n\nAll in all, Jasmine Rice offers quality Thai food, and we look forward to returning.", "I can't get enough of Courtney! She\u2019s hands down the BEST hairstylist I\u2019ve ever had. What makes her so amazing is her knack for knowing exactly what suits me, plus she totally respects my style limits. Every time I walk into the salon, I just let her work her magic. No specific requests, just pure trust in her talent. And every single time, I leave completely wowed by her work! You know you've found a gem of a stylist when they can see what needs to be done without you saying a word. She's not just an incredible stylist\u2014she's got a fantastic personality and a wealth of knowledge, too. If you want to look and feel your absolute best, I can\u2019t recommend Courtney highly enough!", "During the time I lived nearby, I visited this location frequently. Although it is part of a chain and lacks a certain allure, it serves its purpose on numerous occasions. For an oil change, this place is satisfactory, and they also handle state inspections efficiently. The trick is to arrive when they aren't busy; otherwise, expect a wait. In summary, while it's nothing extraordinary\u2014a Pep Boys is a Pep Boys\u2014the service provided is generally decent.", "Replaced two old Lennox units from the 1970s with two new ones. They did an excellent job, and the new units have been running smoothly for three years now.", "I love the Brewpub for their wide range of dishes\u2014nachos, pizza, and sandwiches. They also have a great selection of beers, all brewed right there. While the service can be slow, it seems to be just the relaxed pace of the restaurant. It\u2019s not the place for a quick bite and a beer; instead, take your time to enjoy the patio and hang out with friends. The venue is kid and dog-friendly and perfect for vegetarian and vegan friends too. My go-to orders are a half order of nachos or the fish & chips. I also tried their Pumpkin Seasonal Beer, and it\u2019s definitely up there with some of my favorites.", "Looking for something farmhouse, rustic, or chic? The helpful staff here have great ideas to decorate your home, and the prices are reasonable too! They carry items from Joanna Gaines (Fixer Upper) and much more. It's so nice to finally have a good home store in SB with such great prices.", "My brother came to visit, and we decided to grab a six-pack of top-notch beers for an epic night in. We ended up hanging out, having a few, and diving into some intense Super Smash Brothers sessions on the Nintendo 64\u2014generously donated by fellow patrons! This place is amazing, with delicious food and truly awesome people. It deserves to be a Northeast legend!", "My favorite dishes are coconut soup and pad thai with protein. I tried the same menu here and actually really liked their coconut soup. They used enough coconut milk to make the soup really creamy without too many herbs. I'm used to Americanized Thai food, so I prefer fewer herbs on my dish, except for cilantro. The pad thai was great too. I liked the amount of peanuts they used, the noodles were perfect and chewy, and it wasn't too sweet. They gave me a generous amount of chicken, which wasn't dry, so I was very happy with my meal.", "Outstanding service! The diner offers fantastic food, with breakfast available all day. We visited for lunch; despite the crowd, the staff was incredibly friendly and welcoming. Conveniently located off the 295.", "My favorite place to hang out on a Saturday night! I was really bummed when Lucy\u2019s closed, but I was pleasantly surprised by this bar just across the street. Their food is better than I expected\u2014I always get the wings and fries (just be careful with the WTF sauce). Sometimes, it takes a while to get the bartender\u2019s attention since the place is usually packed. And if you\u2019re lucky, you might even see the \"It's Always Sunny\" crew pop in!", "We were a bit hesitant about trying the Shellfish Company on the Wharf because places like this (such as those on Cannery Row in Monterey) often take advantage of tourists, offering overpriced and low-quality food. However, influenced by the consistently good reviews on Yelp, we decided to give it a chance. The restaurant is small, so plan ahead. Expect a wait, or try visiting during off-peak hours. Fortunately, our wait was only about 20 minutes as the dinner rush was winding down.\n\nThe special was local rock crab - $25 for 3 lbs of California Rock Crab, salad, and your choice of soup or chowder. After seeing a few trays of rock crab served to other tables, my wife and I decided to order it since it looked delicious.\n\nThe salad and chowder were great, with generous portions. Although I enjoyed the chowder, my wife's Shrimp Bisque was amazing, and I would recommend choosing that. \n\nNow, onto the main dish: the rock crab tasted as fantastic as it looked. It had juicy, buttery chunks of white crab meat that were easy to access once the thick shells were cracked. The shells broke apart easily, indicating they were perfectly cooked. The rock crab offered a substantial amount of meat with minimal effort, making it a great choice.\n\nWe were thoroughly satisfied with our meal, and the special was a great value. Enjoying the Rock Crab at SBSC turned out to be one of the highlights of our trip. Ordering crab here is definitely a safe bet.", "I'm absolutely in love with Weaver's Way and genuinely disagree with some of the previous reviews out there. This co-op isn't designed for convenience shopping in the traditional sense, but that's precisely what makes it special. As a single woman, I have zero trouble shopping here, even during peak times. In fact, it's ideal for solo shoppers like me because I can buy smaller quantities than what you'd find at big corporate stores like Acme.\n\nI also love the work hours. Over the years, I've worked in various parts of the store, and lately, I've been involved in the membership committee, which has been incredibly rewarding. The community here is diverse and not just a bunch of \"tree huggers\" and \"earth children\"\u2014it's a vibrant mix of like-minded people from all sorts of backgrounds.\n\nOne of the highlights for me is the access to locally grown produce and preservative-free, natural foods at prices far more reasonable than Whole Foods. Plus, the sense of community is unparalleled. I thoroughly enjoy interacting with other members and feel a sense of accomplishment knowing I'm contributing to both my local and global community.\n\nBeing single, I don't find the membership fee or work hours to be a burden at all. However, I understand that co-op membership might not be for everyone, especially if you're making decisions as a family. But if you're excited about Weaver's Way values, you won't find a better place to shop. If not, you can always stick to chain stores or pay the 10% visitor\u2019s fee for occasional visits.", "Frankly, the cuisine here does not particularly impress me, although it appears to be a favorite among many others. I frequent this establishment mainly because my husband enjoys it; personally, I would prefer to patronize a different barbecue venue. Admittedly, the experience may vary depending on one's menu selections.", "For $4.99, the TV shows come with commercials\u2014talk about a tacky cash grab! It's definitely not what you'd expect from a hotel charging over $150 a night. And forget about a complimentary breakfast; instead, there's just an overpriced buffet. Even the most budget-friendly hotels in California offer free breakfast!", "I visited this shop near my hotel and was impressed by the friendly staff. The buy one get one deal is fantastic. I tried the hot wings, loaded with delicious sauce, and loved them. I'll definitely return for more pizza next time I'm in town!", "I've only tried the cannolis here, and they are amazing! They fill them fresh when you order and the filling is fantastic. It's not too sweet, just perfect. Whether you like cannolis or think you don't, you should definitely try one from Termini Bros.", "While traveling in our RV, we stopped in Granite City and discovered a great cafe. The staff was friendly and welcoming. The home-style cooking was fantastic. We ate there twice, and every dish was fresh and delicious.", "After just 3 weeks of exploring the area, I finally discovered a gem off Magazine that's not overrated! The staff here are super friendly! And you know my love for Ph\u00f2 - it's absolutely amazing!", "Absolutely! Here's the revised text:\n\n\"We were thrilled to return for breakfast with our family this weekend, and once again, the food and service were impeccable! Highly recommend!\"", "Our kayaking tour at Santa Cruz Island was absolutely fantastic! My husband and I had an incredible time. Jen, our tour guide, was both helpful and informative. We had a blast exploring the caves, and the whole experience surpassed our expectations.", "I highly recommend this place to anyone seeking a delicious meal at a reasonable price. The shrimp and goat cheese crepes are an absolute must-try!", "After living in the St. Louis area for well over a decade, I am both embarrassed and regretful to admit that I only ate here for the first time a few weeks ago. I'm embarrassed because it's a St. Louis tradition and regretful because I missed out on it for so many years! This place is incredible. What's not to love? It's a factory that offers tours (Friday-Sunday, noon to 5pm on the hour), has a shop, bar, and dining area. They also host numerous events with live music on the weekends. It's fun to wander around and explore\u2014don\u2019t worry, you'll likely have time since there often is a wait before you can dine. The beer is phenomenal; the Hefeweizen is my personal favorite and a great choice for those who aren't big beer drinkers (like myself). Additionally, the food is locally sourced and delicious. I had the pizza, recommended by my server, and it was truly outstanding\u2014even as a pizza connoisseur, I enjoyed it immensely. My date had a bison burger, which was also excellent. \n\nMore fun info: the service is fantastic! The staff tends to be more eclectic and alternative, similar to those you might find in a tattoo parlor, which I support. What makes this place stand out is its quality and focus on local food and brewing. It is a bit on the pricier side, but for the experience and quality you get, it's worth it. I will definitely be returning, and I highly recommend you do too!", "If I could give it a zero, I would. I ordered a plain hamburger and realized they put bacon in it (which I'm allergic to and can\u2019t eat) after two bites. I went back to the drive-through to complain (didn't realize the restaurant was open; it was almost 2, after all\u2026), and the guy took the burger back without saying anything and disappeared. After 2 minutes of awkwardly chatting with the people in the next car, he came back and rudely told me I had to go inside to get my food. So, I did. Still didn't get an apology. I'm not going back there after that ordeal, which is a shame because it\u2019s nice to have variety after DT. Guess I\u2019ll stick with Freebirds!", "First time here, and WOW, they did an AMAZING job! I'm absolutely thrilled with the car wash and the fantastic service I received. Thank you so much!", "I just started going to Sushi Nara this month; they opened recently. I love it there because it's clean, the staff are friendly and helpful, and the service is fast. The sushi is always delicious (I've been there 3 times), and the prices are fair. This week, my husband got takeout with 4 sushi rolls for just $24. The food is fresh with a huge variety. Everyone on the eastside should check it out!", "Fantastic little shop. The owner is exceptionally knowledgeable and clearly passionate about his work. They stock tires and other unique parts that are hard to find elsewhere.", "Visited this place numerous times and all I can express is that the cuisine is excellent. A treasure tucked away in Florissant, it boasts the finest Panang curry around. I have yet to try their sister restaurant, but I find it hard to move on when I am consistently pleased with the food here.", "My food only merited two stars, but I'll give an extra star for the appealing menu and unique design and concept. Unfortunately, the tomato-basil soup tasted like weak marinara, and the tuna melt had an overwhelmingly citrusy, off-putting flavor\u2014perhaps due to excessive lemon zest. Next time, I'll focus on dishes with cured Italian meats like mortadella and prosciutto, as well as the enticing baked goods, especially the Nutella bruschetta.", "We visited the establishment once and were considerably disappointed with both my vegetable pizza and my husband's sub sandwich. The tomato sauce lacked flavor, and there was an insufficient amount of cheese on my pizza. The dough appeared and tasted as though it had been machine-prepared. While it is possible that improvements have been made since our visit, we are not inclined to return in the near future.", "A few friends and I decided to grab some late-night milkshakes and ended up at More Than Just Ice Cream. Despite the name, we only ordered ice cream. We got three milkshakes: a coffee, a chocolate, and a black & white malt. They were all quite good and definitely satisfied our ice cream craving. However, I felt my coffee milkshake and the chocolate one could have been thicker. The black & white malt, on the other hand, had the perfect thickness and was the best of the three. Unfortunately, I didn't order that one, so I ended up with my less creamy coffee milkshake. Before settling on a milkshake, I sampled a few ice cream flavors and found the pumpkin pie flavor to be AMAZING. In hindsight, I should have just gone with that. Perhaps milkshakes aren't the best choice here.", "We celebrated my mother's 100th birthday here, and every detail exceeded our expectations. From a prime table with a stunning view to delicious chef's compliments and a beautifully decorated cake plate, the warm and attentive service made it an unforgettable experience. This celebration was truly exceptional.", "Wow! This place is fantastic. The bartender is awesome. You\u2019ve got to try the burger \u2013 it's super fresh with all local ingredients. The plates of food I saw looked amazing too. The beer is perfectly cold, and the drinks are mixed just right. It\u2019s not a chain restaurant but a wonderful local spot with great staff.", "During my 5-day stay, I frequented this restaurant four times. Unbelievable, right? Here are some reasons why:\n\n- We stayed at a nearby hotel.\n- The restaurant's hours are convenient, open from 11 AM to 10:30 PM daily, even on New Year's Day.\n- As a party of two, we were usually seated immediately.\n- Oysters are priced at $9 per dozen, which is quite a bargain!\n- There\u2019s a seafood shop next door offering both boiled and fresh seafood to go.\n- Our server, who attended to us each time, was very friendly and recognized us.\n\nHowever, here are the reasons for giving it only 3 stars:\n\n- Despite trying various items, everything was rather mediocre. The raw oysters were not well cleaned. If your schedule allows, head to Superior Seafood during their happy hour for 50-cent oysters\u2014better quality and cheaper. The turtle soup had an odd taste, so I prefer Felix's. Some of the boiled shrimp were always mushy, possibly overcooked.\n- While the ambiance is inviting, it's not particularly comfortable, so we usually just ate and left.\n- The bathrooms need cleaning!\n\nI might return if I\u2019m in the area again, or just quickly pick up some seafood to go.", "I would advise against dining at this establishment if you are seeking a satisfactory meal. Our server appeared to be quite inexperienced and disoriented, leading us to believe she was unfamiliar with the restaurant. We had to repeatedly request basic necessities such as table settings and water refills. Additionally, despite ordering chicken parmesan, we were served eggplant parmesan, which contained a fish bone. On a positive note, the beverages were well-prepared.", "TDS didn't quite meet my expectations. The restaurant has an uninviting atmosphere\u2014cold and lacking character. With no decor, menu boards, or drink machines, and dining tables made of stainless steel prep tables, it didn\u2019t feel welcoming. The abundance of unnamed staff (no uniforms or name tags) added to the impersonal vibe.\n\nWhile the food is reasonably priced and generally good, we found it frustrating that they charge for extra salsa. We had ordered a salsa trio, which came in small 2oz glass bowls. When my brother asked for additional salsa for his tacos\u2014after we ordered one of every taco, three burritos, and guacamole\u2014he was informed that he needed to purchase the trio again. Despite spending over $40 on food, drinks, and appetizers, they were still rigid about extra salsa.\n\nIn conclusion, although the food was decent, the overall experience was disappointing. I wouldn\u2019t return due to the lackluster atmosphere and the policy on extra salsa.", "I'm thrilled with our pictures! Angela Clifton Photography has worked with us three times, and we've loved every single photo. Not only are the photos amazing, but we also had a fantastic time. The price is very reasonable, and we'll cherish these pictures forever!", "I enjoyed my fish at a sidewalk table. It was a bit pricey, but the food was good. For quieter outdoor dining, try Side Street in the French Quarter.", "The courthouse is quite old and features impressive artwork. The spiral staircase is amusing. From the 5th level, you can get a view of the entire city. The tower clock room is fascinating, filled with intricate mechanical gears. You need to schedule an appointment in advance to enter the clock room. It's worth spending 2 to 3 hours here.", "I got to meet Ann today, and she was super helpful and upbeat. She went above and beyond to make my first experience here amazing. I'm definitely going to be a regular customer now. Thanks, girlie!!", "Absolutely! Here\u2019s a more enthusiastic version of your text:\n\nI tried this place for the first time and WOW, was I blown away! I ordered a combination dinner with Pad Thai and coconut soup, and let me tell you, it was amazing! The coconut soup was mouthwateringly delicious\u2014I've never had anything like it before. The Pad Thai was on point, exactly what I was hoping for, and it didn't disappoint at all. The restaurant's Thai decor and music were incredible, creating the perfect ambiance. The staff and service were absolutely top-notch. In a town with limited food options, this spot is a breath of fresh air. I think I\u2019ve found my new favorite go-to place in Carp!", "This place was an absolute oasis of relaxation and cool vibes. It's a must-return destination on my travel list. Plus, the artist's performance was a delightful and eclectic mix\u2014imagine a country twist on \"Let It Go\"! How could you not fall in love with that?", "If you haven't been to the Smoothie King Center since it was known as the New Orleans Arena, you're in for a delightful surprise. The arena has undergone a fantastic facelift! While the seats remain the same, everything else has been revitalized. \n\nMost excitingly, the food options are now incredibly diverse, catering to a variety of tastes. The quality has skyrocketed compared to previous years. And let's talk about the drinks \u2013 they've also seen a major upgrade. From full-service bars to spiked lemonades, bottled and draft beers, and of course, smoothies, there's something for everyone. \n\nGot a sweet tooth? You're in luck. There's a spot for sweets where you can indulge in funnel cake, cotton candy, and countless other delectable treats that I was too full to even try. \n\nThe venue now exudes a swanky, top-notch vibe. It's clear that we're moving on up!", "Whenever my stomach feels unsettled, I know I can rely on Chipotle's steak to make me feel better. I try to avoid the busy lunch rush and usually visit between 2 and 4 when it's more peaceful. No matter the time, the service is always friendly and fast!", "I wasn't expecting much, but this place blew us away. It's one of the best Indian restaurants in Tampa Bay. The ambience with white table linens is wonderful, but the food is the standout. The chicken 65 was incredible, and the hot sour soup was rich and flavorful. Our waitress, Angel, was friendly and attentive. Despite opening just a week ago, this spot is sure to become a foodie favorite for authentic Indian cuisine.", "It took me three visits to New Orleans before I finally managed to get in. The first two times, I attempted to wait in line, but this time we smartened up and purchased reserved seats to secure spots on the benches. Spending an extra $20 was totally worth it to avoid standing in line for an hour. Plus, the funds support the preservation of Jazz, so it's for a good cause\u2014definitely worth the splurge. The performance was phenomenal, showcasing true musicians with fantastic personalities. I can only imagine that this resembles concerts from 50 years ago. The band members were stylish, engaging, and incredibly talented. The venue is a small, intimate space that accommodates about 200 people, allowing you to see the joy on the musicians' faces as they share their art. This experience is a must when visiting New Orleans!", "Awesome experience! I was a first-time customer and didn't have an appointment because my other plans got rained out, and my dealership was too busy. I needed a PA State & Emissions inspection, which I usually dread since some places can totally rip you off. I really wanted to just get it done. I noticed this place had way better reviews on Yelp compared to other shops nearby.\n\nKeystone Discount Tire took my 2008 Pontiac Torrent in for inspection while I waited and sipped on some free coffee. I only had to get up once to check out some irregular outer front tire wear on my car when it was on the rack. I love it when the technician lets me see the issue for myself. It was nothing major, just needed an alignment later on. Bill was super friendly, knowledgeable, and gave me a straightforward rundown of my car's condition.\n\nMy car was fully inspected and stickered in less than an hour, and they didn\u2019t jack up my bill with extra charges. I definitely recommend getting on their mailing list for some great coupons!", "Wow! I can hardly believe it\u2014my son's phone is back in perfect shape after he dropped it! In less than half an hour, the experts worked their magic. The service was incredibly professional and outstanding! I'm absolutely thrilled!", "The service and management at the restaurant were abysmal. After completely bungling all four of our orders, the waiter became irate and started using profanities. In an attempt to make amends, the manager offered to waive the charges for our drinks. What a fiasco. The food was not only cold but also unappetizing, so much so that we couldn\u2019t even finish half of it, despite having waited over an hour. Following this dreadful experience, I have decided never to dine at any Cracker Barrel location again.", "I've stayed at several dog-friendly hotels, but never in the city, so I wasn't sure what to expect. Typically, they're more like motels. This one, however, was right in the city center. I walked cautiously into the hotel lobby with my Labrador/Golden Retriever mix, who is quite noticeable. As we reached the front desk to check in, I still felt uneasy despite my boyfriend's assurance that this was a dog-friendly hotel. The reception staff were so friendly, immediately putting us at ease. While we checked in, an attendant asked if Bentley could have some treats, which she thoroughly enjoyed. The receptionist also inquired if we would like a welcome kit for Bentley. Amazing! It included dog dishes, a mat, treats, and more. I was blown away. Additionally, other guests complimented and petted \"Queen Bentley.\" Our room was on the top floor, which was fantastic. Even when I took her for a walk, the car attendants greeted her by name. We were so impressed with the service that we decided to extend our stay by an extra night. Thank you, Loews. I had no idea a hotel could be so accommodating to a large dog.", "Sometimes the food here is exceptional, but it's inconsistent. I've been ordering the same dish for years, and half the time, it's amazing. It feels like different chefs are in the kitchen, so you never know what you're going to get. It's a 50/50 chance of being excellent. Ugh.", "I've been to this place twice and won\u2019t be going back. The first visit was just okay, but the second time was super disappointing. I ordered some ribs and had to send them back because one half was warm and the other half was fridge cold. They came back really hot on one side and still cold on the other. The third time they were finally edible. The manager came over the third time to apologize but didn\u2019t offer to comp anything. I\u2019m not one to make a fuss just to get free stuff, but having to send something back three times and only getting a half-hearted apology really annoyed me. Hence, this review!", "After trying several ramen places with lots of options and excellent broth, I was disappointed with the ramen at Cheu. Personally, I didn't like their thick noodles and very salty broth. However, the service was great, and they had a good selection of beers. My friend, who has been many times, loved it. I wish I liked it more, but I encourage others to try it for themselves. Maybe it's just not for me.", "Federal Doughnuts is the exciting new addition to the ballpark\u2014a dream come true for fans craving delectable doughnuts and crispy fried chicken! And that's not all; near section 136, there's a brand-new, dedicated gluten-free concession stand. Treat yourself to their mouthwatering pizza, savory cheesesteaks, and indulge in their delightful brownies and cookies.", "It appears there is now a second Red Kings restaurant in Chinatown, and it certainly lived up to expectations! This new location just opened yesterday, so it's unclear if it will replace the original Red Kings down the street or if it simply adds to the abundance of spicy Szechuan cuisine in the area. We opted for takeout and chose the Dan Dan Noodles and a shredded pork in garlic sauce dish. Both dishes had the perfect spice level\u2014intensely spicy, yet bursting with sweet, earthy, and fresh flavors. The portions were quite generous, ensuring we have plenty of leftovers. I'm eagerly anticipating trying more dishes and looking forward to dining in for a sit-down dinner. Additionally, they offer karaoke rooms upstairs and have a BYOB policy.", "This is one of the busiest Chick-fil-A locations I've seen, yet they always provide quick and exceptional service. I don't know how they do it, but they're consistently great! It's one of my favorite places!", "Great spot for salads! I visit every time I'm in town for lunch. It's quick, and the veggies are always fresh.", "On September 26th, 2015, my parents and I went on a tour of Oak Alley and Laura Plantations. Although I can't recall our driver's name, he provided us with a wealth of information during our journey to the plantations. The schedule was perfectly arranged, allowing us plenty of free time before and after the tours to explore the grounds. The return trip was also quite flexible with drop-off points. We chose to get off near Jackson Square, which gave us the opportunity to spend the rest of the afternoon enjoying the French Quarter.", "We've visited this place twice for brunch and had quite a pleasant experience both times. The food we've sampled has been delightful, especially the grits with scallions and sour cream. However, the room tends to be uncomfortably cold, so don't forget to bring a sweater!", "I absolutely love this place! They have the best hot dogs and chili dogs around. I make a point to go as often as I can. Yum!", "Waterline is an exceptional venue. I visited with friends for live music on Saturday and was thoroughly impressed. The ambiance is remarkable. The establishment offers the best local beer in the region, surpassing the offerings from Fig Mountain. I certainly prefer Waterline over Topa. Additionally, you can conveniently order outstanding cuisine from the Nook Restaurant and easily step into Lama Dog, which is a part of the Waterline complex. It was an outstanding experience.", "Excellent customer service! Even though we were slightly outside their pick-up range, they were very flexible and came to collect our group of 7. Upon arrival, we discovered we were charged for 8 instead of 7. A quick phone call later, and the extra ticket refund was processed in minutes! The tour itself was incredibly enjoyable! We spent the entire time laughing and smiling, and our tour guide was hilarious! We spotted numerous alligators, ranging from baby alligators swimming in the water to fully grown ones! We also saw turtles and birds! Our tour guide had a young alligator we could hold that he was caring for until it grew larger, as it was a late hatchling that wouldn't have survived otherwise. The return trip was also exciting as we sped along and the guide performed some \"tricks\" with the boat! I highly recommend this tour!!!", "Westfall transformed our roof this April, and the entire experience was outstanding. From top-notch quality and clear communication to diligent follow-up, we couldn\u2019t be happier. We\u2019re thrilled we chose this company for our roof replacement.", "Delicious food at fair prices and friendly staff. While it's not the best spot for dining in, it fits well with their fast-food take on vegan cuisine. Although the Buffalo Bella gets a lot of attention, I highly recommend the Cheesesteak. Also, don't miss out on the sweet potato fries\u2014absolute must-try!", "The ramen is pretty good! Nothing mind-blowing, but definitely enjoyable. The service is decent too. It's a solid spot for a quick bite, though I might explore other options if they\u2019re available. I\u2019ve been here twice and plan to keep coming back!", "A menu that satisfies everyone's cravings\u2014clean, trendy, and delicious! I recommend going early, before 9 am, because the wait gets longer after that. But honestly, it's so worth it. You'll leave feeling incredibly satisfied!", "I had the brisket sandwich with two sides and a drink for $9.99. It's great barbecue at an affordable price. The sides, such as potato casserole, creamed spinach, baked beans, and green beans, were wonderful.", "The food and service were absolutely incredible! My only wish is for more vegetarian and vegan options. I can't wait to return!", "The food is fantastic, but the customer service leaves much to be desired. I have visited three times and encountered two different older waitresses who were very unpleasant. However, the owner is delightful.", "A Franklin local I met on the flight mentioned this spot, urging us to endure the queue for one of Nashville's premier breakfast venues. HE WAS ABSOLUTELY SPOT ON. We were blown away by how fantastic it was, and luck favored us with no wait! According to our waitress, we managed to avoid the busy period. I savored a wonderfully flavorful corn pancake topped with bacon, salsa, and sour cream. Absolutely delicious. Every time I return to the South, this place is a must-visit~~~", "OMG!!! I can't believe this service exists! My husband scheduled a full detailing with Michael for next Saturday and confirmed on Friday, but Michael didn't know we wanted full detailing. He advised us to come the following Saturday instead. We arrived at 8am the next week, but the workshop was closed. Michael said he was busy and would call back, but didn't. We waited, went for breakfast, and returned at 9:30am. Alex, his partner, opened the shop at 9:30am, but still no Michael. Alex couldn't reach him. We gave up! Horrendous experience!", "During my move, I encountered several challenges and needed extra services from this office. The team here is exceptional and highly trustworthy. While I could elaborate on how well they took care of me, I'm concerned they might have gone beyond their usual duties. I would confidently recommend this office to my own mother!", "Last year, we stayed at The Saint for a girl's trip. The lobby is lovely with a cool bar and restaurant that impressed us immediately. The ambiance was just right\u2014charming and welcoming. I checked in a few hours before my friend and spent the time working in my room. Later, I stepped out for errands and returned when she arrived.\n\nOur excitement quickly fizzled when we spotted a huge flying roach in our room. Disturbed, I went straight to the front desk. They offered to send maintenance, but that wasn\u2019t adequate for me. They moved us to another room, but it too had issues: small spiders, dead bugs, a malfunctioning TV, and a lamp without bulbs. By 3 AM, I had decided we couldn\u2019t stay. I booked us into The W for the rest of the trip.\n\nAt 8 AM, there was still no manager, so I demanded a refund in person. A young gentleman apologized and promptly refunded our money, asking me to consider returning after improvements. Despite his politeness, I declined.", "Let's say you need a new door, but you only have $35. Where do you go? The Green Project. Or, if you have leftover building supplies like bits of lumber, roofing materials, or paint, where can you take them so they don't end up in a landfill? The Green Project.", "This is the worst place I've ever visited. The bouncer was unnecessarily rude. They seem to think that just because they're on Broadway, they can mistreat customers and overcharge. As a local, I will never visit or recommend this place.", "Dropped in for lunch with my girlfriend. The place was spotless, the food was amazing, and the prices were great! Can't wait to return!", "It is truly disheartening to witness the decline in quality at this establishment, where I have been a patron for years. The deterioration in the standard of food is quite evident. \n\nFirst, we shared an artichoke to start, which was evidently prepared in advance. It was cold on the inside despite the flesh being fully cooked. \n\nSecondly, my wife ordered a Greek salad that appeared to consist entirely of pre-packaged ingredients and was excessively dressed with a bland dressing. \n\nLastly, I had the grilled yellowtail, which was unfortunately overcooked and of poor quality\u2014seemingly an inferior, frozen piece of fish. This is simply unacceptable for Santa Barbara and I could not even finish it.\n\nIn summary, despite the excellent setting and good service, the subpar food makes a visit here hardly worth it. The establishment must significantly improve the quality of its food, or it risks becoming just another lower State Street dive for tourists.", "Milktooth is the ultimate spot for a delicious breakfast cocktail and a unique take on brunch. The menu might surprise you with its creative dishes, but I promise, whatever you choose will be fantastic. As one of the most popular brunch places in Indy, expect a typical 30-minute wait on weekends\u2014it's totally worth it.\n\nTo make the wait pleasant, grab a coffee and pastry from their walk-up bar for a little preview of what's to come. Their menu changes occasionally, but certain favorites stick around with fresh twists. I can't get enough of their Dutch pancakes and their amazing raclette grilled cheese.\n\nIf you're in the mood for a boozy breakfast, don't miss out on the michelada. And if the weather's nice, definitely opt for outdoor seating!", "The bar and staff were AMAZING. We received a room upgrade since we were on our honeymoon, and the view was gorgeous. However, the room itself was comparable to a Hilton, with rust on the tub floor and some strange stains on the tiles. These issues were only in the bathroom, so I still give it 4 stars. The staff were great, though the valet service was overpriced, so we parked a few streets away. That's the only downside I'd mention. I would recommend this place if you want to stay right in the busy downtown area of St. Louis. There are lots of cool bars and restaurants to enjoy on a Friday night.", "I loved the beginner class; it was perfectly paced and stretched me in new ways. The studio is clean, and I like that Beyond Organic food items are available.", "It's surprising that we only just discovered this place. Initially, we planned to dine at a chain lobster restaurant but sought a more genuine experience. A friend suggested Lobster Haven, and after checking it out online, it seemed reminiscent of places we visit in Massachusetts. We were thoroughly pleased! The service was excellent\u2014quick and very friendly. There is a vast selection of all the beloved seafood dishes. If you're looking for authentic New England seafood, you must visit this place. Additionally, you can buy live lobsters and fresh seafood to take home and cook yourself.", "Absolutely! \"Fabulous! Experience the best happy hour and indulge in a fresh menu with delish drinks. If I had the time, I'd be here every day!\"", "Men's Clubs is fantastic, no doubt about it. All the barbers are talented enough to give you a great haircut. I've been a regular for 3 years and have never had any issues \u2014 well, except once when someone tried to copy my hairstyle. But Tim was honest and said, \"I can't give you the same cut as Ryan.\" Thanks, Tim.", "My husband and I visit frequently. We adore the food as it's consistently fresh, and the service is excellent. We highly recommend this spot for sushi and hibachi enthusiasts.", "Chickie's and Pete's is the ultimate spot to catch a game and indulge in some delicious eats. While it might not be the finest dining experience, if you manage to snag a seat and enjoy a beer with some mussels red and crab fries, you're guaranteed to have a great time, whether it's game day or any day near the stadiums. My top picks include the crab fries, mussels red (I find the white version too garlicky sometimes), spicy pull and peel shrimp, steamers, and occasionally the blue crabs if I'm up for the effort\u2014they're worth it. This place makes it easy to dig into your food with plenty of sinks around to wash up afterward\u2014nice touch. In summary, Chickie's and Pete's is a Philly classic and always a blast. I highly recommend experiencing it at least once. Just keep in mind two things during major sporting events: 1. Finding a table can be nearly impossible and 2. You'll encounter lots of inebriated fans. I've been one myself, and we can be a bit much unless you're in the right mindset. :)", "Quick and professional service, even on a Saturday. Fixed my mirror easily. I've used them before in Charlotte, and they were great then as well.", "Great pick with Union Station in St. Louis! I dove into the Ponchartrain (which our server mentioned is just another name for Tilapia\u2014though it's also listed separately on the menu, which is a bit confusing!). The Ponchartrain, paired with mushrooms and a rich cream sauce, was delightful. We also sampled the shrimp cocktail and lump crab cake appetizers; they were decent, but nothing to write home about. The drinks were on point, and the service was up to par. We opted for the patio seating to enjoy the pleasant weather, but the indoor ambiance looked cozy and a touch more formal.", "Yesterday, I decided to drop by for a drink and was thoroughly impressed by the atmosphere\u2014it\u2019s an easy A+ in my book. This spot brings a refreshingly unique vibe to the St. Pete area. The meticulous remodeling work done here is phenomenal; it feels like stepping into a scene straight out of a Harry Potter movie. The background music is at just the right volume, allowing for clear conversation without having to shout, perfectly complementing the old library-like setting. Michael and Peggy were bartending and they were incredibly friendly and engaging, making for great conversation. Since I had already eaten, I didn't try the food, but the menu looks promising with notably reasonable prices for meat and cheese trays compared to other local options. I\u2019m definitely planning a return visit to sample the food and would highly recommend this place to anyone.", "Absolutely! I love Maple Street Patisserie; it's fantastic! I've always been thrilled with everything here. They make the best blueberry muffin I've ever tasted. It's a wonderful spot for both breakfast and lunch. They also offer specialty cakes, so be sure to visit during Mardi Gras to pick up a king cake. The owner, Ziggy, is incredible. He's always hustling and working long hours to create these delicious treats. This place is unbeatable!", "Great burger! I had the Bourbon Black and Bleu, and it was cooked perfectly and tasted awesome. I only gave 3 stars because of the wait. We had a big group\u20144 adults and 5 kids\u2014and it took over an hour to get our food. It really shouldn\u2019t have taken that long, no matter how many of us there were.", "Every time we have out-of-town guests, we love taking them to Katie's. The food selection is incredible and always beautifully prepared\u2014nothing else compares. The prices are reasonable, and the food is delicious; Katie's never lets us down. Whether you're in the mood for grilled oysters, shrimp and grits, a Cuban sandwich, pizza, or soup and salad, you're guaranteed a great meal. They also offer daily specials featuring local, seasonal ingredients to keep things exciting. The staff is warm and friendly, making the experience even better. If you plan on going on a Sunday, try to get there before church lets out to avoid a wait. But even if you do have to wait, you can enjoy bottomless Mimosas while you do!", "After attending the Zurich Classic golf tournament, I was craving something refreshing because it was warm and a bit humid. What could be tastier than an ice cream cone? Luckily, I found a parking space on the street. The interior of the place was cute and comfortable. They had a huge selection of flavors, and after sampling a couple of unusual ones, I chose a scoop of Cookie Monster ice cream on a cone. The ice cream was perfect\u2014not overly sweet. Creole Creamery is definitely worth checking out!", "I LOVE this place! I've been coming here for years. It's quirky, and while I wouldn't risk the escargot, the Saki, great rolls, and heaps of rice and Sashimi are top-notch. The young atmosphere, loud dance music, and plenty of Saki make it a must-visit!", "We have enjoyed everything we've tried here, with the Backyard Bowl being our favorite so far, though there are many more we still want to sample. My husband and I find that a kids size each or sharing a large portion fills us up completely. The ingredients are of high quality and quite filling, and the price is very reasonable considering this. Although it can get quite busy, it's worth the wait.", "The service was alright, though a bit unconventional since the staff member was new. The food presentation was appealing, but they should consider adding rice or more potato salad to the gumbo. The Sprite was flat, but I didn't really need it.", "This pancake place is awesome! The pancakes are so deliciously sweet and satisfying, perfect for anyone with a sweet tooth. The fact that they serve breakfast all day is an absolute win! The prices are just right, making it a great spot to enjoy a fantastic meal without breaking the bank. Sure, it gets a bit hectic during busy times, but that\u2019s just part of the lively atmosphere. It may not be the only place to get breakfast, but it\u2019s definitely worth checking out!", "Fantastic discoveries and an amazing team! We absolutely love our purchases and will definitely return!!!", "We've been coming here since I was a kid, and it's amazing how the staff has watched me grow up and now gets to see my kids grow up too! Everyone here is so personable and nice. The service is always prompt, and Yoli and Frank are the absolute best! The food is amazing, and I can't get enough of their shredded beef burro and cheese crisp. They really deliver authentic Mexican flavors!", "Dine-in experience receives 2 stars. Service was disappointing and the venue didn't meet expectations. The food was acceptable, so for takeout, this place might earn 3 stars. I ordered the lamb kebab, which tasted alright but was very plain\u2014just meat with no sauces, lettuce, or any accompaniments.", "This is the best Middle Eastern restaurant around! The food is always great and makes my tummy happy!", "I can't believe anyone would give this place just one star. Here's the truth: they have the BEST cannoli in the city. Termini's doesn't even come close, and Isgro's is overly hyped and underwhelming. Potito's is my go-to for cannoli\u2014I wouldn't even think of going anywhere else. I'm there every Christmas Eve and will be for the rest of my life. This year, I stood in line at Isgro's for TWO HOURS for a tiramisu, but I walked right into Potito's and got my bambino cannoli-stuffed cannoli. It's as amazing as it sounds\u2014trust me.", "I can't praise this tiny, authentic, and perfectly delicious eatery enough! Having grown up in the Texas panhandle with plenty of authentic Mexican food, I'm always on the lookout for good Mexican restaurants. El Limon is the best I've found in Pennsylvania! Their sopes, tostadas, enchiladas, fajitas, burritos, and fish tacos are all excellent and very reasonably priced. The waitstaff is consistently pleasant and attentive. The standout features: homemade tamales and free margaritas! Bring the whole family for an amazing Mexican feast! Ol\u00e9!", "I'm giving this joint 4 stars, but trust me\u2014they're on the cusp of being a full-fledged 5-star sensation! They've just opened, so a few hiccups are to be expected, and they are more than willing to make corrections and accommodations when needed. But let's talk about the food\u2014it's REALLY good!\n\nUnlike some other reviewers, I don't think their pizza is their strong suit. It's a bit greasy and the cheese doesn't taste like it's 100% mozzarella. But don't let that deter you because here's what I've tried, and it's amazing:\n\n- The Quaker (Chicken version): Absolutely delicious! They use chunky chicken steaks instead of shredded, which I prefer. The chicken could use a tad more seasoning, but the cheese was perfectly melted, and the veggies were incredibly fresh.\n\n- The fries: Crisp and full of flavor! I didn't even need ketchup, and that's saying something.\n\n- The onion rings: A bit greasy but still very tasty and crispy. The onions stayed in the breading, which I love.\n\n- Spanakopita: Mine was a little overcooked, but the flavors were spot on.\n\n- Baklava: VERY GOOD!\n\n- Signature Salad: Super fresh veggies and an excellent balsamic dressing. A total win!\n\n- The (turkey) Greek Burger: One of the best turkey burgers I've ever had! The patty was moist and flavorful, and topped with what must be homemade tzatziki. I could eat a bowl of that stuff! They used romaine instead of arugula, but it was so fresh that I didn't mind. I also asked for feta and didn't get it, but the sauce made me forget all about it.\n\nOverall, this place is fantastic! If they maintain their high-quality standards, I'll keep coming back for more!", "Planet Fitness earns a gleaming four stars primarily for its unbeatable 24-hour access. If affordability is your priority, you'll find it offers the best value for your money. While you may not spot many bodybuilders there, the crowd generally consists of larger individuals\u2014something I can relate to from my past. The gym features a tanning bed, massage chairs, and a sculpt machine, all for just $20.00 a month. Opt for the $9.99 plan if you're fine without the extras and don't mind flying solo. The staff? Unfailingly polite and helpful, making each visit pleasant.", "I was very disappointed. We went to eat at 2:15 on Saturday, only to be told the kitchen had closed at 2. Their website indicates they serve all day on Saturdays and Sundays, and it also states they are open until 5. When a place cannot manage simple details like updating their hours on the website, it makes me question their attention to quality and other \"small\" things.", "They deliver quality work promptly and offer a warranty. I highly recommend them!", "I dine here at least twice a week. The servers are consistently friendly, and the food is incredible. I always leave satisfied and with a full stomach.", "What a delightful discovery! This establishment is the transformed Carrow's Restaurant on Plumb and Kietzke, saved from demolition by its stunning redwood beams and fascia. The food was fantastic. My wife enjoyed the tri-tip salad, featuring greens on one side with a balsamic vinaigrette, balanced by four generous slices of medium-rare tri-tip and crunchy potato \"croutons\" \u2013 little heavenly bits of crispy potatoes. I opted for the tri-tip and chicken combo, accompanied by a fresh corn salad and potato salad. It was so delectable that we decided to order dessert, which is a rare treat for me. The dessert options included lemon meringue, mud pie, apple pie, and ice cream. We shared the lemon meringue, and it was superb, with real meringue perfectly set and browned. The prices were very reasonable given the quality of the food and the overall experience. We've already recommended this gem to our local family and friends and look forward to returning soon. Well done!", "Rebecca didn't help with my birth as a Doula, but she was our nanny for our first daughter. Over the months she spent in our home, I found myself looking forward to chatting with her before and after work. I was heavily pregnant with Baby #2, and her advice was very helpful to me as an expecting mom. She was always approachable, honest, and truthful, which I really appreciated. She loves being a Doula and finds beauty and strength in that special role. Rebecca would be a great addition to your support team!", "I recently had my car tinted at Orange Tint and Tune and received excellent service. They offer a convenient car pick-up service if you live within 4 miles of their shop. Carlos, the technician, explained all the tint options and adjusted the tint to match the look I wanted. This level of customer care deserves 5 stars. The receptionist was very friendly, and the owner, Dustin, even followed up to check on my experience.", "I stayed here for three nights on a business trip. The property is very close to the airport, but you can't really hear any noise from it. The rooms are the typical TownePlace Suites setup, complete with a refrigerator, stove, and other amenities. The hotel is in a quiet area, surrounded by other hotels and office buildings. It's about a 20-minute drive to downtown or the university, and just 5-10 minutes from the Pima Air Museum. There aren\u2019t many restaurants nearby, but there are a few fast food restaurants and a great sandwich place called Baggins within walking distance. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. They offer a standard continental breakfast with a couple of hot options and have a reception on weekday evenings. My only complaint is that the food and drinks at the reception run out quickly, so it's best to go early. I arrived 45 minutes after it started and found there was still food left but very few soft drinks, and no diet options. It would be better if they restocked the area throughout the event. Overall, the rooms are nice, the beds are comfortable, and the area feels safe.", "Our journey took an unexpected turn to Tampa, so we opted to drive to Orlando. First, though, we needed a place to eat. Eager to avoid chain restaurants, Yelp led us to this charming local spot! The ladies ordered the 7 oz. Tampa strip, while the gents went for the 14 oz. ribeye. They grill their steaks over oak and citrus wood, giving them an incredible smoky flavor that's simply irresistible! As enthusiasts of wood-smoked steaks ourselves, we were thrilled to find a restaurant that shares our love for this cooking method. The sides consisted of vegetables and sweet potatoes. \n\nThe wine selection was impressively priced, with most bottles under $20\u2014what a refreshing change from the usual high markups! Our waitress, Lisa, offered fantastic recommendations and provided excellent, friendly service. We're so happy we chose a local restaurant over a chain. We will certainly mark this spot for a return visit next time we're in Tampa!", "After my previous review, the owner of this location (and two others, including Southampton) reached out to me. We talked for half an hour, and I was very impressed with his business approach. He's definitely someone I want to do business with. I returned to Saladworks twice, and the service had vastly improved. The new summer salads are wonderful!", "The best deli I've visited in the US! So many choices make it hard to pick. The Muffalata feeds four and is delicious. Visit on Saturday or Thursday night for live music. The special is a great choice, with plenty of sides like chili, potato salad, and chips. Go now!", "My dad and I are on a cross-country trip, and one of our first stops was Saguaro National Park. We took a quick tour with Park Ranger Carolyn and loved it. She was incredibly enthusiastic, passionate about her studies on the saguaro, and very knowledgeable. We definitely recommend both the tour and Carolyn.", "I came here after my husband brought home their amazing lemon pepper wings. They have so many flavors to choose from! You'll find classics like lemon pepper and mild, as well as unique New Orleans flavors like yaka mein and noonie bird. Their drinks are also fantastic \u2013 the watermelon drink is absolutely to die for. I'm not sure what their secret ingredient is, but it's incredible! The location isn't the greatest, but they're making an effort to give back to the community. It's close to the daiquiri shop, so it's quite safe during the day. I might avoid coming alone at night, though. Definitely give this place a try. Who knows, you might even bump into Skip!", "Returning to Tom Jones, it's time to refresh my review. I noticed that the peculiar ATM-like machine which only allowed you to withdraw money for your check is no longer present. It used to be located near the restrooms. However, there's still a payphone back there which I really appreciate. Now, there are ATMs near the front entrance.\n\nThe blue ribbon special is now priced at $3.79, but it's still a great deal because it includes everything: pancakes, two eggs, toast, sausage, bacon, juice, and coffee. I dined here with my kids, as it was my daughter\u2019s pick. She says she \"loves Tom Jones.\" Our meal selections included blue ribbons, French toast, chicken, a club sandwich, and a baked potato. Everyone was able to get what they liked.\n\nI didn\u2019t notice any stale smoke odor and wouldn\u2019t describe the place as dirty. I like the \"loud\" orange booths; they give a nostalgic feel along with the payphone. The service is consistently fast, and I always seem to have a different waitress. Not sure where they find these young ladies, but they all do a great job. I\u2019ve seen different managers there, and they are all efficient and proactive\u2013traits of good managers.\n\nSince it's my daughter\u2019s favorite place, I\u2019m increasing my rating from 4 to 5 stars.", "As an amateur athlete, I first met Dr. Ferrel while playing softball. He treated my severe injury on the field and asked me to visit his office for further treatment. Initially, I declined due to financial constraints as a single mom on a teacher's salary. Another physician estimated months for recovery, but feeling hopeless, I reached out to Dr. Ferrel again. He treated and healed me within weeks. Over the years, Dr. Ferrel has consistently achieved amazing results. He will always be my hero.", "Their shows are always a blast! You'll find an entertaining and relaxed atmosphere that's perfect for a great night out. Delicious food, good times, and fair prices make this the go-to spot for an unforgettable experience.", "I love In-N-Out. Sometimes, you just crave it. Four patties, animal style!", "Cindy's is truly exceptional! The food and service are outstanding, offering an authentic culinary experience that stands out. Every dish is freshly prepared, and you can immediately taste the difference compared to other Mexican restaurants. I highly recommend Cindy's to anyone who loves Mexican cuisine.", "I've been wanting to try Trust Me BBQ for over a year now. I stopped by about three months ago but left after waiting ten minutes without any service. After reading some reviews, I decided to give it another shot just to see what the buzz was about. Honestly, the food was hit or miss, but the service was terrible, so I doubt I'll go back. The guy behind the counter didn't speak, smile, or engage with us at all\u2014it felt like dealing with a vending machine. When we finally ordered, he didn't pay attention and gave us the wrong sides. We had to correct him as he was serving. \n\nIn the end, I'll stick with Down to the Bone BBQ. \n\nPros: The BBQ sauce is delicious, the macaroni salad was unique and interesting, and the \"pulled\" pork was nice and moist.\nCons: The chicken was drier than a sheet of paper, completely inedible even with BBQ sauce. The mac & cheese seemed like it had been sitting on the steam table for days, and the collard greens were barely flavored.", "While I was in town for a week, I stumbled upon this little hole in the wall. The pa nang chicken was excellent; I ordered it with one-star spice level and it arrived quickly. I'll definitely be coming back.", "Cinco de Mayo just wouldn't be complete without margaritas, sangria, and all things fried! This fantastic spot masterfully blends flavors from diverse ethnicities to create truly unique recipes. While it may not be labeled as a traditional \"Mexican\" eatery, they excel at crafting the perfect tequila-infused drinks and rocking that rock salt. Plus, they've recently launched a wine bar just a few doors down, offering overflow seating and exclusive bottles. Their on-the-rocks margaritas and house-made white or red sangria are absolute must-tries\u2014definitely worth the visit!", "This charming donut bakery, nestled in one of Hermitage's oldest shopping centers, goes beyond expectations. Baking fresh donuts daily is no simple task; it requires starting in the early morning hours. Yeu, the dedicated owner, offers not only the classic donuts but also unique creations like bacon-topped donuts, apple fritters, pigs in a blanket, breakfast pastries, and kolaches. The standout treat? The doughssant\u2014a divine fusion of a donut and a croissant. These delights alone make the visit worthwhile. Prices are incredibly affordable: doughssants at $1.99 each and regular donuts at just $0.60 each. These delicious treats are a hit with my kid's school teachers. And don't forget, they serve coffee too!", "We've had a fantastic time at every event we've attended. We've enjoyed concerts, basketball games, and other activities that were a lot of fun. The food has been excellent, with many local favorites on offer.", "The food at this restaurant is excellent. We sampled three appetizers and five entr\u00e9es, and each was a delightful experience. The menu offers reasonable prices, and the service is attentive and efficient. I am eager to return multiple times.", "The quality of service at this establishment has declined. We were frequent patrons, but we have since chosen to visit another location. The service has become notably slow and sometimes neglectful.", "This was by far the worst chicken and rice plate I've ever had. Despite being assured there was no sauce on the chicken to keep it healthy, the dish was drenched in oil. By the time I reached my car, oil had spilled out of the container and soaked the bag. There must have been at least 5-7 tablespoons of oil on the plate. This is not what I was promised, and certainly not what anyone would want to eat. It's ironic that their slogan includes the word \"healthy.\" What a joke.", "I recently purchased a washer and dryer for my new home, and though I wasn't expecting much based on the poor reviews, I was pleasantly surprised. The selection was impressive, and the salespeople were clearly well-versed in their products, making the process easier than anticipated. The timely delivery also exceeded my low expectations. \n\nDespite being skeptical, I felt the staff genuinely tried to offer me the most competitive pricing and guided me through several budget-friendly options. They even checked for additional discounts, which was a nice touch. I appreciated the honest feedback and thorough answers to all my questions. My experience at Sears defied the negative reviews, and I ended up quite satisfied. Given my experience, I'd suggest giving them a chance.", "The food here is fantastic. Service is quick, and the staff is incredibly friendly. I always feel welcome when I place my orders.", "I finally got to try them out. Wow, they did an awesome job with the remodel. I loved the mushroom cheesesteak!", "The espresso here is exceptional, making it my favorite spot for an Americano. The staff is courteous and friendly, and the atmosphere is relaxed. While there are no power outlets available, there is unlimited WiFi access. The bathrooms and the rest of the establishment are consistently clean.", "Prompted by the high ratings and enthusiastic recommendations, I decided to give this establishment a try, only to find the overall experience disappointingly lackluster from beginning to end. The website is scarcely useful for menu reconnaissance, necessitating an inconvenient navigation through three location choices and then scrolling to find minimalistic descriptions devoid of explanations or prices. The menu items are listed as follows: Roast Beef, Roast Beef Combo, Roast Pork, Roast Pork Combo, Baked Ham, Baked Ham Combo, Roast Turkey, Roast Turkey Combo, Broccoli Rabe, and Broccoli Rabe Combo. There is no clarification on what constitutes a \"combo\" (which, as I later discovered, merely entails the addition of cheese).\n\nUpon my arrival, the venue seemed more akin to a bar than a restaurant, although there were designated tables. Faced with indecision and considering the sandwiches were reasonably priced at $6.85, I opted for both the Roast Beef and Roast Pork combos. The sandwiches were served promptly; however, the roast beef was noticeably cold while the roast pork was hot. It is perplexing how the kitchen could allow such a glaring temperature disparity in simultaneously prepared items, clearly indicating one had been left sitting for some time.\n\nI requested the waitress to reheat the roast beef while I consumed the roast pork. Allegedly reheated, the roast beef emerged marginally warmer yet still far from satisfactory compared to the freshly finished roast pork. Although the waitress kindly offered to replace the sandwich, time constraints deterred me from accepting a replacement.\n\nThe sandwiches proved underwhelming in substance, skimpy on meat, and overly drenched in gravy to the detriment of the bread's integrity, resulting in a messy affair. The table place card, which provided more comprehensive descriptions than the website, mentioned a \"wet meat\" option with less gravy. I strongly advise opting for this alternative to prevent the gravy from overpowering both the meat's flavor and the sandwich's structural stability.", "I got takeout from Village Whiskey, so I can't comment on the restaurant itself. The Whiskey Burger is expensive at $26 but fantastic if you don't mind a greasier burger. It's very tender, the bacon is excellent, and it's quite sizable. If the price isn't an issue for you, I highly recommend it. The Duck Fat fries are also very rich and tasty.", "I spent $80 on food for the family, and it was absolutely worth every penny. The dishes we received were not only hot and delicious, but the orange chicken, in particular, was the best I've tasted in quite some time. As a result, this restaurant is now going to be our go-to place for Asian cuisine!", "I usually do my laundry at my boyfriend's house, but after having family staying over recently, I faced a mountain of towels, sheets, and comforters to wash. I needed a laundromat that was safe, clean, and free from sketchy vibes. When I found this facility, I was over the moon! It's spotless, brightly lit, and the staff couldn't be more friendly and helpful. I was blown away by how fast the washers and dryers were. I knocked out four massive loads (the equivalent of eight regular ones) in just under two hours! This place has everything: security cameras, flat-screen TVs, magazines, Wi-Fi, clean bathrooms, and vending machines. The atmosphere is fantastic for doing laundry. It wasn't crowded at all, with plenty of washers and dryers available. I'm thrilled I discovered this gem. Thank you, LAUNDROMAT!!!", "We went in for a late-night dinner yesterday. The prices are definitely on the higher side. Both couples opted to share a plate (which visibly annoyed our server), and while the food was good, it didn't justify the cost. However, the garlic bread served before the meal was absolutely amazing! I could have easily eaten a lot of it. Overall, I probably wouldn't choose to dine there again. It might have just been an off night, but with so much competition in the St. Louis food scene, there are better options.", "Dropped by to grab a burger during today's Seahawks/Saints game, and the place was understandably packed. And for good reason: the Haven burger I had was excellent. I sat right by the door, so I didn't get more than six feet inside. As soon as I got my meal, the crowd kept growing until I had to navigate through a maze of people to leave. Clearly, I wasn't the first to discover this spot. I'll definitely be returning to the Haven. Maybe for lunch on a Tuesday when it's less busy.", "I am only able to provide feedback on the vermicelli bowls, as I have not yet had the opportunity to try the Pho. The vermicelli portions are generous and offer good value for the price. The restaurant is conveniently situated for those residing in the Alberta Avenue area. Impressively, my orders have consistently been prepared within 15 minutes, even during the busy period of a Friday evening.", "I tried the Chicken Marsala that our waiter suggested. The chicken was super thin, tough, and dry. The pasta was undercooked and all clumped together. It had zero flavor. My friend got the lasagna and didn't like it either. There was only a thin layer of pasta, and it was bland. Another friend of mine had her plate taken away while she was in the restroom even though she told the waiter she wasn't done. They did give her a new meal to take home, though. On the bright side, the atmosphere was great with live music, and I had fun dancing with my husband. But honestly, the food was terrible, and it was pretty pricey.", "This place is fantastic! It has a nice atmosphere, is conveniently located near the Broad Street line, and has plenty of street parking. It's also BYOB. I've visited twice and loved every dish. My favorites were the chaats, beef short ribs, lamb vindaloo, beet salad, breads and pickles, and chai. We always get the chocolate cake to share, and everyone enjoys it. You can also get takeout beer from the corner bar. We will definitely return.", "I absolutely love this restaurant! I consistently go for their mouthwatering ceviche. The vibe is lively, and the staff is outstanding. Alex served us and was incredibly friendly, attentive, and considerate.", "Absolutely love this place! It's hard to find someone who wouldn't. With a fresh salad bar and a wide variety of ethnic foods to explore, there's so much to enjoy. N-JOY", "I ordered a Mediterranean chicken shawarma. It had great flavor, and they were generous with the amount of chicken in the pita. The food was ready when I got there, and the service was good. I'll definitely go back next time I'm around.", "Love this place! Great food, pleasant space and staff. Highly recommended for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians.", "Service was slow at first, but I was happy once it started. The gumbo was awesome and I loved the chicken & waffles. Friendly staff and a great spot on Bourbon St for people watching!", "For an airport grab-and-go restaurant, Earl offers a respectable variety of sandwich options such as turkey, tuna, and even a Hawaiian. Today, however, the enticing aroma of roast beef caught my attention, prompting me to choose that one. I wasn't disappointed. The sandwich featured a generous portion of sliced beef, cooked beyond medium, topped with cheddar cheese and a delicious horseradish sauce. Trust me, you don't need lettuce or tomatoes; it's perfect as it is. Conveniently located between the security station and the top of the D gates, near the Delta SkyClub, Earl makes it easy to grab a bite to eat at the gate or onboard. Yum.", "WOW! What an incredible spot! Food: A+, Service: A+++ We began with an appetizer of cheese curds paired with red pepper jelly. LOVED IT! I had the fish tacos, and my wife had a beer brat for dinner. We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals! The portions were generous and reasonably priced. Our server was excellent\u2014very attentive, knowledgeable about the menu, and made us feel very welcome. The manager stopped by to check on us, and I mentioned that I might have found a new favorite place to hang out, have a beer, and watch football. He informed us about great game day deals and their weekend brunch. Everyone said goodbye as we left and reminded us to grab a root beer candy on our way out. I will definitely be back!", "I dropped by for dinner and a drink and left feeling completely satisfied! Normally, I avoid ordering burgers when dining out since they're so easy to make at home. However, this experience might just change that habit. The burger was so good that I'll struggle to order anything else next time. Plus, the beer selection didn't disappoint, and the friendly wait staff and bartenders made me feel right at home. My meal arrived just as I had asked and in no time at all. The restaurant's ambiance was pleasant, and the restrooms were spotless. Overall, it was a delightful visit!"]
