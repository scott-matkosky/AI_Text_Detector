["Should you choose to dine here, be prepared for a leisurely experience, as a visit typically requires a two-hour commitment.  While the establishment holds a certain allure, having frequented its sister locations in New Jersey with consistently positive results, the reality of this particular venue has proven consistently protracted. \n\nAlthough the cuisine itself is commendable, its arrival is often met with an unfortunate delay. The service, while generally amiable, is rendered by a notably youthful staff. Ultimately, the repeated encounters with extended waiting periods have led us to explore alternative dining options, particularly on weekends when time is often of the essence. \n", "As an avid indoor cycling enthusiast with years of experience at various studios, I can confidently say that Body Cycle stands in a league of its own.  The studio itself is impeccably maintained, featuring state-of-the-art stationary bikes equipped with advanced metrics tracking (like wattage output and RPM) allowing riders to monitor performance and progress. This commitment to quality is echoed in their choice of instructors -  each one is not only highly qualified and motivating but creates a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere for riders of all levels. \n\nOne of the standout features of Body Cycle is their seamless online scheduling system.  Unlike many fitness studios that require advance booking or have limited class times, Body Cycle's system provides ample flexibility, making it effortless to integrate workouts into a busy schedule.  \n\nFinally, it's impossible to overstate the positive impact of Russell, the owner of Body Cycle.  His passion for fitness and cycling is contagious, and his dedication to his clients' success is evident in every aspect of the studio. Russell's hands-on approach, from personally checking in on classes to actively seeking client feedback,  demonstrates a genuine commitment to fostering a supportive and results-driven environment. He truly leads by example, pushing riders to their limits while maintaining an encouraging and positive demeanor. \n", "This unassuming family-style diner offers a surprisingly diverse buffet. My plate was a testament to that, featuring a mix of unexpected flavors - a juicy roasted chicken leg, a crispy fried jalape\u00f1o, a savory tamale, delicate grape leaves, and a refreshing slice of melon.  While the buffet boasted an array of Mexican-inspired dishes, the menu also tempts with all-day breakfast options.  The service is warm and attentive, creating a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere perfect for a low-key meal.  Its convenient location adjacent to the Clarion Hotel makes it an easy choice for travelers. \n", "This place is absolutely charming!  The interior is adorable, and the owner (I believe?) was kind enough to give us a sneak peek of their upcoming patio and rooftop area \u2013 it's going to be amazing, especially on gorgeous days like today. \n\nWe started with the cheese curds, which were both delicious and surprisingly filling. I really appreciate that the sandwiches come with a side salad, which provided a nice balance after indulging in those cheesy curds!  I opted for the onion, gruyere, and tomato sandwich.  I enjoyed that it wasn\u2019t overloaded with cheese, but I did feel like it needed a touch more flavor \u2013 perhaps some pepper jelly? It would be fantastic to see more menu options in the future, like salads featuring interesting cheeses.\n\nThey have a great selection of beer and wine, along with a few cocktails. Next time, I'm definitely trying one of the draft wines \u2013 they sounded intriguing! \n", "I\u2019m incredibly disappointed in this restaurant. As a loyal customer for years, I was shocked by their recent refusal to accommodate a simple takeout order.  I requested three appetizers, and despite the restaurant being far from full, they told me they were too busy. \n\nTheir lack of customer service is astounding, especially considering my history as a regular and generous tipper. Thankfully, a new restaurant, Kanella, just opened nearby.  I'll gladly take my business there from now on. I won't be returning to Dmitri's. \n", "This tour provided a comprehensive and engaging introduction to New Orleans, making it an excellent choice for first-time visitors.  The tour offered a balanced approach, dedicating the first hour to exploring the historic French Quarter before venturing into the renowned cemetery for the second half. \n\nThe tour guide was knowledgeable and provided insightful commentary throughout.  The meeting point, located in front of a grocery store, might seem unusual initially but proves easy to find. A conveniently timed restroom break at a visitor center ensures participant comfort.  Overall, this tour was well-structured and informative, offering valuable insights into the city's rich history and cultural significance. \n", "This hidden gem serves up amazingly delicious wings with homemade bleu cheese that will knock your socks off.  The ribeye steak was equally impressive \u2013 tender, cooked to perfection, and bursting with flavor.  Complement your meal with their nice selection of craft beers.  Don't miss out on this local favorite! \n", "While Los Padres National Forest is undeniably scenic, its natural beauty is unfortunately marred by a lack of upkeep, particularly in the White Rock area.  The accumulation of dead grass encroaching upon the rock formations and waterways significantly detracts from the area's aesthetic appeal.  \n\nIt is our hope that the Los Padres National Forest staff will prioritize the removal of this overgrowth, restoring the area's natural splendor.   Furthermore, addressing the water quality, which currently presents as stagnant and discolored, would greatly enhance the visitor experience.  \n\nA comparison to Cachuma Lake highlights the disparity in maintenance efforts.  Increased diligence in the preservation and upkeep of Los Padres National Forest is essential to ensure its continued enjoyment by the public. \n", "We had a hibachi dinner for six here, and while the food was pretty good, the service had a few hiccups. Our waitress accidentally brought all our sushi orders on one plate, making it tricky to sort out who ordered what. She also missed a couple of items on one of the orders. It wasn't a big deal, but since the restaurant was pretty quiet that night, it was a bit surprising.\n\nThe hibachi chef, Francisco, was really skilled and cooked everything perfectly. He was a little quiet, though, which was a change from the usual lively hibachi experience.\n\nOverall, I'm hoping it was just an off night for them. But, for the price, I'm not sure I'd rush back. \n", "Shalimar Jewelry provided efficient and professional service regarding a ring resizing.  The initial estimate for a same-day resizing was accurate and the work was completed promptly. While a subsequent adjustment was required due to a customer error in sizing, Shalimar accommodated this need graciously and without additional charge. Their understanding and customer-centric approach fostered a positive experience overall. \n", "Despite what the locals claim, Milktooth turned out to be a huge disappointment.  I regret wasting a meal at this supposed \"gem\" of Indianapolis. \n", "This restaurant is a fantastic spot for happy hour or dinner, boasting a comfortable patio with fans to combat the St. Louis heat. They're incredibly accommodating and willing to modify menu items to suit individual preferences, like swapping out pasta for mixed greens on the Veal Milanese.  Highly recommend!\n", "This place serves up seriously delicious Italian!  The gnocchi with marinara was divine, and the baked eggplant appetizer was a real standout. While the service was a tad slow, the incredible food more than makes up for it. Trust me, it's worth the wait!\n", "The Sonoran hot dog here is elevated to legendary status by its incredible bun. Imagine a warm, soft, and chewy embrace for the hot dog \u2013 a comforting hug that elevates every single bite. While it might seem like overkill at first, don't be fooled! This bun strikes the perfect balance, unlike imitations that fall flat.\n\nThe hot dog itself is tasty, but a touch more snap or sear on either the dog or bacon would provide a welcome contrast to the assertive mustard and onions. \n\nTheir carne asada caramelo is another winner - a perfect marriage of a quality tortilla, salty, melty cheese, and flavorful carne asada. \n\nDid I mention it's super affordable and you can conveniently drive through? \n", "If you're looking for a delicious breakfast spot, give this place a try! I highly recommend the waffle \u2013 it's perfectly fluffy and cooked to perfection. And don't miss out on the home fries, which are crispy, crunchy, and smashed just the way I like them.  The waitstaff is friendly and attentive, making for a truly enjoyable dining experience.  You can bet I'll be back for more! \n", "The food and service here are both excellent \u2013 our server, Douglas, deserves a special shout-out. While it's definitely a pricey place, with main courses averaging $40-50, the upscale atmosphere rivals any top-tier restaurant nationwide. \n", "My husband and I have made this restaurant a regular haunt, and each visit has been a culinary delight.  What truly sets it apart, however, is their exceptional attention to dietary needs. As someone with Celiac disease, navigating restaurant menus can be a minefield, but the staff here puts all my worries to rest. From the servers to the bartenders, their menu knowledge is impeccable. They effortlessly guide me through options, suggesting substitutions or modifications without batting an eyelid. \n\nAnd the food itself? Divine doesn't even begin to describe it. Every dish bursts with flavor, and the wine and cocktail menus are carefully curated to complement the culinary experience. \n\nMy only tiny wish? A dedicated gluten-free dessert would be the cherry on top!  While we usually have to satisfy our sweet tooth elsewhere, it's a minor inconvenience that doesn't diminish the overall brilliance of this gem.  We'll undoubtedly be back, again and again!\n\n\n", "This caf\u00e9 has stolen my heart!  It's officially my favorite spot in the city, and for good reason. Their black and white latte is pure perfection \u2013 not too sweet, with that dreamy foam art that makes every sip a delight. Even if you're not usually a soup person, trust me, theirs will convert you.  \n\nAnd can we talk about the ambiance? It's a freelancer's dream come true!  Plenty of space to spread out,  the perfect hum of conversation and music to keep you focused, and the occasional adorable dog sighting to brighten your day. This caf\u00e9 is a true gem, and I'll be a loyal customer for as long as they'll have me. \n", "Oh my goodness, this pumpkin pie frozen custard is incredible!  Imagine creamy frozen custard blended with chunks of real pumpkin pie and a delightful crunch of pie crust in every bite. It's like discovering a hidden treasure! This flavor deserves national recognition - it's seriously that good!  \n", "Looking for a relaxing yet entertaining way to spend your Friday night? Look no further!  This show was the perfect escape \u2013  engaging, enjoyable, and a perfect way to unwind after a long week.  Don't miss out! \n\n\n", "Craving sushi? This place hits the spot!  Their salmon is the star of the show \u2013  fresh, flavorful, and always a winner. And hey, even though it's the only sushi game in town, they don't disappoint!  We're hooked on their spicy edamame, crispy tempura, and refreshing ocean and cabbage salads.  Plus, the service is super friendly and lightning-fast.  Sushi fix?  Consider it handled!\n", "While I hold the 96th Street Naked Tchopstix location in high regard, my experience at this newer establishment was slightly less impressive. The focus here leans towards takeout, though a modestly sized dining area is available.  The ordering process, conducted at the counter with delivery to table, is efficient and utilizes a paper menu for customization. This method eliminates potential communication barriers and allows for a clear understanding of ingredient options. \n\nWhile the sushi bowl concept is appealing, the execution fell slightly short of expectations. The vegetable selection felt limited, and the rice-to-topping ratio skewed heavily towards rice. However, the sauces were flavorful. Similarly, the Maui roll, while satisfactory, did not reach the standard set by the 96th Street location in terms of quality and consistency. \n\nIt is important to note that comparisons to fast food establishments are unwarranted.  Sushi preparation inherently requires more time, and patience is key.  As a healthier alternative within the area, Naked Tchopstix offers a worthwhile dining experience. \n\nIn closing, I would like to commend the bubble tea offerings. The strawberry flavor was particularly enjoyable, and I anticipate sampling the vanilla chai on my next visit. \n", "We recently had the pleasure of dining at this establishment for a midday meal.  The beef brisket sandwich was particularly noteworthy, exhibiting a remarkable tenderness and succulence.  Similarly, the pulled pork was equally commendable in terms of flavor and preparation. \n\n\n", "I've been on a quest for the best Thai food in the area, and let me tell you, this place has stolen my heart (and my stomach)! Each bite was a symphony of flavors\u2014a vibrant journey to the heart of Thailand.  From the fragrant curries to the perfectly cooked noodles, every dish tasted truly authentic and utterly delicious. I can already tell this will be my new go-to spot\u2014prepare for many return visits!  \n", "The service at this restaurant was unacceptable, and the food quality was subpar. Choosing a different establishment for my final meal in town would have been a wiser decision. \n", "My wife and I had a fantastic dinner here recently. The food was excellent, arrived quickly, and tasted fresh and homemade.  Our only challenge was narrowing down the menu \u2013 so many tempting options!  We can't wait to go back and try more. \n", "This place is a gem!  The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, the service is friendly and fun, and the food is absolutely incredible - plus it comes out fast! Can't wait to go back. \n\n\n", "This place serves a fantastic burger!  Perfectly seasoned and cooked to juicy perfection.  Don't miss the fries and the salad \u2013 both excellent choices.  The restaurant itself has a charming, quaint atmosphere with outdoor seating only. The staff is super friendly, and parking is a breeze with both street and lot options.  Highly recommend! \n\n\n", "This store is fantastic! It's always clean, incredibly well-stocked, and the staff is incredibly helpful and friendly. They go above and beyond, even remembering my custom breakfast bagel order!  It's my go-to for everything I need. \n", "A few years back, I brought my vehicle to this shop for a manufacturer recall repair, which they handled successfully.  Recently, a new, unrelated noise began, and I suspected it stemmed from the previous issue. Kevin and his mechanic inspected my car immediately and resolved the problem free of charge, despite my willingness to pay. Their integrity and generosity were remarkable. I highly recommend them! \n", "Okay, I am officially *obsessed* with Sweet CeCe's!  I realized I've never even reviewed my local spot, which is a crime because their frozen yogurt is AMAZING.  Seriously, love love love!  They have a great topping selection too \u2013 a little something for everyone, from healthy fruit to total-indulgence toppings. \n\nOkay, sometimes the staff can be a little MIA or forget to mention deals (hello, $5 Friday!), but I can't even be mad. This place is my happy place, and the froyo is just that good! Four stars all the way! \n", "\"Oh my gosh, this place is such a great addition to the Funk Zone! You can grab a bite to eat, do some wine tastings... it's perfect.  And it's right next door to the Santa Barbara Wine Collective, they even share tables, I think.  We had the most amazing savory croissant there!\" \n", "This massage therapy center consistently delivers an exceptional experience.  Their online booking system is incredibly efficient, allowing for effortless same-day appointments.  The therapists employed at the center are all highly skilled and knowledgeable in various massage modalities, ensuring a personalized and therapeutic session tailored to individual needs.  Whether seeking relaxation or relief from muscle tension, clients are sure to leave feeling rejuvenated and revitalized.  \n\n\n", "The Peppermill, with its Vegas-style grandeur, offers a luxurious experience.  Complimentary valet parking adds a touch of convenience. The hotel boasts numerous dining options, a massive casino (though be wary of misleading penny slot denominations), and spacious rooms with impressive amenities. Our Tuscany Tower room featured a stunning pool view, free WiFi, a large bathroom with a luxurious shower, a jetted tub, and ample counter space.  The comfortable king bedroom provided all necessary comforts, including a mini-fridge, safe, and spacious work area.  Courteous staff and a comfortable temperature rounded out a very pleasant stay.\n\n\n", "This deli impressed with its expansive menu and efficient service.  I opted for the \"Turkey Avocado Bacon Panini,\" featuring oven-roasted turkey breast, fresh avocado slices, crispy bacon, and melted provolone cheese on toasted ciabatta bread. My companion chose the \"Buffalo Chicken Wrap,\" a flour tortilla filled with seasoned chicken breast tossed in a spicy buffalo sauce, shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, and a creamy bleu cheese dressing. \n\nBoth selections were generously portioned, emphasizing fresh ingredients and balanced flavor profiles.  The order fulfillment time was minimal, proving ideal for a quick and satisfying lunch break. The establishment also boasts an impressive array of additional offerings, including composed salads, homemade soups, classic macaroni salads, hot entrees, and a comprehensive selection of deli sandwiches.   Their diverse menu caters to a wide range of palates and dietary preferences.  \n\n\n", "This place has AH-MAZING biscuits! Like, seriously good.  And they have other yummy stuff too!  Grown-ups love their cocktails (whatever those are!).  It gets kinda crowded, but totally worth checking out! \n\n\n", "This restaurant offers a unique dining experience with its cozy, fishing lodge-inspired atmosphere.  The menu features a tempting selection of seafood and American grill favorites, reminiscent of both Outback Steakhouse and Bonefish Grill.  We dined with a Groupon and were thoroughly impressed with the quality of the food. The calamari appetizer was cooked to perfection, and our entrees were equally delicious.  The generous portions and reasonable prices make this a great value.  We'll definitely be back to explore more of the menu.  \n\n\n", "While this establishment offers an attractive price point and convenient location, the overall dining experience falls short of expectations.\n\n**Positive Aspects:**\n* Affordable pricing\n* Convenient location\n* Satisfactory dessert options\n* Attentive and commendable service provided by our waitress\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n* Quality and freshness of ingredients, particularly at the meat slicing station and the shrimp offerings\n* Authenticity and execution of dishes at the Mexican food station\n* Breakfast offerings, specifically the eggs Benedict, which exhibited consistently subpar quality \n* Steak and breaded items, which were consistently underwhelming \n* Dated and unappealing decor\n\nDespite multiple attempts to overlook its shortcomings, the restaurant failed to deliver a satisfying dining experience. \n\n\n", "This restaurant at Hotel Palomar is a true gem, offering a delightful experience with just one minor hiccup. \n\nWhile a slightly off-putting encounter with a waiter on our first night initially left us hesitant,  we're thrilled we decided to give them another chance.  The bartender, Ben, completely stole the show with his incredible knowledge, genuine warmth, and dedication to crafting the perfect experience. He turned a simple cocktail hour into a memorable and enjoyable event.  \n\nAnd the food!  Don't miss the bacon-wrapped dates and the decadent chocolate cake\u2014both were absolutely divine.  We even ordered room service another night, and the quality was equally impressive.\n\nDespite a small stumble with one staff member, the overall excellence of this restaurant shines through. With its delicious food, fantastic drinks, and exceptional service from individuals like Ben, this restaurant is well worth a visit. \n", "We stumbled upon this gem after a refreshing Sunday morning walk in the park.  The food and coffee were both excellent, and the service was top-notch.  We loved the relaxed and welcoming atmosphere \u2013 a perfect spot to unwind. \n", "Despite its reputation, this establishment fails to deliver a dining experience commensurate with the accolades it receives.  Service was demonstrably slow, and the food quality proved inconsistent. While the seafood jambalaya was satisfactory, the burger, ordered medium-rare, arrived significantly overcooked.  Furthermore, the cost of the meal did not align with the overall quality.  Diners seeking an exceptional culinary experience within the French Quarter are advised to explore alternative venues. \n\n\n", "This hotel offers an exceptional value, boasting comfortable accommodations, a satisfying breakfast, reliable internet access, and a prime location.  While the elevator service can be sluggish from the upper floors, particularly during peak morning hours, this minor inconvenience does not detract significantly from the overall positive experience.  \n\n\n", "Calling this place \"unique\" would be an understatement. Imagine a restaurant where you're the waiter, the busboy, and the bartender all rolled into one! Need some water? Get ready for a refreshing stroll across the yard to fetch it yourself. Thirsty for something stronger? Time to climb a flight of stairs and part with your cash at the bar. \n\nBut hey, at least they bring you the food after you've paid for it at the window \u2013 talk about an adventure! It's like dining in a charmingly chaotic open-air market, complete with live music and a touch of \"rustic\" ambiance (read: dirty lawn chairs and a slightly questionable yard).\n\nLet's just say this is an experience you'll never forget, primarily because you'll likely only do it once. \n\n\n", "This restaurant's a la carte pricing structure caught us off guard. While the food itself was decent, the abundance of additional charges for basic condiments and substitutions quickly added up. \n\nWe were surprised to discover that bottled drinks were the only option for Coke products, and that even simple additions like cheese on a taco or a side of sour cream incurred extra costs. The charges for extras, such as additional chips and various salsas, ultimately exceeded the price of the food itself.  \n\nA word to the wise: be sure to inquire about potential upcharges when ordering, as they are not explicitly stated. \n\n\n", "Despite the cafe's overly cutesy decor, the relentless cheer of a jazz band at 8 am grated on the nerves. My breakfast sandwich, while edible, featured an overly fussy rolled egg that added nothing but unnecessary effort. While cheap, the meal wasn't satisfying enough to warrant a return visit. \n", "This place is nothing short of phenomenal. The duck fat fries were my initial draw, and they did not disappoint.  We were treated like royalty from the moment we walked in, enjoying a pre-dinner cocktail before scoring prime seats at the bar. \n\nOur bartender, Keith, deserves a standing ovation \u2013 his whiskey knowledge and overall coolness only enhanced the experience. The Cape May Salts and tater tots were a perfect way to kick things off, followed by the star of the show: the Kentucky Fried Quail.  While the succotash missed the mark slightly, the quail itself was exceptional. \n\nAnd let's talk about the $24 Foie Gras burger \u2013 worth every single penny.  Honestly, it blew the (still delicious) duck fat fries out of the water!  \n\nGet ready for repeat visits\u2014I'm taking everyone I know to experience this culinary masterpiece. \n", "\"Ugh, where do I even start?  We ordered the artichoke dip, and it was a total miss.  Stone cold and the chips were stale!  We told our waitress, but nothing happened.  Then we got a large thin-crust pizza with a bunch of toppings, and it was crazy expensive for what it was.  Taste was just okay, nothing special.  The server was nice enough, but didn't really have our back with the dip situation.  I've been here before a Cardinals game and it was way better.  Next time, we're definitely trying somewhere else.\"  \n", "We had a really nice birthday dinner at Jasmine Rice!  We were hoping to try the summer rolls, but they weren't available yet.  So instead, we went with the pan-fried dumplings \u2013 pretty tasty, but not our absolute favorite.\n\nThe stars of the show were definitely the green curry fried rice with duck and the chicken pad thai. The duck was seriously amazing \u2013 some of the best I've ever tasted!  The pad thai was a tad sweet for our liking, but still good, especially with a little chili sauce mixed in.\n\nOur server was great, but it seemed like other tables had some hiccups with the service.  One group was in a hurry and had a long wait for their food, and someone else's takeout order was missing a dish.  To be fair, the owner went above and beyond to fix the takeout issue, even hand-delivering the missing item!\n\nOverall, we were really happy with our meal at Jasmine Rice. Delicious Thai food and we'd definitely go back again. \n", "Finding a hairstylist who truly understands your hair and your vision can feel like a revelation.

Finally, a home d\u00e9cor store in Santa Barbara that combines style and affordability! \n\n\n", "My usual Thai order is coconut soup and Pad Thai with a protein, and this place really hit the spot. \n\nTheir coconut soup was fantastic. They used just the right amount of coconut milk, creating a creamy, flavorful broth that wasn't overwhelmed by herbs (which I prefer, except for cilantro).\n\nThe Pad Thai was equally delicious.  I loved the generous amount of peanuts, the perfectly cooked noodles had a great chewy texture, and the overall sweetness was well-balanced.  The portion of chicken was generous, and the white meat was nice and moist. \n\nI left feeling very happy with my meal. \n \n", "This diner offers excellent service, delicious diner fare, and all-day breakfast!  It's conveniently located just off the 295 and despite being busy, the staff is friendly and welcoming. \n\n\n", "Saturdays just haven't been the same since Lucy's closed its doors.  But then, across the street, a beacon of hope emerged! This bar, my new Saturday night sanctuary, not only fills the void but exceeds expectations.  \n\nThe wings and fries? Dangerously addictive (just approach the \"WTF sauce\" with caution).  Yes, the place is always buzzing, making catching the bartender's eye a competitive sport.  But hey, the electric atmosphere and potential for an \"Always Sunny\" crew sighting only add to the appeal.  This is my new home away from home. \n\n\n\n", "We were hesitant to try Shellfish Company on the Wharf, worried it might be a tourist trap with overpriced, mediocre seafood.  But the positive Yelp reviews convinced us to give it a shot.\n\nBe warned, the place is small and popular, so expect a wait, especially during peak hours.  We lucked out with a 20-minute wait as the dinner rush subsided. \n\nThe local rock crab special immediately caught our eye: $25 for 3 pounds of crab, salad, and a choice of soup or chowder.  The sight of other diners happily cracking into their crab sealed the deal. \n\nThe portions were generous \u2013 the salad and chowder combo was a meal in itself.  My wife highly recommends the Shrimp Bisque.\n\nBut let's talk crab! It was absolutely fantastic \u2013 juicy, buttery, and perfectly cooked.  The shells, though thick, were easy to crack, revealing a treasure trove of delicious meat.  Pound for pound, it was some of the easiest crab we've ever enjoyed.\n\nOverall, Shellfish Company was a fantastic experience.  The rock crab special is a steal, and the quality is outstanding.  Don't hesitate\u2014order the crab! \n", "Okay, so I gotta say, I LOVE Weaver's Way. I know some people have their complaints, but it's seriously my jam. \n\nPeople saying it's not convenient? Not my experience at all! As a single lady, I love that I can grab smaller quantities of stuff, which is perfect for one. Plus, the hours work great for me, and I actually enjoy getting my work hours in on the membership committee \u2013 it's a fun way to be involved.\n\nAnd yeah, okay, there are some \"granola\" types, but it's not all tree huggers and earth children, haha!  It's a good mix of people who care about supporting local and eating healthy, which I dig. \n\nHonestly,  the prices are way better than Whole Foods, and the food quality is top-notch. If you're into that whole local, organic vibe and don't mind chipping in a bit (totally doable even as a single person), then you'll love it here. If not, stick to the mega-marts.  No judgment!\n\n\n", "While this BBQ spot doesn't wow me personally, my husband loves it, and many others seem to agree. I'd choose a different BBQ joint, but taste is subjective! \n", "This hotel charges $4.99 for TV shows with commercials and doesn't offer complimentary breakfast, which is disappointing considering the price point. \n\n\n", "This pizza place, conveniently located near my hotel, offers great pizza, friendly service, and a fantastic buy-one-get-one deal.

After over a decade in the STL area, I finally experienced the legendary [Restaurant Name], and let me tell you, I'm drowning in a vat of regret for all those wasted years! \n\nThis place is a straight-up wonderland of beer, food, and good vibes. They've got the whole shebang \u2013 tours, a shop, a bar, live music \u2013 you name it, they've got it! Be prepared for a wait, but trust me, it's worth every second. You'll have plenty to entertain you, from the fascinating brewery views to the people-watching opportunities (just sayin', the staff is a refreshingly eclectic bunch!). \n\nAs for the goods? The Hefeweizen is a must-try, even for non-beer enthusiasts like myself. And the food? Oh, the food! Locally sourced and bursting with flavor. I devoured a spectacular pizza (and let me tell you, I take my pizza seriously), and my date raved about the bison burger. \n\nYes, it's a smidge pricey, but consider it an investment in a fantastic experience.  Do yourself a favor and check it out! You'll thank me later. \n", "This place gets a big fat zero in my book.  I ordered a plain hamburger through the drive-through, took two bites, and realized there was bacon in it\u2014a big problem since I'm allergic. \n\nI went back to the window to complain (didn't realize the actual restaurant was open at that hour), and the guy took the burger without a word and vanished. After awkwardly chatting with the people behind me for a few minutes, he came back and rudely told me to go inside! \n\nNo apology, no explanation, just rude service. I'm never going back, which is a shame because options are limited after downtown.  Guess I'm sticking with Freebirds from now on! \n", "I recently treated my car to its first wash at this establishment, and I was thoroughly impressed!  The car emerged sparkling clean, with no trace of dirt or grime.  The service was prompt, efficient, and incredibly friendly.  From the pre-wash treatment to the final drying, every detail was handled with care. I highly recommend their services and will definitely be back!  \n\n\n", "I recently discovered Sushi Nara, a fantastic new sushi spot that's quickly become my go-to.  The restaurant is spotless, the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful, and the service is lightning-fast.\n\nBut the best part? The sushi is incredibly delicious and surprisingly affordable.  My husband recently grabbed four sushi rolls to go, and the total was only $24! \n\nI'm hooked on the freshness of their ingredients and the huge selection of rolls. If you're on the east side, you need to check this place out!  \n\n\n\n\n", "This specialty automotive shop offers an impressive inventory of rare and hard-to-find parts, with a particular focus on vintage and performance vehicles.  The proprietor possesses extensive knowledge and a passion for automotive mechanics, providing expert guidance and personalized service to each customer.

I've been countless times and the food never disappoints.  Their Panang curry is the best I've had \u2013 absolutely delicious!  I haven't even tried their sister restaurant yet because I can't resist coming back here. \n", "While my initial experience was underwhelming, I'm holding onto hope for this restaurant's intriguing menu and concept.  My tomato-basil soup sadly missed the mark, tasting more like watered-down marinara sauce. The tuna melt, unfortunately, fell victim to an overpowering citrus flavor.  While I appreciate a lemony kick, this was overwhelming, possibly from an excess of zest.\n\nHowever, the menu's enticing descriptions of cured Italian meats, particularly the mortadella and prosciutto, have piqued my interest. The baked goods, especially the Nutella bruschetta, sound divine. I'm willing to give them another try, focusing on these promising dishes. \n", "My friends and I went on an ice cream adventure to this place called \"More Than Just Ice Cream\"!  (We didn't try anything BUT ice cream, but maybe next time!).  \n\nWe got three milkshakes: coffee, chocolate, and a cool black and white one!  They were all yummy, but I wished my coffee one was thicker and creamier!  The black and white one was super thick, so maybe that's the way to go? \n\nOh, and I tried a bite of the pumpkin pie ice cream, and WOW! It was SO good!  I kinda wish I'd gotten that instead.  Maybe milkshakes aren't their thing? \n", "This restaurant made my mother's 100th birthday truly unforgettable!  From the perfect table with a view to the complimentary chef's specials and beautifully presented cake, every detail was exceptional.  The warm, attentive service exceeded our expectations, making this a cherished memory for all of us.  \n\n\n", "This establishment offers a welcoming atmosphere and attentive bartending service.  The burger, featuring fresh, locally sourced ingredients, is highly recommended.  Other menu items appeared equally enticing.  The beverage program showcases well-crafted cocktails and properly chilled beers.  This independent restaurant is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. \n\n\n\n", "Here's the lowdown on this restaurant, a place I ended up frequenting during my recent stay:\n\n**The Good:**\n\n* **Super Convenient:** Located near my hotel and open daily from 11 am to 10:30 pm, even on holidays!\n* **Easy Seating:**  Getting a table for two was a breeze.\n* **Oyster Heaven:** $9 for a dozen oysters is a steal! \n* **Seafood To-Go:**  They have a connected seafood market with boiled and fresh options. \n* **Friendly Service:**  Our server was a gem, recognizing us each time we visited.\n\n**The Not-So-Good:**\n\n* **Mediocre Food:**  We tried a lot, and nothing truly stood out.  The raw oysters weren't cleaned well (Superior Seafood's happy hour oysters are a better deal!), and the turtle soup tasted off.  My boiled shrimp was always partially mushy. \n* **Atmosphere Needs Work:**  While inviting, the ambiance wasn't very comfortable. We usually ate and left.\n* **Bathroom Issues:** Needs a serious scrub! \n\n**Overall:**  I'd likely return for the convenience or to grab seafood to-go, but I wouldn't go out of my way for a sit-down meal. \n\n\n", "Diners beware! A recent visit to [Restaurant Name] revealed a recipe for disaster.  Our seemingly disoriented server left us feeling stranded, neglecting basic requests like setting the table and refilling water glasses. \n\nAdding insult to injury, our chicken parmesan order arrived as eggplant parmesan, a culinary substitution made even more alarming by the presence of a fish bone in the dish. \n\nThe only saving grace? The cocktails. However, we advise seeking refreshment elsewhere until this establishment addresses its service and food safety concerns. \n\n\n", "\"Honestly, \"meh\" pretty much sums up this TDS place.  It's like they forgot to decorate \u2013  no menu boards, just these random stainless steel tables.  And there were employees *everywhere*, but no way to tell who was who! \n\nThe food was decent enough for the price, but get this \u2013 they actually charged us for *extra salsa*!  We got the salsa trio, which was like three tiny bowls, and when my brother asked for more for his tacos, they wanted us to buy the whole thing again! Seriously?!  We spent over 40 bucks there!  \n\nI don't care how good the food is,  I'm not going back to a place that's that stingy with the salsa.  Pass.\" \n", "Capturing life's precious moments in timeless photographs is a gift, and Angela Clifton Photography does it with artistry and heart.  We've had the joy of working with her three times now, and each experience has been incredible.   Beyond the stunning images, it's the joy she brings to the process that sets her apart.  These aren't just photos\u2014they're treasured keepsakes that tell our story, and we're eternally grateful. \n\n\n\n", "I enjoyed a pleasant meal at a sidewalk table, savoring fresh fish in a lively atmosphere. While the prices were a bit high, the food quality was commendable.

Her assistance was invaluable, and her positive demeanor fostered a truly welcoming atmosphere.  Ann's willingness to go above and beyond transformed my first experience into one that has secured my patronage for the foreseeable future.  Thank you for your dedication and commitment to excellence. \n", "I had a fantastic first-time experience at this delightful Thai restaurant!  The combination dinner of Pad Thai and coconut soup was a delicious introduction to their cuisine.  The soup, a first for me, was incredibly flavorful, and the Pad Thai was exactly what I was craving. The restaurant itself boasts a charming ambiance, complete with authentic Thai decor and music.  The service was outstanding,  with a friendly and attentive staff.  This is a welcome addition to Carp's dining scene and will definitely become my new go-to spot! \n\n\n", "This place was a true oasis of tranquility.  The relaxed ambiance was the perfect setting to unwind, and the eclectic live music, including an unexpected country rendition of \"Let It Go,\" added a touch of whimsy to the experience. I'll definitely be adding this gem to my list of must-visit spots. \n\n\n", "There's something incredibly comforting about Chipotle's steak.  It's my go-to remedy whenever my stomach needs a little TLC.  I've learned to avoid the lunch rush, opting instead for the peaceful respite of the late afternoon.  The staff consistently provides friendly and efficient service, ensuring a positive experience whether the restaurant is bustling or tranquil. \n", "Prepare to have your expectations shattered! I stumbled into this unassuming Indian restaurant with zero expectations and left completely floored.  This place is a revelation\u2014a contender for the best Indian cuisine in Tampa Bay, hands down. \n\nThe ambiance is elegant and inviting, with white tablecloths setting the stage for a truly special meal.  And the food! Oh, the food!  The Chicken 65 was a revelation, exploding with flavor. And the hot and sour soup was a masterclass in richness and spice. \n\nOur server, Angel, deserves a standing ovation for her attentiveness and charm. \n\nThey just opened a week ago, but mark my words: This hidden gem won't stay hidden for long. Run, don't walk, to experience the culinary magic for yourself!\n\n\n\n\n", "After two failed attempts, thwarted by the legendary lines, I finally experienced the magic of Preservation Hall! This time, we outsmarted the system, snagging reserved seats and bypassing the hour-long queue. Trust me, those extra $20 are worth every penny\u2014consider it a donation to the soul of jazz.\n\nThe performance was absolutely electrifying.  The musicians, decked out in dapper suits, oozed talent and charisma. They transported us back in time, their melodies swirling around the intimate, dimly lit room.  Imagine an authentic jazz speakeasy, crammed with barely 200 souls, the air thick with anticipation and the echoes of history.  You could see the joy in the musicians' eyes as they shared their craft, their infectious energy washing over the audience.\n\nThis isn't just a concert\u2014it's a pilgrimage, a must-do experience that captures the heart and soul of New Orleans.  \n\n\n", "Keystone Discount Tire provided efficient and satisfactory service during my recent visit for a Pennsylvania State & Emissions inspection.  Despite my lack of an appointment, I was accommodated promptly. The staff's transparency and communication were commendable, particularly during a brief inspection of my vehicle's tire wear. The inspection process was completed efficiently, and I appreciated the absence of unnecessary upselling.  Based on this positive experience, I would recommend their services.  \n\n\n", "I was heartbroken when my son dropped his phone, thinking it was a goner. But these guys worked miracles! In less than 30 minutes, they had it looking and working like new.  They were professional, efficient, and incredibly skilled. I can't recommend them enough! \n\n\n", "This Cracker Barrel experience was a complete nightmare. They messed up all four of our orders, and when we politely pointed it out, our waiter completely lost it, resorting to offensive language. The manager, in a feeble attempt to salvage the situation, offered us free drinks \u2013 a pathetic consolation for the disaster we endured.\n\nThe food itself was cold, unappetizing, and barely touched.  We wasted over an hour of our lives in that culinary abyss.  Consider this a warning: steer clear of this Cracker Barrel if you value your sanity and your taste buds.  This experience has put me off the entire chain for good. \n", "As a frequent traveler with my canine companion, I am accustomed to a wide range of \"dog-friendly\" accommodations.  However, the Loews Hotel exceeded all expectations, redefining the standard for pet-inclusive hospitality. \n\nUpon entering, I was immediately put at ease by the welcoming demeanor of the reception staff.  Their genuine warmth extended to my Labrador-Golden Retriever mix, Bentley, who was greeted with treats and offered a complimentary welcome kit.  The thoughtful inclusion of dog dishes, a mat, and treats demonstrated an exceptional level of attention to detail.  \n\nThroughout our stay, Bentley was treated like royalty by both staff and guests alike. The spacious top-floor room provided ample space, and even the car attendants addressed Bentley by name.  \n\nThe Loews Hotel's genuine commitment to creating a welcoming and comfortable environment for both canine and human guests is highly commendable.  Their thoughtful amenities and exceptional service transformed our stay into a truly exceptional experience. \n", "While this establishment has demonstrated the capacity for producing excellent cuisine, consistency appears to be an ongoing challenge.  The quality of the dishes can vary noticeably, suggesting potential inconsistencies within the kitchen staff.  This lack of reliability, despite the potential for exceptional meals, is a significant drawback. \n\n\n", "My recent experience at Cheu Noodle Bar left me with a sense of introspection rather than disappointment.  Having explored a variety of ramen establishments, I've come to appreciate the nuances of different styles.  While Cheu's thick noodles and intensely flavorful broth weren't entirely to my taste, I recognize that my preference doesn't negate the restaurant's merits. \n\nThe service was excellent, and their beer selection was impressive.  My dining companion, a self-proclaimed Cheu enthusiast, thoroughly enjoyed their meal.  Perhaps my palate simply gravitates towards a different style of ramen. \n\nI encourage others to explore Cheu's offerings and form their own opinions.  Taste is subjective, after all, and what might not resonate with me could be another diner's culinary delight. \n\n\n\n\n", "Calling all foodies!

It's crazy fast, so I can get my salad fix without sacrificing my precious lunch break.  \n\n\n\n\n", "On September 26, 2015, we participated in the Oak Alley and Laura Plantation tour.  Our driver provided informative commentary during the journey. The tour's schedule allowed ample free time to explore both plantations before and after the guided tours.  Additionally, the tour offered flexibility with drop-off locations, enabling us to disembark near Jackson Square and enjoy the remainder of the afternoon in the French Quarter. \n\n\n", "This place has yummy brunch! We loved everything we tried, especially the cheesy grits with green onions on top!  Just a heads up, it's always super cold inside, so make sure you bring a sweater or you'll turn into a popsicle! \n\n\n", "This unassuming hot dog joint has earned a devoted fan in me! Their expertly grilled, all-beef franks boast a satisfying snap and a perfect char. Their chili dogs are the stuff of legend, featuring a secret recipe chili that strikes a harmonious balance of savory, spicy, and slightly sweet notes. The buns are toasted to golden perfection, providing the ideal vessel for these culinary masterpieces. I indulge in this guilty pleasure whenever humanly possible! \n\n\n\n\n", "Topa Topa Brewing Company's Waterline location is a welcome addition to the local craft beer scene.  The ambiance is inviting, featuring live music performances and a communal atmosphere.  Their selection of beers demonstrates a commitment to quality and craftsmanship, surpassing other local breweries in terms of flavor and complexity. \n\nThe integrated dining experience, with convenient access to the Nook Restaurant and Lama Dog, enhances the venue's appeal.  The synergy between these establishments within the Waterline complex creates a dynamic and enjoyable environment for patrons. \n\n\n", "This airboat tour was the highlight of our trip!  From the moment we booked, their customer service was top-notch. They went above and beyond to accommodate our group of seven, even though we were slightly outside their usual pick-up area.  When a billing error occurred, they quickly refunded the extra ticket with no hassle.\n\nThe tour itself was an absolute blast! Our guide was hilarious and kept us entertained the entire time. We saw a ton of alligators, from tiny babies to massive adults!  We even got to hold a rescued baby alligator that our guide was hand-rearing.  \n\nThe airboat ride itself was a thrill ride, especially on the way back when our guide showed off some impressive maneuvers.

They replaced our roof in April, and we were blown away by their professionalism and workmanship. From the quality of the materials to the excellent communication and follow-up, they exceeded our expectations. Choosing Westfall was the best decision!\n\n\n", "This establishment offers a commendable selection of affordably priced vegan cuisine. While the dining area is modest, their emphasis on efficient service aligns with their quick-service concept.  While the Buffalo Bella appears to be a popular choice, I highly recommend the Cheesesteak.  Additionally, the sweet potato fries are an excellent accompaniment. \n\n\n\n", "I've found myself at this unassuming ramen shop twice now. It's not that the ramen is bad \u2013 it's perfectly decent, just not mind-blowing.  The service is fine, nothing extraordinary.  Honestly, it's my go-to when I need a quick bite and options are limited. Will I actively seek it out? Probably not. But will I find myself slurping down a bowl of their ramen again sometime?  Quite possibly.  It's the reliable friend you keep around, even if they're not the life of the party. \n\n\n", "Prepare to have your brunch dreams come true! This restaurant is a culinary haven, boasting a menu that caters to every craving imaginable.  The atmosphere is effortlessly chic, and the food is as delicious as it is beautiful. \n\nWhile arriving before 9 am is advisable to avoid a queue, trust me, the food is well worth the wait.

This is more than just a meal \u2013 it's an experience that will nourish your body and soul. \n\n\n", "This place offers incredible barbecue at a great price!  The brisket sandwich, two sides, and a drink deal for $9.99 is a steal.  Don't miss out on their delicious sides, including potato casserole, creamed spinach, and baked beans. \n\n\n", "This establishment offers commendable cuisine and exemplary service.  However, the absence of vegetarian and vegan options represents a significant oversight and limits its inclusivity.  We encourage the restaurant to expand its menu to cater to a broader range of dietary preferences. \n\n\n", "This place is a culinary Jekyll and Hyde \u2013 delicious food served up with a side of grumpy waitresses.  Imagine navigating a minefield of passive-aggressive sighs and eye rolls just to get your order in.  The owner, thankfully, is a ray of sunshine in this otherwise overcast dining experience.  \n\n\n\n\n", "This business displayed an appalling lack of professionalism and a blatant disregard for our time. Despite confirming a full detailing appointment with Michael twice, he claimed ignorance upon our arrival. After agreeing to reschedule, we arrived promptly at 8 am to find the workshop closed and Michael absent.  \n\nDespite waiting for over an hour, both in person and via phone, Michael remained unreachable.  His partner, arriving late himself, was unable to contact him.  \n\nThis blatant disregard for appointments and basic communication is unacceptable.  We strongly advise seeking automotive services elsewhere. \n\n\n", "My recent move involved a few unexpected hiccups that required extra assistance from this moving company. I cannot speak highly enough about their team!  They went above and beyond to ensure a smooth and stress-free experience. While I hesitate to share specific details for fear of appearing hyperbolic, their dedication to customer satisfaction and genuine care were truly remarkable. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to my own family. \n", "Our girls' trip to The Saint Hotel last year quickly went downhill.  The lobby was gorgeous, the bar and restaurant were trendy, and the staff seemed friendly \u2013  everything seemed perfect. \n\nI arrived first and settled into our room to get some work done.  A few hours later, my friend arrived, and we headed out for a fun night in NOLA.  When we returned, we were greeted by a HUGE cockroach in our room! I immediately went to the front desk, totally freaked out. They moved us to another room, but it was also dirty \u2013  dead bugs, a broken TV, and a missing lightbulb!  \n\nBy then, it was 3 am, and I'd had enough.  I booked us a room at The W Hotel, our usual spot.  The next morning, we demanded a refund and told them about all the issues. The manager apologized, but the damage was done. We definitely won't be back! \n\n\n", "\"Okay, let's say you're like, 'I need a new door, stat!' but you've only got 35 bucks to your name. Where do you go?  The Green Project!

The restaurant was spotless, the food was absolutely delicious, and the prices were incredibly reasonable.  We can't wait to go back and try more!  \n\n\n", "Members of the board, esteemed colleagues, I must express my profound disappointment with the steep decline in quality at this once-esteemed establishment.  \n\nOur recent dining experience was marred by a series of culinary missteps. The artichoke appetizer was demonstrably pre-prepared, lacking the freshness one expects.  My wife's Greek salad consisted of lackluster, pre-packaged ingredients doused in a flavorless dressing.  \n\nMost egregious was the grilled yellowtail, which was tragically overcooked, suggesting a reliance on frozen and inferior-quality seafood. Such disregard for culinary standards is unacceptable, particularly in a market like Santa Barbara. \n\nWhile the ambiance and service remain commendable, they are ultimately overshadowed by the abysmal quality of the food.  Without a significant and immediate improvement in culinary standards, this establishment risks becoming indistinguishable from a tourist trap, devoid of the excellence it once embodied.  \n\n\n", "Milktooth is a must-try for brunch lovers seeking a departure from the ordinary.  Their menu is a playful twist on tradition, featuring unique dishes that might surprise you. Trust me, though, every bite is an adventure!\n\nBe prepared for a wait, especially on weekends, but they've got you covered with a walk-up bar serving coffee and pastries. It's a delicious way to preview the culinary delights to come!\n\nWhile their menu changes seasonally, their Dutch baby pancakes and the raclette grilled cheese are perennial favorites that never disappoint. And if you're in the mood for a boozy brunch, their michelada is a must-try.  If the weather's cooperating, grab a table outside and enjoy! \n\n\n\n", "This hotel boasts a fantastic bar and amazing staff, and we even scored a honeymoon upgrade with a stunning view!  The room itself, however, was a bit disappointing, with some rust and stains in the bathroom.  Valet parking was pricey, so we opted for street parking a few blocks away. Overall, a great location for exploring downtown St. Louis, especially on a Friday night, but don't expect luxury accommodations. \n\n\n\n\n", "I loved my first class here!

They executed a minor mirror repair with remarkable ease, demonstrating the same commitment to customer satisfaction that I experienced at their Charlotte location.  Their promptness and proficiency are truly commendable. \n", "This Union Station restaurant offers a decent dining experience.  The Ponchartrain (a tilapia dish) with mushrooms and cream sauce was quite good. While the shrimp cocktail and crab cake appetizers were satisfactory, they lacked a certain wow factor. Service and drinks were good, and the patio provided a pleasant atmosphere. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "This place is an absolute must-visit!  From the moment you walk in, you'll be transported to a magical, Harry Potter-esque world.

While the food is decent for takeout, the lamb kebab was bland and uninspired. \n\n\n", "This Middle Eastern restaurant consistently serves high-quality food that many patrons find satisfying.  \n\n\n", "Let me tell you about a cannoli revelation that changed my life. Forget the long lines and overhyped names\u2014Potito's is the true cannoli king of this city.\n\nI've been a loyal devotee for years, making my annual pilgrimage every Christmas Eve.  This year, after enduring a two-hour wait for a mediocre tiramisu at the wildly overrated Isgro's, I strolled into Potito's and straight into cannoli heaven.  Their \"bambino cannoli stuffed cannoli\" is a symphony of creamy, ricotta-filled goodness\u2014a masterpiece that puts all others to shame.\n\nTrust me, this is a cannoli experience you won't forget.  Potito's has earned my unwavering loyalty, and one bite will have you singing their praises too. \n", "El Limon is a true gem for anyone craving authentic, delicious Mexican food in Pennsylvania!  This cozy restaurant is a fiesta of flavor, serving up mouthwatering dishes that transport you straight to the heart of Mexico.\n\nTheir sopes, tostadas, enchiladas, fajitas, burritos, and fish tacos are all absolutely incredible, and the prices are incredibly reasonable.

While still ironing out a few opening-week kinks, [Restaurant Name] is poised for greatness.  \n\nOur investigative taste buds have sampled a variety of menu items, and the results are overwhelmingly positive.  Their signature sandwiches, particularly the Quaker (Chicken version), impress with fresh ingredients and flavorful execution. Sides like fries and onion rings are crispy and crave-worthy, while the spanakopita and baklava showcase a commitment to authentic Mediterranean flavors.\n\nThe (turkey) Greek Burger is a standout, featuring a moist, flavorful patty and a delectable homemade tzatziki sauce. \n\nThough pizza appears to be their Achilles' heel, we remain optimistic about this establishment's potential.  Their dedication to quality ingredients and willingness to address customer concerns suggest a bright future.  Stay tuned for updates as this culinary newcomer continues to evolve. \n\n\n", "Planet Fitness is a great value for the price, especially with its 24-hour access.

While it may lack the hardcore bodybuilding atmosphere of other gyms, it's a great option for those seeking affordability and convenience. \n\n\n\n\n", "Talk about a major bummer!  We showed up on Saturday at 2:15, ready to feast, only to be told the kitchen closed at 2!  Their website clearly says they're open all day Saturday and Sunday until 5 pm.  \n\nSeriously?  If they can't even get their hours right, it makes you wonder what else they're dropping the ball on.

Over those months, I realized how much I looked forward to our chats.  She was such a great listener, and her advice and suggestions really resonated with me, especially as I was expecting again.  \n\nRebecca's honest and supportive, which I really appreciated. You can tell she's passionate about her work as a doula, and she sees the beauty and strength in every birth. She would be an amazing addition to any support team!  \n\n\n", "My recent experience with Orange Tint and Tune was exceptional, exceeding expectations in terms of both service and quality.  Their convenient car pick-up service, available within a four-mile radius, eliminated the hassle of drop-off and pick-up. \n\nCarlos, my assigned technician, patiently guided me through the various tinting options, demonstrating a keen understanding of my desired aesthetic.  He even adjusted the tint grade to perfectly match my vision\u2014a testament to their commitment to customer satisfaction. \n\nBeyond Carlos' expertise, the receptionist's warm welcome and owner Dustin's personal follow-up solidified my positive impression.

It's conveniently located near the airport without being noisy, making it a peaceful option. The rooms are standard for the brand, offering a kitchenette with a fridge and stove.  \n\nThe surrounding area is a quiet mix of hotels and offices, about a 20-minute drive from downtown and the university.  The Pima Air Museum is just 5-10 minutes away, which is a bonus for aviation enthusiasts. \n\nWhile restaurant options are limited nearby, there are a few fast food choices and a great sandwich spot called Baggins within walking distance. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful, and the breakfast offered a standard continental spread with a couple of hot items.\n\nThey also host a weekday evening reception, which could easily serve as a light dinner.  However, I recommend arriving early, as food and drinks tend to run out quickly.  \n\nOverall, this hotel offers comfortable rooms, a safe location, and friendly service, making it a solid choice for business travelers.  \n\n\n", "An unexpected layover in Tampa led us to a culinary revelation!  Determined to avoid the usual chain restaurants, we followed Yelp's guidance to this local gem, and what a find it was! \n\nThe oak and citrus wood-grilled steaks were nothing short of extraordinary.  As avid home smokers, we know the magic of wood-fired flavor, and this place nailed it.  The 7oz Tampa strip and 14oz ribeyes were cooked to perfection, each bite a symphony of smoky goodness. \n\nThe sides, featuring fresh veggies and sweet potatoes, were the perfect complement.  And the wine list?  A refreshing departure from the usual inflated markups\u2014a decent selection with most bottles under $20!\n\nOur server, Lisa, was a true delight, offering warm hospitality and spot-on recommendations.

The sheer variety of choices is astounding, each creation a testament to their passion for flavor and craftsmanship. \n\nTheir legendary muffuletta, a symphony of Italian meats, cheeses, and olive salad, is a feast for the senses\u2014easily enough to satisfy four hungry souls. Live music on Thursday and Saturday nights elevates the ambiance, creating a lively and convivial atmosphere.\n\nTheir daily specials are always a delight, and the selection of sides, from the hearty chili to the creamy potato salad, complements the sandwiches perfectly.  This deli is a true gem, a must-visit for anyone seeking a taste of culinary excellence. \n\n\n\n\n", "Our cross-country road trip led us to the breathtaking Saguaro National Park, where we had the pleasure of joining a tour led by the remarkable Park Ranger Carolyn.  Carolyn's passion for the iconic saguaro cactus was contagious, and her extensive knowledge enriched our experience immeasurably. \n\nShe shared fascinating insights into the cactus's life cycle, its vital role in the desert ecosystem, and the threats it faces.

You might even catch a glimpse of Skip, adding to the authentic New Orleans charm. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Tom Jones Restaurant remains a classic! The previously mentioned ATM-style payment machine is gone, replaced by standard ATMs at the entrance.  The iconic Blue Ribbon breakfast special is now $3.79, still a steal for the generous portions of pancakes, eggs, toast, sausage, bacon, juice, and coffee.\n\nThe menu offers a wide variety of choices, from classic diner fare to sandwiches and baked potatoes.

Highly recommended for anyone seeking a delicious and satisfying dining experience. \n\n\n\n\n", "My experience at Trust Me BBQ was a mixed bag, leaving me with a sense of disappointment rather than excitement.  While the BBQ sauce and macaroni salad were standouts, the overall experience was marred by inconsistent food quality and indifferent service.  \n\nThe silent and disengaged demeanor of the counter staff created an impersonal atmosphere, lacking the warmth and hospitality one typically associates with barbecue joints.  The errors in our order, coupled with the dryness of the chicken and the seemingly stale mac & cheese, reinforced my doubts.  \n\nPerhaps my expectations were overly optimistic, fueled by the countless positive reviews.  However, based on my personal experience, I'll likely stick with Down to the Bone BBQ, where the consistency and customer service align more closely with my preferences. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "During a recent visit, I dined at this small, unassuming restaurant.  The Panang chicken, ordered with one-star spice level, was flavorful and arrived promptly.

Their Cinco de Mayo celebrations are a testament to their expertise in crafting festive drinks and flavorful dishes.\n\nThe on-the-rocks margaritas and homemade sangrias, available in both white and red, are highly recommended.  Their commitment to quality extends to their recently opened wine bar, offering overflow seating and a selection of specialty bottles. \n\nWhether you're seeking a celebratory drink or a unique culinary experience, this establishment is worth a visit.  \n\n\n\n\n", "Tucked away in one of Hermitage's oldest shopping centers, you'll find a tiny donut shop that's big on flavor.

Don't forget to grab a cup of coffee to complete your donut experience!\n\n\n\n\n\n", "While we've attended various events here, ranging from concerts to basketball games, the experience has been consistently underwhelming.  The promised \"fun\" felt manufactured and lacked genuine excitement.  The food, though featuring local favorites, was unremarkable and overpriced. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "The food at this restaurant is excellent! Every dish we tried, from appetizers to entrees, was a hit.  Prices are reasonable, service is good, and we'll definitely be back.  \n\n\n\n\n", "This place used to be our go-to, but sadly, the service has really slipped.  We've had too many experiences with slow and inattentive staff.  We've moved on to another spot that appreciates our business. \n\n\n\n\n", "My quest for a healthy and delicious chicken and rice plate took a disappointing turn at this establishment. Despite assurances of sauce-free preparation, my to-go order arrived swimming in an ocean of oil, contradicting their \"healthy\" slogan. \n\nThis experience serves as a stark reminder to approach seemingly healthy options with caution and to prioritize establishments that demonstrate a genuine commitment to transparency and quality. \n\n\n\n\n\n", "This appliance retailer offers a wide selection of washers and dryers, knowledgeable sales staff, and timely delivery service.

The mushroom cheesesteak was absolutely delicious. \n\n\n", "If you're seeking a great Americano and a chill atmosphere, this is your spot. Their espresso is excellent, and the staff is as friendly as the laid-back vibes. While you won't find any power outlets, the wifi is free and unlimited, making it perfect for a quick coffee break.  The cafe is always impeccably clean, including the restrooms. \n", "My high hopes for this establishment, fueled by glowing reviews, were quickly dashed. The online experience was the first red flag. Their website, lacking a comprehensive menu, offered only cryptic listings like \"Roast Beef\" and \"Roast Beef Combo\" with no descriptions or prices.  Even the table place cards, while slightly more informative, failed to clarify what constituted a \"combo.\" (Spoiler alert: it just means they add cheese.)\n\nThe ambiance leans more towards a bar than a restaurant, with a limited number of tables.  Intrigued by the affordable price of $6.85 per sandwich, I ordered both the roast beef and roast pork combos.\n\nThe food arrived promptly, but to my surprise, the roast beef was cold while the roast pork was steaming hot.  This inconsistency suggests a lack of attention to detail in the kitchen.  Despite requesting a reheat, the roast beef remained disappointingly lukewarm.\n\nBoth sandwiches were underwhelming, skimpy on meat and drowning in gravy, rendering the bread soggy and unstable. Their menu's \"wet meat\" option, with less gravy, seems like a wise choice to avoid this structural and flavor imbalance. \n\nOverall, my experience was underwhelming.  The lack of clarity on the menu, inconsistent food temperatures, and excessive gravy detract from the potential appeal of this establishment. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Here are the key points about the takeout experience from Village Whiskey:\n\n* **Whiskey Burger:**\n    * Pricey at $26\n    * Delicious, but on the greasy side\n    * Very tender with excellent bacon\n    * Large portion \n    * Highly recommended if you're okay with the price\n\n* **Duck Fat Fries:**\n    * Rich and delicious \n", "We splurged on a family feast from this place, and it was worth every penny!  The food arrived piping hot, and their orange chicken was seriously the best I've had in ages.  This is officially our new go-to for Asian food! \n", "Doing laundry usually isn't something to get excited about, but let me tell you, this laundromat was a revelation!  I typically wash clothes at my boyfriend's place, but after hosting family, I was drowning in a sea of towels, sheets, and comforters.  I needed a laundromat, but safety and cleanliness were top priorities.\n\nThankfully, this place checked all the boxes and then some. It was bright, spotless, and had a friendly, welcoming atmosphere. The staff was amazing \u2013 super helpful and always around if you needed anything.\n\nBut the best part?

Thank you, LAUNDROMAT, for making a mundane chore surprisingly pleasant!\n\n\n\n", "We tried this place for a late dinner, but honestly, it wasn't worth the splurge.  The prices were pretty steep, so we ended up splitting plates (which didn't seem to thrill our server). The food was good, but not mind-blowing enough to justify the cost. \n\nThe highlight? The garlic bread! It was seriously incredible \u2013 I could have eaten a whole loaf myself! \n\nOverall, I wouldn't rush back.  St. Louis has so many amazing restaurants, and there are better options for the price. \n\n\n\n\n", "This place was buzzing with excitement during the Seahawks/Saints game!  No surprise there \u2013 their burgers are incredible!  I snagged the Haven Burger, and it was a total touchdown! \n\nThe place was packed, and the crowd just kept growing.  Getting out was like navigating a human maze, but hey, that's a testament to their popularity!  \n\nI'll definitely be back, but maybe for a more laid-back lunch on a Tuesday.  This place is a winner! \n\n\n\n\n\n", "While I haven't ventured into their Ph\u1edf offerings yet, I've become a regular for their vermicelli bowls.  They're generously portioned, reasonably priced, and incredibly convenient for those in the Alberta Ave neighborhood.  Even on busy Friday nights, my orders have always been ready within 15 minutes, making this a reliable option for a quick and satisfying meal. \n\n\n", "Our dining experience was a mixed bag.  While the atmosphere was lively and the live music made for a fun night of dancing, the food sadly missed the mark. \n\nMy Chicken Marsala, recommended by our waiter, was a disappointment. The chicken was thin, tough, and dry, while the pasta was undercooked and clumpy, lacking any real flavor. My friend's lasagna was equally underwhelming, with a meager layer of pasta and a distinct lack of seasoning.\n\nTo top it off, they cleared my friend's plate while she was in the restroom, despite her explicitly stating that she wasn't finished. While they did replace her meal to-go, the overall service felt careless.\n\nConsidering the high prices, the poor quality of the food was unacceptable.
