  "If you decide to eat here, just be aware it is going to take about 2 hours from beginning to end. We have tried it multiple times, because I want to like it! I have been to it's other locations in NJ and never had a bad experience.   The food is good, but it takes a very long time to come out. The waitstaff is very young, but usually pleasant. We have just had too many experiences where we spent way too long waiting. We usually opt for another diner or restaurant on the weekends, in order to be done quicker.",
  "I've taken a lot of spin classes over the years, and nothing compares to the classes at Body Cycle. From the nice, clean space and amazing bikes, to the welcoming and motivating instructors, every class is a top notch work out.  For anyone who struggles to fit workouts in, the online scheduling system makes it easy to plan ahead (and there's no need to line up way in advanced like many gyms make you do).  There is no way I can write this review without giving Russell, the owner of Body Cycle, a shout out. Russell's passion for fitness and cycling is so evident, as is his desire for all of his clients to succeed. He is always dropping in to classes to check in/provide encouragement, and is open to ideas and recommendations from anyone. Russell always wears a smile on his face, even when he's kicking your butt in class!",
  "Family diner. Had the buffet. Eclectic assortment: a large chicken leg, fried jalapeño, tamale, two rolled grape leaves, fresh melon. All good. Lots of Mexican choices there. Also has a menu with breakfast served all day long. Friendly, attentive staff. Good place for a casual relaxed meal with no expectations. Next to the Clarion Hotel.",
  "Wow!  Yummy, different,  delicious.   Our favorite is the lamb curry and korma.  With 10 different kinds of naan!!!  Don't let the outside deter you (because we almost changed our minds)...go in and try something new!   You'll be glad you did!",
  "Cute interior and owner (?) gave us tour of upcoming patio/rooftop area which will be great on beautiful days like today. Cheese curds were very good and very filling. Really like that sandwiches come w salad, esp after eating too many curds! Had the onion, gruyere, tomato sandwich. Wasn't too much cheese which I liked. Needed something else...pepper jelly maybe. Would like to see more menu options added such as salads w fun cheeses. Lots of beer and wine as well as limited cocktails. Next time I will try one of the draft wines.",
  "I am a long term frequent customer of this establishment. I just went in to order take out (3 apps) and was told they're too busy to do it. Really? The place is maybe half full at best. Does your dick reach your ass? Yes? Go fuck yourself! I'm a frequent customer AND great tipper. Glad that Kanella just opened. NEVER going back to dmitris!",
  "Loved this tour! I grabbed a groupon and the price was great. It was the perfect way to explore New Orleans for someone who'd never been there before and didn't know a lot about the history of the city. Our tour guide had tons of interesting tidbits about the city, and I really enjoyed the experience. Highly recommended tour. I actually thought we were just going to tour through the cemetery, but she took us around the French Quarter for the first hour, and the cemetery for the second half of the tour. You'll meet up in front of a grocery store (seems strange at first, but it's not terribly hard to find, and it'll give you a chance to get some water), and you'll stop at a visitor center part way through the tour for a bathroom break if needed. This tour was one of my favorite parts of my trip!",
  "Amazingly amazing wings and homemade bleu cheese. Had the ribeye: tender, perfectly prepared, delicious. Nice selection of craft beers. Would DEFINITELY recommend checking out this hidden gem.",
  "This easter instead of going to Lopez Lake we went to Los Padres National Forest which is really pretty but if you go to white rock the staff needs to cut down all the dead grass that invades the rock and the water. I would wish the staff would also clean or get rid of the dead grass that's also living by the water. The water is really green and dirty. Los padres national forest staff need to work hard to maintain this forest looking pretty and not like a dumpster. Even Cachuma lake looks like they put a bit more effort.",
  "Had a party of 6 here for hibachi. Our waitress brought our separate sushi orders on one plate so we couldn't really tell who's was who's and forgot several items on an order. I understand making mistakes but the restaraunt was really quiet so we were kind of surprised. Usually hibachi is a fun lively experience and our  cook  said maybe three words, but he cooked very well his name was Francisco. Service was fishy, food was pretty good, and im hoping it was just an off night here. But for the money I wouldn't go back.",
  "My experience with Shalimar was nothing but wonderful.  I wanted to get my engagement ring sized and was told over the phone that it could probably be done within the day.  When I brought it by, the team confirmed that the jeweler would be able to accommodate my same-day request and that it would be around $40 (simple band, decrease by three full sizes). I checked my size one more time, confirmed, and left to let them do their thing. When I came to pick up later that afternoon, the ring was too small. It's very important to note that Shalimar sized the ring perfectly, but that I made a mistake and should've gone up a half-size. The Shalimar group were completely understanding and accommodating, even resizing my ring back up and getting it back to me within an hour at no charge! Even though it was my mistake! The associates' attitudes in dealing with what was a pretty embarrassing situation instantly earned my satisfaction and loyalty as a customer. Very grateful for such a wonderful experience.",
  "Locals recommended Milktooth, and it's an amazing jewel of Indianapolis. I'm glade I had the chance to experience this.",
  "Love going here for happy hour or dinner!  Great patio with fans to beat the StL heat!   Also...very accomodating at this location.  I like the Veal Milanese but with mixed greens instead of pasta!  they'll modify the menu to suit your taste!",
  "Good food--loved the gnocchi with marinara the baked eggplant appetizer was very good too  The service was very slow, but despite this, I'd go back, the food is just that good",
  "The bun makes the Sonoran Dog. It's like a snuggie for the pup. A first, it seems ridiculous and almost like it's going to be too much, exactly like everyone's favorite blanket with sleeves. Too much softness, too much smush, too indulgent.  Wrong. It's warm, soft, chewy, fragrant, and it succeeds where other famed Sonoran Dogs fail.   The hot dog itself is flavorful, but I would prefer that it or the bacon have a little more bite or snap to better hold their own against the dominant mustard and onions.   I'm with the masses on the carne asada caramelo. Excellent tortilla, salty, melty cheese, and great carne.   Super cheap and you can drive through.",
  "Great place for breakfast! I had the waffle, which was fluffy and perfect, and home fries which were nice and smashed and crunchy. Friendly waitstaff. Will definitely be back!",
  "Tremendous service (Big shout out to Douglas) that complemented the delicious food. Pretty expensive establishment (40-50$ avg for your main course), but its definitely backs that up with an atmosphere that's comparable with any of the top tier restaurants across the country.",
  "The hubby and I have been here on multiple occasions and we have loved every part of the meal, every single time. Everyone from the servers to the bartender is very knowledgable about the menu and was able to immediately recommend items I could eat as-is, substitute or delete to make something safe for this Celiac girl to eat. The wine and cocktail menus are spot on. The food divine.  My only wish is that they would have a gluten-free dessert, we've always had to go elsewhere for something sweet. But that is not a big deal and I still want to go here time and time again.",
  "I go to blow bar to get my brows done by natalie (brow specialist) which i highly recommend she is great does a great job on my eyebrows! But then i got a blow by victoria!! Wow i was impress i have thin, straight, dead hair and she left me with the biggest volume ive ever had!!! Tried another girl but didnt like it as much so victoria will be my girl for ever; very beautiful clean place!!!",
  "My absolute favorite cafe in the city. Their black and white latte is probably the best I've ever had (not too sweet and just the right amount of foam), soups are always really good (even for non-soup people) and there's just a lot of space to do work. The noise level is perfect, the music is at a perfect level, and I always enjoy when patrons bring their dogs. I'll keep giving them my business for as long as I can.",
  "HOLY SMOKES!  actual pumpkin pie mixed in with the frozen custard......are you kidding me? Why hasn't this become a huge sweep the nation treat.   The best part was the chunks of pie crust. Like finding a diamond inside another diamond. Super yummy.",
  "Upland is a brewery based out of Bloomington, Indiana that has become popular enough to open up a couple additional locations in central Indiana.  All of their beers are very good, and I am also a fan of their burgers and tenderloins.  Therefore, I was excited to try their pizza, but I don't think it ended up being on par with these other items.  My margherita pizza had a cracker-like crust and was pretty light overall.  The cheese was good, but none of the other toppings added much flavor.  There was no red sauce as is typical for a true margherita pizza.  My opinion is that Upland's pizza might serve as a nice appetizer for a group, but I'll be sticking with their burgers or tenderloins as my meal of choice on future visits.",
  "I thoroughly enjoyed the show.  Chill way to spend a Friday night.",
  "Yes, this is the only sushi place in town. However, it is great when you're craving sushi and don't have time to go somewhere else. The salmon is probably the best fish they have, so we always order salmon. We also love their spicy edamame, tempura, ocean salad, and cabbage salad. Service has always been friendly and quick!",
  "I was really between 3 and 4 stars for this one. I LOVE the 96th street Naked Tchopstix so I was very excited to see this one which is closer to my house. The vibe is totally different as this is geared more to take out although they do have a decent size dining area. You order at the counter and they deliver it. My daughter and I tried the sushi bowl. You pick up a piece of paper and  select from a choice of proteins, vegetables, rice and toppings. I like the fact that it is on paper and you don't have to guess what things are or have to shout over the counter to tell the server what you want. The sushi bowl was good but not wonderful. The choices particularly of the vegetables seemed a little too limiting and I felt I had more rice than other food items. The sauces were tasty. My husband ordered the Maui roll which is my favorite roll at the 96th street location and this just was not up that standard. It was good but the quality and consistently was not as good as at 96th street. I would go back though and I think a lot of people would be happy with the sushi bowls. I do want to make a comment about the low reviews that people have given the place because of service. People - it is a sushi place - it isn't McDonalds- so it will be a bit slower. You are not going to order and get out of there in five minutes even though it is called express. As a healthy alternative to fast food in the area, it is worth the wait. Oh and try the bubble tea. I had the strawberry and it was quite yummy. Next time I am going to try the vanilla chai.",
  "Went for lunch. Beef brisket sandwich was awesome.   So juicy and tender.    Pulled pork was was just as good!",
  "Best thai food in the area.  Everything was authentic and delicious.  Will definitely be back again and again.",
  "Service was crappy, and food was mediocre.  I wish I would have picked some other place for my last dinner in town.",
  "I recently had dinner here with my wife over the weekend and could not have been more pleased!   Our meal was excellent! My wife and I were astounded by how quickly our food came out! Everything tasted fresh and homemade which we both appreciated.   The only problem was trying to pick something from the menu as there were too many delicious sounding items to choose from. We will definitely be returning to try more items! Can't wait to see what the next chef specials will be!",
  "I at least have to give this restaurant two stars due to the decent food. But while on a dinner meeting and after spending $100 on entrées and appetizers, I had to flag down the assistant cook, (the guy in bright red baggy pants watching TV), to see if I could get more avocado for my tuna entrée.  He made it very apparent and direct that he could not help me with that situation and I would have to flag down my  waitress so she could bill me for the four dollar avocado.",
  "First time there and it was excellent!!! It feels like your are entering someone's home. The waiters there funny and nice. The food come out very quickly and it is phenomenal!!! Definitely will be going back to this place.",
  "Great burgers,fries and salad!  Burgers have a hint of salt and pepper flavor.  This location is very quaint. They only have outdoor seating  Friendly staff.  Street parking as well as parking lot in the back.",
  "Great staff always helps and always nice. Always clean and huge store size. Stays stocked with everything you need. The staff always helps make my custom breakfast bagel",
  "Took my vehicle here for some work a few years ago for a manufacturer recall. Problem went away and then started hearing another noise which I thought was related, but turned out was a completely different issue. Kevin and his mechanic lifted my car right up and fixed the issue FREE OF CHARGE even though I told them I'd pay. Outstanding individuals for doing that. Highly recommend!",
  "After my ROTD  yesterday of a different Sweet CeCe's location, I realized that I had never reviewed my local source!  Anyway, I love the product.  Love love love.  And I usually like their selection of toppings - good mix between healthy and not-so-healthy.  Sometimes the girls working there aren't really paying attention or are nowhere to be found.  Sometimes you have to remind them of their deals (like $5 Friday).  But I can't give it less than 4 stars because I just love it so much.",
  "What a great addition to the Funk Zone!  Grab a bite, grab some tastings, life is good. Right next door to the Santa Barbara Wine Collective, in fact it actually shares the same tables.  We had a fabulous savory croissant.",
  "Nice relaxing place to get a massage! Same day appointments are easy to come by! I have never been disappointed with any therapist I have had at the Center!",
  "We checked in around 2:30 pm.  Check-in was quick and easy with complimentary valet parking (always appreciated).  The Peppermill is huge and reminded us of the Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.  They have around eight restaurants on site offering almost any type of food you could want.  The casino area is huge, rivaling almost anything you could find in Las Vegas.  One thing we noticed is that many of the slot machines were noted as being penny machines, but when you actually started to play them you realized they had minimum bets of anywhere from 30 cents to $5.  Talk about false advertising!  We were in the Tuscany Tower on the 12th floor.  Our room had a nice view of the huge pool area.  Our room was large and featured free WiFi (likewise always appreciated), a huge bathroom area with large shower (with two shower heads), TV, a large jetted bathtub and a phone next to the commode.  There were dual sinks and lots of counter space.  Plenty of towels were supplied.  The roomy main area had a king bed with night stands, closet, TV, mini fridge, dresser with two drawers, a safe, table for computer or writing, complimentary bottles of water, and three nicely upholstered chairs and table.  The thermostat did a good job controlling the temperature and keeping it comfortable.  Staff were all courteous and helpful.  A very nice place and we enjoyed our stay.",
  "My boyfriend and I tried this deli for the first time today. I had a turkey, avocado & bacon panini and he ha a buffalo chicken wrap. We will definitely be returning. The wait for food wasn't too long, which is always appreciated during lunch hour. There was SO much to choose from. They have salads, soup, macaroni, sandwiches and hot food. I love a deli that has many options to choose from!",
  "Amazing biscuits and (fill in the blank). Great cocktails too. Highly recommended. A bit busy though.",
  "Food was good- atmosphere/decor is like a fishing lodge- menu is someplace between outback & bonefish. Went on a Groupon & all 3 of our meals & calamari appetizer that we ordered were cooked perfectly- we will def be back.",
  "Straight to the point, it's cheap, it tastes and feels cheap  The good: price, location, dessert (edible food items are: baked chicken, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, Salad bar lol, meat and cheese bar, ravioli, pizza) also our waitress was bomb af  The meh: behind counter meat slicing station, shrimp (not even deveined), Mexican station  The bad: breakfast -worst eggs ever, actually worst, eggs. Le Benedict can't even cut through ham or English muffin (tried on all 3 occasions), steak, shrimp again, hell breaded items can't even, don't even. Decor it's the 1970 nightmare you can imagine  Tried 3 times and failed",
  "The only reason I didn't give this restaurant a 5 star rating, is because of one single pretentious waiter. As a 4 night guest at Hotel Palomar, the location of the restaurant is an obvious plus. The first night of my stay, I met a coworker in the restaurant for a cocktail. When we arrived, the host staff were busy and not available, so we just walked in. The restaurant was not too busy, so we just looked at a small table next to the bar and proceeded to take a seat. A waiter came by and I quickly asked if we could have a seat, before sitting down and told him we'd only be having cocktails. He stumbled on his reply, and in an irritated/in-convinced tone, told me \"I guess it would be fine\" and basically just kept walking mid sentence. My guest and I brushed it off, and started having a conversation while looking at the drink menu. To make a long story short, he was distant and we both got the \"couldn't be bothered\" vibe from him. When it came to the bill, we asked if it could be split due to company transaction policies, and you would have thought asked him for some inconceivable task. We basically spent the rest of our night and elevator ride to our room in shock of the rudeness we had just experienced.   Although that situation left a bad taste in our mouth, and the night before we decided to avoid the restaurant, we decided to grab another cocktail and give this place one more try. After looking around and ensuring \"last nights waiter\" wasn't on shift, we walked over to the bar and started looking over the menu. Instantly, the bartender greeted us with pleasant small talk and made us feel 100% welcome. He asked about our day, recommended cocktails and was a completely genuine person. This guy (I think his name was Ben) is an absolute star! He gave us lessons on Whiskey, described how to make classic cocktails, and was 100% invested in our experience. This is exactly what a bartender at a 4/5 star establishment should be - actually he exceeds that. He was kind, funny, friendly and completely redeemed this restaurant/bar from our terrible experience the night before.  I also ordered room service last night from this restaurant, and it was amazing. The bacon wrapped dates and chocolate cake are to die for! Great restaurant and amazing bartender(s). Too bad one bad egg could have spoiled this experience.",
  "Stopped by after a Sunday morning walk in the park - great food, coffee customer service - love the vibe in here",
  "In a word... \"OVERRATED!\".  The food took forever to come out.  The burger was WAY overcooked (Especially when I ordered it Medium Rare) and the Seafood Jumbalaya was Decent.  Not worth the price.  There are better places to eat in the french quarter.  It was not horrible, but for everything that we had heard about this place, I would have expected much better.",
  "Comfortable bed, good breakfast, fast internet, great location, and low price. Overall I was really impressed with this place. However, if you stay on the top floors you may be waiting up to 15 minutes for an elevator in the morning.",
  "NEVER AGAIN. This is a so called restaurant that does nothing that a restaurant should other than prepare food, because the rest is done by the patron. Want water? Get up and go across the yard to get it. Want a drink, walk up a flight of stairs and pay cash. Want to sit in a dirty yard in dirty lawn chairs, enjoy yourself. The wait staff is mildy helpful in that they bring you your food after you go to the window and pay cash for it...kind of like New Orleans Hamburger and Seafood, but dirty and with live music (which is nice). It's a one in a lifetime experience for me...just once.",
  "If you want to pay for everything a la carte this is the place for you.   Food wasn't terrible not impressive. They brought a basket of chips and some tomato sauce which I asked politely for something spicier and some pico de gallo.  She brought them happily to me and the salsa was much better.  When asked what we would like to drink I asked for a coke and she brought out a bottle which I stated I wanted the fountain drink.  She said \"oh that's only Pepsi\".  Never mentioned that they only had bottle drinks for coke.   We ordered our food which was reasonably priced, asked for sour cream and also to put cheese on the taco.  She let us know cheese was extra.   It was $2.50 extra for another basket of chips.   When I received the bill we paid more for the condiments then the actual food.  Side of sour cream 2.00, pico de gallo 2.50, salsa 2.00, chips 2.50, cheese 1.00 and the bottled coke that we didn't want 5.00.   Just a suggestion...when you order anything make sure to ask if there is an extra charge.",
  "The cafe was extremely cute. We came at 8am and they even had a jazz band playing at that time. I got the breakfast sandwich and it was delicious. I loved how they rolled the egg and put the bacon pieces inside. Great price for a filling breakfast!",
  "On a scale of one to things that are awesome, this place is the bomb.   I was drawn in by the promise of the duckfat frenchfries. Took the boy for his birthday and put our name in, had a drink around the corner while we waited and were given seats at the bar after about 45 minutes.   We were waited on by Keith, the bartender, who was congenial, knowledgeable about his whiskeys and an all-around cool guy. We started with 3 cape may salts (two for me, one for the boy) and tater tots, both of which made me happy.  For dinner, I got Kentucky Fried Quail (stellar, though the succotash was not as exciting as I wanted it to be) and the boy got the 24$ Fois Gras burger, which was incredible. Worth every penny. The duckfat fries were pretty yummy, but not even the best part of the meal. I could've done without the cheese sauce, but as it was on the side I wasn't deterred.  I look forward to coming back here, with everyone I know.",
  "We started with the artichoke dip, big mistake. It was cold and the chips were stale. Mentioned to our waitress, but nothing came of it.  We ordered a large pizza, thin crust which after adding toppings it was a bit pricey for pizza.  Pizza was ok, not great. Except for not being our advocate our server was good.  I have been here before for Cardinals game, it was better then. Will try another venue next time.",
  "It was my fiance's birthday and he decided he wanted a good, laid back Thai restaurant for dinner. Yelp steered us in the Jasmine Rice direction, and it was definitely a good decision. We wanted the summer rolls, which were on the menu, but apparently will not be available until summer, so we settled on the pan-fried dumplings. The flavor was good, but I don't think we'd order them again. We got the green curry fried rice with duck and chicken pad thai. Both of those dishes were great, but the duck stole the show. That was some the of tastiest duck I've ever had. The pad thai was a bit sweet for us, so I think we'd try a different noodle dish when we return. But it was still very good, especially with some chili sauce mixed in. Our service was good, but other people had issues. One table was rushing to get to a show at the Kimmel Center and waited quite a while for their meal (and were going to be late). Another person who got take-out was missing one of their items (but the owner realized it and called him and walked the dish to his house, which was very nice). Overall, good quality Thai! We would definitely go back.",
  "I absolutely love Courtney! She is hands down the best hairstylist I have ever had. The reason I think she is so great is that she knows what will look best on me and over the past year has understood my limits for styles. I always go into the salon and tell her to cut my hair how she thinks will look best, and I always leave blown away at what she does. You know you have a great stylist when you don't have to specify what you want done, but instead they see what needs to be done. Great stylist, great personality and very knowledgeable. I would highly recommend her to anyone who wants to look their best.",
  "I've been to this location many times when I lived in the area and although it is a chain and not exactly sexy, it does the job on many occasions.   If you need an oil change, this place is ok, if you need a state inspection this place does it.   The key is getting there when they are not busy or else you will wait.     Again, nothing fancy here a pep boys is a pep boys but all in all decent stuff.",
  "Replaced 2 old 70s lennox with 2 new ones.  They did a great job and have been runnong for 3 years now.",
  "I love the Brewpub for their variety of dishes.  Nachos, pizza and sandwiches.  Variety of beers to choose from crafted right on sight.    Every time we go, the service is slow.  I think it's just the pace of the restaurant.  It's never a quick beer and a bite of food.  Instead, enjoy the patio and friends, savor that time.    Kid and dog friendly environment.  Also great for your vegetarian and vegan friends.    My go to is a half order of the nachos or fish & chips.    Tried their Pumpkin Seasonal Beer and it's on par with some of my favorite pumpkins.",
  "Farmhouse, rustic, chic.Helpful staff with great ideas to decorate your home. Prices reasonable. Store has items from Joanna Gaines ( Fixer Upper) and much more. Finally a good home store in SB with reasonable prices.",
  "My brother came to visit and we wanted to pick up a six pack of good beers for a night in. Ended up staying and having a few while playing their Nintendo 64 (Super Smash Brothers, which the owner said was donated by fellow patrons). It's a great place with good food and genuinely nice people. Should be a staple in the Northeast.",
  "My go to menu is coconut soup and pad thai with protein. I tried same menu here.  Actually really like their coconut soup. They used enough amount of coconut milk that soup was really creamy and wasn't over powering with herb. I am so used to Americanized thai cuisine that I prefer less herb on my dish except cilantro. Pat thai was great too. Liked the amount of peanut they used, noodle was chewy and perfect and not too sweet. They gave me generous amount of chicken and white meat wasn't dry so I was very happy with my meal.",
  "Excellent service! Great diner food and breakfast is served all day. Came here for lunch- they were busy but very friendly and hospitable. Easy to get to off the 295.",
  "My go-to spot on a Saturday night! I was real bummed that lucys closed, but was pleasantly surprised by this bar just across the street! Their food is better than expected. I always get wings and fries. (be careful of the wtf sauce though) Sometimes it takes a real long time to get the bartenders attention, but the place is usually packed. And if you're lucky the always sunny crew will pop in!",
  "We were a bit weary about trying the Shellfish Company on the Wharf as more often than not, many places like these (see Cannery Row, Monterey) feast on a captive audience and provide sub-standard fare at high prices.  However, emboldened by the perennial good reviews on Yelp, we suppressed our initial observations and went ahead with the trying it out. The place is small, so definitely plan ahead. You will have to wait, so either you know, just do so, or perhaps try to visit outside of peak hours. Luckily, our wait was only about 20 minutes as the dinner rush was just leveling off.  The special was the local rock crab - $25 for 3 lbs of California Rock Crab, salad, and your choice of soup/chowder. After taking a look at a few trays of rock crab being served out, the wife and I both opted for it, as it looked awesome.    The salad/chowder combo was great as you actually received hearty portions of each, so it was a good start. As much as I liked the chowder however, the Shrimp Bisque the wife ordered was amazing, so I would recommend that going forward.   But enough of prattling on about side dishes: the rock crab tasted just as glorious as it looked. Juicy, buttery chunks of white crab meat await you, just a few cracks away. While the rock crab shells are pretty thick, once cracked, they splinter and separate easily, a good sign they are cooked to perfection. The rock crabs provided a great amount of meat for what I felt to be the least amount of work you're going to do for crab, King or otherwise.   We were thoroughly satisfied with our meal and along with the special being an overall great value, devouring the Rock Crab at SBSC turned out to be one of the favorite meals on the trip. I think ordering crab here is a safe proposition indeed.",
  "I LOVE Weaver's Way and really disagree with some of the content in previous reviews. WW is not necessarily meant for convenience shopping. I am a single woman and I find that I have no trouble shopping at the co-op, during peak times or otherwise. I actually find the co-op to be a great place to shop if you live alone because I can get smaller quantities of items than if I shop at the corporate stores like Acme. I also enjoy the work hours - I've worked throughout the store, but most recently, I have been getting in my hours by participating in the membership committee. I wouldn't say that the community is necessarily made up of \"tree huggers\" and \"earth children\", though. The community is made up of a variety of similarly-minded folks from different backgrounds. I enjoy having a place to go to where I can obtain locally grown produce, a place that offers more natural, wholesome, and preservative-free foods than chain stores with prices way below that of Whole Foods. I enjoy interacting with other members and contributing to my local and global community. I don't find the membership fee or the work hours to be prohibitive being a single person vs. a family. I don't think that membership in a co-op is for everyone and, if you aren't single, it's definitely not a solo decision. If you're keen on being committed to the Weaver Way values, you couldn't find a better place to shop. If not, stick to the chain stores or just pay the 10% visitors' fee to pop in once in a while.",
  "Honestly the food doesn't knock my socks off but other people seem to love this place. I go because my husband likes it as for me I'd rather go to a different BBQ spot. I guess it also depends on what you order.",
  "The TV shows are $4.99 and they have commercials! What a cheesy way to make money and a sign of a less than classy hotel, particularly when you pay more than $150 a night.  And there is NO complimentary breakfast, just an overpriced buffet, something even the cheapest hotels in California provide.",
  "I stopped here because it was by the hotel I was staying in. The guys working at the shop were super nice and friendly. I really like the buy one get one deal they do. I also ordered some hot wings and they were pretty good. They had a ton of sauce on them which is awesome. Next time I come back to town I will be sure to stop here for some more pizza!",
  "I've only had the cannolis here but they are awesome! They're freshly filled when ordered and the filling is phenomenal. Not too sweet, it's perfect. If you like cannoli, if you don't think you like cannoli, you should definitely get one from Termini Bros.",
  "Traveling through in our RV, stopped over in Granite City. Found this little gem of a cafe. Upon entering, the staff was very sweet and friendly. This is like home cooking. We ate here twice and all our food choices were fresh, delicious and like we would fix at home. Yum.",
  "After 3 weeks of working in the area I finally found a place off of Magazine that is not overrated. Friendly staff! Y'all know I love Phò so it's pretty damn good!",
  "Our family returned for breakfast again this weekend and the food and service was again impeccable ... Highly recommend",
  "The kayaking tour at the Santa Cruz Island was great.  My husband and I had a wonderful time.  Jen, our tour guide, was helpful and informative.  We had a lot of fun exploring the caves.  We didn't expect much but this tour definitely exceeded our expectation.",
  "Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a delicious meal at a reasonable price. The shrimp and goat cheese crepes are a must have!",
  "After living in the STL area for way over 10 years now, I am both ashamed and remorseful to admit that I ate here for the FIRST time just a few weeks ago. I am ashamed because it's a St. Louis tradition and remorseful because I missed out on it for so..many...years!   This place is amazing. What is not to love! It's a factory where you can get a tour (Friday-Sunday, noon-5pm on the hour), there's a shop, bar, and dining area. They also host many event with live music on the weekends. It's fun to just kind of wander and look around - don't worry, you'll get a chance because there will likely be a wait before you dine. The beer is, of course, amazing. The Hefeweizen is my personal favorite and a great start for anyone who is not a huge beer drinker (like myself). Additionally, the food is homegrown and damn good. I had the pizza (recommendation from my server) and it was really spectacular, though I'm admittedly a pizza connoisseur so I enjoy a good pizza pie more than most probably ;P My date had a bison burger which was also really good.   More fun info: the service is great! I think they tend to hire more funky and alternative people (like tattoo parlor staff) which I support. The quality is what makes this place stand out along with the emphasis on local food and brewery.   It is a little on the pricier side but for all the experience you get and the quality, it is worth it. I will go again and again and you probably should, too!",
  "If I could give it a zero, I would. I order a plain hamburger, and realized they put  bacon in it (which I am allergic to and unable to eat) after two bites. When I went back to the drive-through window to complain (didn't realize the actual restaurant was open--it was almost 2 after all...), the guy took back the burger, said nothing, and disappeared. After 2 minutes of awkwardly making conversation with the next people in line in their car, he came back and rudely told me I had to go inside to get my food. Which I did. And still did not get an apology.  I refuse to go back there after that ordeal, which is a shame, because it's nice to have a variety of places to go to after DT. Guess Freebirds it is!",
  "First time here and they did a great job, very satisfied with the car wash  and the service I received. Thank you",
  "I just started going to Sushi Nara this month (they opened just a short time ago).  I love this place; it is clean, the staff are friendly and acommodating, and the service is fast.  The sushi is always delicious ((I've been here 3 times) and the prices are reasonable. In fact, this week my husband stopped in for take out, bought 4 sushi rolls and the total was $24.  That is amazing.    I love the freshness of the food and there's a huge selection to choose from.  Everyone on the eastside, check this place out!",
  "Awesome little shop.  The owner really knows his stuff and you can tell he loves his work.  They have tires and other parts you won't find anywhere else.",
  "Been here so many times before and all I can say is the food is really good. A hidden gem in Florissant, it has the best Panang curry around. Haven't been to their sister restaurant yet, but I can't seem to want to move on when I am always so satisfied with their fare here.",
  "My food only merited maybe two stars but I will give an extra star because I like the menu (and will try more of it) and their design and concept.  Sadly though, my tomato-basil soup tasted kind of like a weak marinara and my tuna melt type sandwich had a very sharp, off-putting flavor.  It was citrusy, for sure, and I love lemon in a tuna melt but perhaps this was lemon zest or something just way too overpowering?  I think next time I will focus on the dishes with cured Italian meats, mortadella and prosciutto.  And also the baked goods, those sounded pretty good, especially the Nutella bruschetta!",
  "We visited once and were very disappointed in my veggie pizza and my husband's sub sandwich.  The tomato sauce was not tasty, and they did not use enough cheese on my pizza.  The dough looked and tasted like it was prepared by a machine.  Perhaps they have improved, but we are not in any rush to try a second time.",
  "A couple friends and I stopped by for some late night milkshakes and found ourselves at More Than Just Ice Cream. Well, we just got ice cream...not fully taking advantage of what the name implies, but maybe next time.  3 milkshakes: 1 coffee, 1 chocolate, and 1 black&white malt.   All were pretty good. Definitely satisfied the ice cream craving. I thought my coffee milkshake could have been thicker, same goes for the chocolate. The black&white was plenty thick and was probably the best of the three. Unfortunately, I did not order that one so I settled for my not so creamy coffee.  I did sample some ice cream flavors before setting on a milkshake. I tried the pumpkin pie which was AMAZING. I don't know why I didn't just get this. Maybe a milkshake isn't the way to go here.",
  "My husband and I took my mother here for her 100th birthday! We can't say enough about the treatment we received: from a great table and view, to delicious \"compliments of the chef\" extra dishes, to a beautifully decorated cake plate, to the warm and attentive servers. It was much more than we expected, even for this very special occasion. For us, it was a wonderfully memorable experience.",
  "Man. This place is nice. The bartender was awesome. Try the burger. It's fresh with all local ingredients. The plates of food I saw come out looked amazing as well.   The beer is cold. The drinks are mixed perfectly.  This is not a chain restaurant but a dedicated local place with good employees.",
  "I visited this restaurant 4 times during my 5 days stay. Crazy, right? Here are a list of reasons/pros:  - We were staying a nearby hotel. - The restaurant opens 11 - 10:30 pretty much every day including new year's day so it fits into our schedule. - If you are a party of two, chances are you get seated right away. - $9 per dozen of oysters which is a really great deal by any standard! - They have a seafood shop next door that sells boiled and fresh seafood to- go. - Our server (same) is very friendly and recognized us every single time.  Now I want to talk about the reasons why I only give it 3 stars.  - We tried a bunch of stuff which are all pretty mediocre. Raw oysters are not cleaned well. So if your schedule is flexible, go to Superior Seafood during their happy hours for their 50 cents/oyster - better quality and cheaper. Turtle soup has a strange taste so I definitely prefer Felix's. A portion of my boiled shrimps are always mushy somhow, maybe boiled for too long?... - The ambient is inviting but not comfortable so we basically just finished our food and go.  - Clean the bathroom!!  Will probably visit again if we stay in the area next time or simply just pick up some seafood quickly.",
  "Skip this train wreck if you are looking for dinner.  Our server was clueless...like we seriously thought she was lost in the restaurant.  Had to ask for setups, water refills, etc.  Ordered chicken parmesan and got eggplant parmesan instead with a fish bone in it.  The drinks were good.",
  "Meh is all I can say for TDS. The restaurant itself is just cold.... not literally, but figuratively. There was no decor, no menu boards, stainless steel prep tables as dining tables, no soda machines, staff EVERYWHERE with no identification (shirts, nametags, etc). The food is reasonably priced and most of it was quite good, but what really irked my party was the fact that they charge for extra salsa!!! We ordered a salsa trio (which included 3 samples of the various salsas, in 2oz glass prep bowls), and when my brother asked for more salsa for his tacos (mind you, we ordered one of ever taco, three burritos and guacamole), he was told he'd have to buy the trio again! Really!!??? We spent over $40 on food, drinks and apps, too. Even though the food was decent, I wouldn't return as the atmosphere is just blah and you can't get extra salsa for your damn tacos!",
  "I'm so incredibly happy with our pictures! Angela Clifton Photography have worked with us 3 times and we have been happy with every single picture that was taken! Not only are the photos fabulous, but we had such a fun experience. The price is extremely reasonable and the pictures will be a keepsake we will cherish forever!",
  "Enjoyed my fish out at a sidewalk table.  A bit pricey but food was good.  Go to Side street in French quarter if u want quieter dining outside.",
  "The court house is very old and the art is great. The spiral staircase is funny. One can get view of entire city from 5th level. The tower clock room is really surprising with all mechanical gears inside!! You need a prior appointment to get into clock room. Worth spending 2 to 3 hours of time here.",
  "I had the pleasure to meet with Ann today and not only was she extremely helpful and so positive, she went above and beyond to make my 1st experience here amazing and made it a absolute regular customer from this day forward. Thanks girlie!!",
  "This is the first time I tried this place and  I was surprisingly surprised. I had a combination dinner pad Thai and coconut soup. The soup was very tasty as I never had coconut soup before. The pad Thai was exactly what I was expecting and it did not disappoint. The restaurant had great Thai decor and music. The staff and service was top notch. For a town with not much selection for food, this was a great change of pace. This may become my go to place in Carp.",
  "This place was so chill and relaxing. When I come back it'll definitely be in my list if stops. Not to mention the artist performing was fun and eclectic  (I mean really, a country version of \"Let It Go\", what's not to love?)",
  "Id you haven't been to the Smoothie King center since it was know as the New Orleans Arena, you are in for a nice surprise. The arena has had a face lift and, while the seats are the same,  everything else has been refreshed.     Most importantly,  the food options are far more varied and appeal to many tastes.  The quality of the food is very good and significantly improved from a few years back. The drink options are much improved as well and include full service bars, spiked lemonade,  bottled and draft beer and of course, smoothies.  There is even a spot for sweets. You can get funnel cake, cotton candy, and all kinds of delicious things I was too full to take in.    The venue finally feels a bit swanky and top notch.  We are moving on up!",
  "Don't know what it is but If my tummy's feeling icky, I can count on Chipotle's stake to fix me up. I just have to remember not to go during full on lunch time. I usually go between 2 & 4 when it's peaceful and calm. Busy or not the service is always friendly and fast!",
  "I must admit, I wasn't expecting much. This place totally blew us away. This has to be one of the best Indian restaurants in the Tampa Bay. The ambience is wonderful including white table linens. The best part was the food, OMG. The chicken 65 was to die for, and the hot sour soup was rich and flavorful. The waitress (Angel) was friendly,  attentive and very pleasant. They opened just a week ago. I'm sure this will soon be the place foodies seek out for real Indian food.",
  "Had to wait until my third trip to NOLA to actually get in the door.  First two times I tried waiting in line, this time around we got smart and bought reserved seats so we could be on the benches. Well worth the extra $20 to not hassle with waiting in line for an hour. It goes toward the preservation of Jazz so it's a good cause...just splurge.  The show was fantastic.  True musicians and great personalities to boot. I can only imagine that this is what concerts were like 50 years ago. The band members were dapper, engaging and insanely talented.  It's in a tiny hole in the wall space that only holds maybe 200 people? So it's very intimate and nice to see the smiles on the faces of the musicians as they share their craft with you. This is a must do while in NOLA!",
  "A GREAT EXPERIENCE!!!!!!!!!  I was a completely new customer.  I did not have an appointment because my other plans got rained out and my dealership was too busy to take me.  I needed a PA State & Emissions  inspection which I dread because they can be a total ripoff at some places when they add things on and I just wanted to get it over with.  I saw that this place had much better reviews on Yelp than many other shops in the area.  Keystone Discount Tire took my 2008 Pontiac Torrent in for inspection while I waited and had some free coffee.  I only had to get up once to look at some irregular outer front tire wear on my car when it was on the rack during inspection.  I always appreciate it when the technician lets me look at the problem.   It was nothing major.  Easily correctable with an alignment sometime in the future.  Bill was very friendly, knowledgable, and straightforward with his overall analysis of my car.  My car was fully inspected and stickered in less than an hour without my bill being jacked up with add-ons.   I recommend getting on their mailing list for their coupons!!!!!!!!!!",
  "Wow! I never thought my sons phone could be repaired after he dropped it but it is and it took less than a half an hour! Very professional and excellent service! I'm thrilled!",
  "Service and management terrible... After messing up all 4 of our orders the waiter got mad and started cursing... The manager offered our drinks to be free.. What a mess. The food was cold and nasty didn't even eat half of it and waited over an hour... I will never dine in any cracker barrel again after this experience...",
  "I have been to a number of dog friendly hotels...just not in the city and did not know what to expect. Usually they are motel like.  This one was in the heart of the city.  I walked tentatively into the hotel lobby as i have a labrador/golden mix who is not easy to hide.  We got to the front desk to register and i was still feeling uneasy although my  bf had assured me it was a dog friendly hotel. Reception was so nice immediately putting us at ease. As we checked in an attendant asked if Bentley could have treats which she fullly enjoyed. The Reception person also asked if we would like a welcome kit for Bentley. Holy moly. Of course. Dog dishes, a mat, treats, etc. I was blown away.    Plus the guests at the hotel all stopped to compliment and pet \"queen Bentley\". Our room was on the top floor. Awesome!  Even when i went to walk her the car attendants greeted her by name. We were so impressed with the service we decided to come back an extra night.   Thank you Loews. I didnt realize a hotel could be so dog friendly especially to a big dog.",
  "Sometimes this food is very very good.  Unfortunately it's not consistent.   Ordered something I've been getting for years and every other time it tastes incredible. It's like they have different people in the kitchen and you don't know who you will get. So 50 % of the time it's excellent.  UGH.",
  "Been to this location twice and will never go back again!!!!  First time was mediocre, the second time was so very disappointing it beggars belief. I ordered some ribs and had to send them back because one half was warm and the other half was refrigerator cold. They came back and one side was really hot and the other side was still cold, third time it was edible. The manager came over the third time to apologize, never once offered to comp anything. I'm not the kind of guy to cause a fuss to get something comped, but to send something back three times to get it cooked properly and only get an insincere apology really pisses me off, enough for me to write this review.",
  "After trying a few ramen places with crazy variety in their selections and stellar broth, I was not too excited about the ramen I got at Cheu.  Maybe it's a matter of taste, but personally, I was not a fan of their thick noodles, and extremely salty broth.    The service was great, and they had a nice selection of beers!  The friend I went with loved it, and has been many times.  Honestly, I'm just sorry I wasn't a bigger fan.  But I hope others try it for themselves.  I might just be an oddball out on this one.",
  "Federal Doughnuts is a new concession at the ballpark -- who doesn't love some doughnuts and fried chicken?    Also, there is now a concession stand near 136 that is gluten-free dedicated.  They offer pizza, cheesesteaks and even brownies and cookies.",
  "Looks like there is a second Red Kings restaurant in Chinatown and it did not disappoint! Since this place just opened yesterday, I'm not exactly sure if it's replacing the other Red Kings down the street, or if it is just a second helping of spicy, Szechuan food.  We ordered takeout and picked up the Dan Dan Noodles and a shredded Pork in Garlic sauce dish. The spice level in both dishes was perfect.  Extremely mouth-burning, but with delicious flavors that were sweet, earthy, and fresh. The portions were very generous and will make for great leftovers for us. I can't wait to try some of the other dishes and come back here for a sit-down dinner. They also have karaoke rooms upstairs, plus they are BYOB.",
  "This is one of the busiest Chick fil A's I've seen but they always manage to be quick and have exceptional service! I seriously don't know how they can be so quick and great all the time! One of my favorite places!",
  "Best place for salads! I go there every time I'm in town for lunch. It's fast and veggies are always fresh.",
  "My parents and I took the Oak Alley and Laura Plantation tour on September 26th, 2015.  I forgot the name of our driver-he was very informative on our drive to the plantations.  The schedule is perfect!  We were dropped off where we had time before and after the tour for free time to walk around the properties.  They are very flexible with drop off locations on the return drive.  We got off near Jackson Square and got to enjoy the rest of the afternoon in the French Quarter.",
  "We have been here twice for brunch and have enjoyed it immensely. Everything we have tried has been delicious, particularly the grits with scallions and sour cream. But the room is always freezing so be sure to bring a sweater!",
  "Love this place...best hot dogs and chili dogs around...i go here as many times as i can..yum",
  "Sweet spot in the Waterline. Came for some live music with friends on Saturday. Very cool. Best local beer in town by far. Seems like the concept is a few notches up from Fig Mountain. Definitely prefer Topa. Even cooler is that you can order incredible food from the Nook Restaurant, and walk two feet into Lama Dog which is part of the Waterline. I love it!!",
  "Great customer service! We were a little out of their pick up area but they were very accommodating and came and got our group of 7. When we got there we realized we were billed for 8 instead of 7. I called and he refunded my money for the extra ticket in minutes!  The tour itself was SO much fun! We were laughing and smiling and our tour guide was funny! We saw lots of alligators! From babies swimming in the water to full grown ones! We saw turtles and birds too! Our tour guide had a baby alligator we could hold that he's raising until it's a little bigger since it was a late hatch that would have died because of when it was born. The ride back was fun too because we went fast and the guide did some \"tricks\" with the boat! I highly recommend this tour!!!",
  "Westfall replaced our roof in April. We could not be more pleased with the entire process. Quality roof, excellent communication and excellent follow up. Very happy we chose this company to replace our roof.",
  "Good food, reasonably priced, and nice staff. Not ideal for eating in, but since they are going for a fast food approach to vegan food, that makes a lot of sense. I know the buffalo bella is the dish that they push the hardest, but for my money the Cheesesteak is the way to go. And pro-tip: Get the sweet potato fries.",
  "The ramen is okay, nothing spectacular. Service is okay. Good place for a quick stop but wouldn't go if there were other choices. Been here twice, will continue to go.",
  "A menu that satisfies everyone's cravings! Clean, trendy, and delicious! I definitely recommend going early (before 9 am) as the wait tends to get longer after 9 am! But honestly, it is soooo worth the wait. You will leave there feeling so incredible satisfied!",
  "Had the brisket sandwich with two sides and a drink for 9.99 - Great barbecue at an affordable price. Wonderful side such as potato casserole cream spinach baked beans green beans",
  "The food and service was amazing! I only wish they had any vegetarian/vegan options. Can't wait to come back!",
  "Great food. Terrible customer service. I've been three times and I've had two different older waitresses. Not pleasant to deal with whatsoever. The owner on the other hand is lovely.",
  "I first heard about this place on the plane ride over from a Franklin local.  He recommended that we brave the line and try one of Nashvilles best breakfast spots.  HE WAS RIGHT.  Holly cow this place kicked butt and we didn't even have to wait in line!! We were lucky to miss the rush said our waitress.   I had this super savory corn pancake with bacon, salsa, and sour cream. So good. This place will always be a stop when I get back to the south~~~",
  "OMG!!! I can't believe this kind of service exists!  My husband called to make an appointment for full detailing for next Sat with Michael, he called again to confirm on Fri before we head there since it's a distance from our home.  Michael said he didn't know we wanted to do full detailing thou we specifically mentioned that.  He advised us to come the following sat instead.  We agreed and we reached there at 8am on the following week.  Guess what?  Nobody is at the workshop, it's closed!  We called him and he said he is busy and will call back.. We waited for half an hour in our car and there is still no call from him.  We headed for our breakfast and came back again at 9:30am hoping to give him another chance.  Here comes Alex, his partner opening the shop at 9:30am!  1.5 hours away from our appt time and still no sight of Michael.  Alex tried calling Michael and couldn't get hold of him.  We gave up!!! What a horrendous experience!",
  "I had numerous things happen during my move and required additional services from this office. The guys in this office are top notch and are very trustworthy. I'd say more about how they took great care of me, but they may have gone above and beyond what they should have and afraid to say too much. I would recommend this office to my mother!",
  "We stayed at The Saint last year for a girl's trip. The lobby is lovely, they have a cool bar and restaurant that you can't help but to \"ohh and ahh\" over when you walk in.  All the things I'm accustomed too when I stay at a hotel anywhere...ambiance, a little sexy but not overkill! Everyone is so friendly, etc.  I'm thinking \"oh shhhh this is going to be a great weekend!\"  I checked in a few hours before my girl arrived because I had a ton of work i needed to do. So I set up my laptop ordered some room service and worked for about 4 hours straight. Left out to buy a bottle and get a mani/pedi.  My girl arrives...its about to be some trouble in NOLA... the two of us and no supervision...we pop out for dinner, come back in giggling as usual and we see it...a HUGH flying roach.  I'm freaked out.  I literally walk right out of the room down to the front desk.  I CANNOT!!!! They tell me they're sending a maintenance worker to handle it.  NOT GOOD ENOUGH! If there's one that's bold enough to show itself, he has other cohorts that prefer to live behind the scenes. They give us another room but tell me they can't do more until 8am.  No the room the move us too also has small spiders and other dead small bugs in the corners of the window. The TV doesn't work and one of the lamps doesn't have bulbs in it! COME ON!  At this point its about 3am and I know I'm not staying here past 8:15am. I dont want to sit my purse let alone my luggage in this hotel! I go online to my normal go to hotel, The W and book us there for the rest of the trip! 8am comes and goes no manager comes to our room. I go down and demand to see someone immediately.  This younger gentlemen comes out and apologizes.  I thank him for his apology and politely request ALL of my money back immediately.   He obliged and asked if  I would consider coming back after changes have been made! Bless his heart. NO dear!",
  "Say you decide that you need a new door...and you only have $35.  Where do you go?  the Green Project.   Or you have a bunch of left over building supplies, random bits of lumber, some roofing materials, maybe even some paint?  Where can you bring it so it doesn't end up in a landfill?  Again, the Green Project.",
  "Worst place I've ever visited. The bouncer was rude and he didn't have to be. This place thinks just cause your on broadway you can treat people bad and over charge.   I'm not a tourist I live here and will never visit or recommend",
  "Stopped in for the lunch menu with my girlfriend, place was extremely clean, food was ON POINT!  And AFFORDABLE Can't wait to go back!!",
  "So disappointing on so many levels. Have been coming here for years - and the quality of food has fallen off a cliff. Strike one - we shared an artichoke to start - and clearly it had been prepared beforehand (eg, cold on the inside - but the flesh was cooked through)  Strike two - my wife had a Greek salad - and it clearly all came from a bag and was extremely overdressed with tasteless dressing.  Strike three - I had grilled yellowtail which was basically execrable - could not even finish it (overcooked and an inferior-frozen piece of fish - unacceptable for SB).   In short - great setting, good service - but with such horrible food - not worth the visit. This place really needs to up the quality of food - or it's going to end up just another lower State dive for the tourists.",
  "Milktooth is the place to go if you want a good breakfast cocktail and a twist on traditional brunch. At first glance of the menu, you may think you've never heard of any of these foods for breakfast, and you may be right. I guarantee no matter what you order, you're going to enjoy it.   Milktooth is one of the most popular brunch places in Indy, which means you will typically have a wait. Trust me, it's worth the usual 30 minute wait (on weekends). To make it go by a little faster, they've got a walk up bar for their coffee drinks and pastries. Snack on one of those to give you a preview of the amazing meal you're about to have.  Their menu changes from time to time but they have a few things that stay one the menu but change ingredients. I love all of their variations on a Dutch pancake, and their raclette grilled cheese is to die for.  If you're making this a boozy breakfast, don't pass up on the michelada. And sit outside if it's warm enough!",
  "The bar and staff are AMAZING. we got a room upgrade for have been being on our honeymoon and the view was gorgeous. But, the room was not any better than a hilton. It had rust in the tub floor, and some weird stains on the tile. But this was only in the bathroom, so i give it 4 stars! Great staff, but too much for valet so we parked a couple streets down. That was the only other con I would say.   Would recommend if you want to be literally in the working downtown area of st. louis. Lots of cool bars and restaurants on a friday night.",
  "I took the beginning class there, and I loved it. It was perfectly paced, and though the moves weren't difficult, they really stretched me in places I didn't know existed! I even broke a small sweat! But I felt great afterwards! The studio is clean, and I like that I can buy some Beyond Organic food items there too.",
  "Not sure why it took until now for us to find this place. We started out going to the chain lobster restaurant but wanted something more authentic. A friend recommended Lobster Haven and I checked it out online. Looked like a type of place we would eat at in Massachusetts when we visit family. We were not disappointed! Service was great, fast and very friendly. Huge selection of all of the favorites. You have to visit this place if you want authentic New England seafood. You can also purchase live lobster and fresh seafood to go and cook it yourself.",
  "Fabulous! Best happy hour, fresh menu, Delish- drinks, if I had the time, I'd come here every day!",
  "Men's clubs is the tits, plain and simple. All the barbers got skills enough to hook it up fresh. Been coming here for 3 years and I've never had any problems. Except for maybe that one time when this dude tried to steal my cut. Tim kept it real though and said \"I can't give you the same cut as Ryan.\" Thanks Tim.",
  "My husband and I come here often. We love the food here, it's always fresh and the service is great. We highly recommend this place to anyone who loves sushi & hibachi.",
  "Oh Chickie's and Pete's, you are the perfect place to watch some sports and indulge.   No doubt this is not the best food I've ever had but, if you can get a seat, grab some beer with mussels red and crab fries, there's no way not to thoroughly enjoy this place during a game or any time you're down by the stadiums.   My favs are the crab fries, mussels red (white is overloaded with garlic that I can't always take it), the spicy pull and peel shrimp, steamers, and if the mood is right the blue crabs (it's a lot of work but tasty). This place also makes getting down and dirty with your food easy. There are sinks all over so you can rinse the mess off your hands once you're done....good touch.  To sum it up, Chickie's and Pete's is a Philadelphia institution and always a good time. I strongly suggest going at least once to enjoy the experience.   Please note: Make sure to remember two things before coming during major sporting events. 1. You'll never get a table and 2. You'll deal with a ton of drunk people. I've absolutely been one of these people before and we can get annoying unless you're in the right frame of mind. :)",
  "Prompt and professional. On a Saturday. Simple mirror fix, but they made it easy for me. I have used them in Charlotte and they were great then, too.",
  "Good choice in Union Station St. Louis.  I had the Ponchartrain (server said it is same as Tilapia, though that was also on the menu, so why two names for the same fish, I have no clue).  The Ponchartrain was quite good with mushrooms and a cream sauce.  We also had the shrimp cocktail and lump crab cake appetizers....both fine, but not wonderful.  Drinks and service were perfectly acceptable.  We dined outside on the patio since the weather was nice - inside looks comfy and a bit less casual.",
  "I stopped in for a drink yesterday and have to say the atmosphere gets an A+ from me.  Such a unique concept for the St. Pete area.  The attention to detail with the remodel was outstanding, it almost feels like you are in a Harry Potter movie or something.  There is background music that is set at a low volume so you can clearly hear your friends or not have to shout for them to hear you - perfect for the old library-esque environment. Working behind the bar were Michael and Peggy - both couldn't have been more friendly and were overall just interesting people to talk to.   I had eaten dinner already before I came so can't speak on the food but will definitely be back to try - the prices for meat/cheese trays are much better than comparable places in the area.  I would definitely recommend checking this place out...",
  "Yes! I love this place! Maple Street Patisserie is the bomb.com! I've never been disappointed. Best blueberry muffin I've ever had in my whole entire life. Delicious breakfast and lunch spot. They also do specialty cakes so swing by during Mardi Gras and grab a king cake. Also the owner, Ziggy, is the man. He's always running around working crazy hours to make all these scrumptious baked goods. Can't beat this place :)",
  "Really good burger. I had the Bourbon Black and Bleu. It was cooked like I wanted and very tasty.   I gave them 3 stars for the wait. We had a big party - 4 adults and 5 kids - and it took over an hour to get our food. Shouldn't have taken that long, regardless of how many people were at our table.",
  "It seems to me that whenever we have out of towner guests, our go to place is consistently Katie's. The variety of food wonderfully prepared is 2nd to none. Reasonably priced and delicious, Katie's never disappoints. Whether you choose the grilled ersters, the shrimp and grits, the Cuban sandwich, pizza, or soup & salad you will be very pleased and have a great meal. Daily specials hi-lite local seasonal offerings that keep things fresh. The service staff are warm and friendly. On Sunday's, you will want to time your arrival before church let's out or you will have a bit of a wait. That said, you can always manage while enjoying bottomless Mimosas!",
  "Came in after attending the Zurich Classic golf tournament. It was a warm and a bit humid so what tastier then a ice cream cone? I lucked out and found a parking space on the street. The interior is quite cute and comfy.  The selection here is crazy huge but after sampling a couple of unusual flavors I went with the scoop of cookie monster ice cream on a cone. The ice cream hit the spot and I enjoyed it BC it wasn't overly sweet.  Creole Creamery was definitely worth checking out!",
  "I LOVE this place!  I have been coming here for a few years now.  Its a little funky, and I would never order say the escargot, for safety reasons, but when it comes to lots of Saki, great rolls, and mountains of rice and Sashimi, this is the way to go.  Young atmosphere, loud dance music, and SAKI!",
  "We absolutely love everything we have tried here. Our favorite thus far has been the Backyard Bowl, although there are several more that we still need to try. My husband and I are always full after we each get a kids size, or split a large. The ingredients are good quality,  filling foods. For the quality of ingredients, the price is very reasonable. It can get pretty busy here, but have patience, it is worth the wait.",
  "It's was okay service was a bit on the interesting side as the person was new. Food presentation was good though they need to either add rice or more potato salad to the gumbo. Sprite was flat but I didn't need it anyways.",
  "This is a pretty good pancake place, but it's a little disorganized in the way it's run when it's really busy. The pancakes are pretty good but super sweet, so you have to be in there. Good price point. Serves breakfast all day so that's definitely a plus, but not anything particularly special that you couldn't get anywhere else.",
  "Great finds and wonderful staff!  LOVE our finds and will definitely be back!!!",
  "We've been coming here since I was a kid. The staff has watched me and now my kids grow up. They're personable and so nice. They're also very prompt with service. Yoli and frank are the absolute best! The food is amazing! I absolutely love their shredded beef burro and cheese crisp. I feel they have true authentic Mexican food.",
  "Dine-in gets 2 stars. Disappointing service & venue falls short.   The food was ok; so if you were to do take out, maybe this place would get 3 stars.   I ordered the lamb kebab, which tasted ok; but it was very plain. No sauces, lettuce or anything - just meat.",
  "The best middle eastern restaurant in this area!! Food is great and consistent!! Makes my tummy happy!!!",
  "I cannot even believe someone gave this place one star. Here's the scoop. They have the BEST cannoli in the city. Termini's are no where NEAR as good, and Isgro's is far too hyped up for the quality. Potito's is my go to for cannoli, i wouldn't even THINK about going anywhere else. I'm there every xmas eve, and will be for the rest of my days. I stood in line for isgros for TWO HOURS this year for a tirimisu, i walked right into potito's and picked up my bambino cannoli stuffed cannoli. it's as good as it sounds, trust me.",
  "Truly, I cannot say enough good things about this tiny, authentic, perfectly delicious eatery!  Growing up in the panhandle of Texas, we had plenty of authentic Mexican food in our home, and I'm always searching for good Mexican restaurants. El Limon is the best I've ever had in the state of Pennsylvania!  Sopes, tostadas, enchiladas, fajitas, burritos, fish tacos....all excellent and sooooo reasonable!  Waitstaff is always pleasant and attentive.  Best two features: homemade tamales and free margaritas!!  Bring the entire family for an amazing Mexican feast!  Ole!",
  "I'm giving this joint 4 stars because they have earned it, but they are definitely 5 star material, if they work out a few kinks. Granted, they just opened, so some of the errors I've experienced (I work in the area, so I've been there several times) will probably get worked out and they are more than willing to make corrections and accommodations when they mess up.   But over all, the food is REALLY good. Unlike my fellow Yelp-ers, I would say that ther pizza is not their strong suit - its kinds greasy and not sure if they use 100% mozzarella - tastes like its cut with something cheaper. However, so far I've had:    The Quaker (Chicken version) - Delicious. They make their chicken steaks with the chunky chicken, which I like much more than the shredded version. They could season the chicken more, but the cheese was melted perfectly and the veggies were fresh.   The fries - crisp and flavorful. I didn't even need ketchup, and I always eat ketchup on my fries  The onion rings - a little greasy, but very tasty and crisp. The onions stayed in the breading and didn't slide out when you bit them (which I hate).   Spanakopita - mine was a little over cooked, but the flavors were really good  Baklava - VERY GOOD!   Signature Salad - The veggies they use are very fresh which will make or break a salad. Their balsamic is great too!  The (turkey) Greek Burger - one of the best turkey burgers I've ever had! The patty was moist and flavorful all on its own, but then they top it with what must be homemade tzatziki. I could eat a bowl of that stuff! My burger had romaine instead of the advertised arugula, but it was very fresh, so I didn't mind as much. I also asked for feta, which I didn't get, but that sauce made me forget all about it.   Overall, this place is great! Provided they don't stray from the high quality standard they are setting, I will keep going back.",
  "Planet fitness gets four stars just because it is open 24 hours. If you are looking at cheapest it's cheapest best bang for your buck . Not much motivation since bodybuilders don't go there much mostly big women . No pun intended . No discrimination I myself used to be big, although I changed that .  Tanning bed and massage chairs and a sculpt machine and everything. Else for 20.00 a month . 9.99 - the massage and stuff and can't bring friends . All the employees are polite and helpful .",
  "Very disappointed. We went to eat  at 2:15 on Saturday and were told the kitchen closed at 2. Their website says: Sat & Sun all day. Their website claims that they are open until 5. I'm always a bit suspect of places that can't manage simple details like their hours on their website. It makes me wonder about the awareness to quality and other \"small\" items.",
  "These guys do good work, on time, and warranty their work.  I would highly recommend them!",
  "Eat here at least 2 times a week. Servers are always friendly and the food is amazing. I never leave disappointed & always leave with a full stomach",
  "A truly delightful find! This is the transformed Carrow's Restaurant on Plumb and Kietzke that was saved by the wrecking ball by its beautiful redwood beams and fascia. The food was fantastic. My wife had the tri-tip salad -- greens on one side of the plate with a balsamic vinagrette balanced by four good-sized slices of medium-rare tri-tip and potato \"croutons\" -- little heavenly bits of crunchy potatoes. I had the tri/tip/chicken combo, selecting the fresh corn salad and potato salad as my two sides. It was so good that we ordered dessert as well (not something I do regularly). The offering was lemon meringue, mudd pie, apple pie, and ice cream. We shared the first -- again delicious, with real, perfectly set and browned meringue. The prices were very reasonable for the quality of food and the experience. We've already recommended to family and friends locally, and expect to return soon. Well done!",
  "Rebecca didn't Doula my birth.  BUT, she was our nanny to our first born daughter.  Over the months of her being in my home, I realized that I looked forward to talking to her before & after work.  I was big & pregnant with Baby #2, and her information & suggestions hit home with this expectant Momma!  She was always easy to talk with, yet honest and extremely truthful!  (A trait I LOVE!!!).  She loves the special role she plays as Doula to laboring woman!!  She finds beauty and strength in that magical time. Bec would be a great addition to your support team!!!",
  "Recently had my car tinted by Orange Tint and Tune and had fantastic service.  They offer a car pick up service if you live within 4 miles of their shop which is extremely convenient.  Carlos was my technician and went over all the tint options with me and even adjusted the grade of the tint after I expressed the look that I was trying to achieve.  That's the kind of customer care that deserves 5 stars.  In addition, the receptionist was very pleasant and the owner Dustin even followed up to see how my service was.",
  "Stayed here three nights on business.  The property is located very close to the airport but you really don't hear it.  The rooms are standard TownePlace Suite rooms with a refrigerator, stove, etc..  The area in which the hotel is located is quiet with a combination of other hotels and office buildings.  It's about a 20 minute drive to the downtown or university area.  About 5-10 minutes from Pima Air Museum.  There are not too many restaurants close by but there are some fast food options and a sandwich place called Baggins that was really good and within walking distance.  The staff of the hotel was really friendly and helpful.  The breakfast is standard continental with a couple of hot options. They also have a reception on weekday evenings.  My only complaint is that the food and drink go quickly so get there early.  You could use this as a dinner if you wanted.  I got there about 45 minutes after it started and although there was food left there were very few soft drinks left (no diet).  They could improve by keeping the area stocked throughout the period.  Anyway, the rooms are nice, beds are comfortable and area is safe.",
  "We got diverted to Tampa and decided to make the drive to Orlando but first we needed somewhere to eat. Wanting to avoid chain restaurants, yelp steered us towards this little local gem!  The ladies had the 7 oz. Tampa strip and the gents both had a 14 oz. ribeye. They grill their steaks over oak and citrus Wood and the smoky flavor is to die for! We are big fans of our smoker back home and cook our steaks this way as well, it's rare to find steak cooked over woodsmoke in most places and this was worth the side trip!  Sides were veggies and sweet potatoes. The wines on offer were so reasonably priced- most under $20 a bottle but a decent selection. They just don't mark them up 5x like most places!   Our waitress Lisa also made great recommendations and her service was welcoming, friendly, and excellent. We are so glad we went local instead of to a chain. Bookmarking this place for a return trip next time I am in Tampa for sure!",
  "The owner of this location (and two others including Southampton) reached out to me after my previous review. We ended up talking for half an hour and I was very impressed with his approach to business... he's definitely the type of person I want to do business with. I returned to Saladworks on two separate occasions and the service had vastly improved. The new summer salads are wonderful!",
  "By far the best deli I have ever been to in the US. YEP, the US. Lots of crazy choices and oh it is hard to pick!! The Muffalata is so big 4 people can share. It is so tasty and amazing! Go on Saturday or Thursday night when they have live music! The special is always a good pick and don't worry there are plenty of sides to choose from. Great Chili, potato salad and of course chips. GO NOW...",
  "My dad and I are on a cross country trip and one of our first stops was Saguaro National Park.  We did a quick tour with Park Ranger Carolyn and loved it. She was incredibly enthusiastic and passionate about her studies on the saguaro and she was very knowledgeable. Definitely recommend both the tour and Carolyn.",
  "Came here after my husband bought home their lemon pepper wings. They have plenty of flavors. Ranging from ones you've heard of (lemon pepper, mild) to New Orleans flavors (yaka mein, noonie bird). They also have their drinks. The watermelon is to die for. I don't know what they put in it but lord help them. The location isn't the best but they're trying to put something back in the community. It's in the same section with the daiquiri shop so it's really not that bad during the day. I probably wouldn't come at night by myself. Definitely give this place a try. Hey you might even see Skip.",
  "Back to Tom Jones and time to update my review. I didn't see that odd ATM type machine that only lets you withdraw money to apply to your check. It's no longer there-used to be next to restrooms. There is still a payphone back there which I love. There are now ATM's at front entrance.   The blue ribbon is now $3.79, but still a bargain since it includes everything: pancakes, 2 eggs, toast, sausage, bacon,juice & coffee. I ate here with my kids. My daughter's choice. Says she \"loves Tom Jones\". Our meals included blue ribbons, french toast, chicken, club sandwich & baked potato . Everyone gets what they like.     I don't smell stale smoke and would not call it dirty.  I like the \"loud\" orange booths. I feel like I went back in time with these and the payphone. Service is always fast and I always seem to get a different waitress. Don't know where they find these young ladies but they're good. I've seen different managers there and they are all quick and on top of things-which makes a good manager.    Since it's my daughter's fave I'm bumping it up from 4 to 5 stars.",
  "I am an amateur athlete. I first met Dr. Ferrel when I was playing softball. He was watching my game when I was severely injured.  He treated me on the field by relocating my ankle and then told me to come to his office for treatment. I told him I could not afford that as a single mom on a teacher's salary. Instead, I saw a physician. He said it would be months before I would play again. Depressed and without much hope, I reached out to Dr. Ferrel again. He did treat me as he promised. Not only did he treat me, he healed me within weeks instead of months. Over the years Dr. Ferrel has worked on me with amazing results each time. He will always be my hero...",
  "Always fun to go to their shows.  Entertaining and relaxed atmosphere. For a good time and good food at a fair price this is the place to go.",
  "Love in n out. There's just a mood for in n out that you have to fulfill sometimes.  What can I say. 4 patties animal style bruh",
  "Cindy is the best! Great food and service. Food is authentic and so is the staff. Everything is made fresh and you can taste the difference from other Mexican restaurants at first bite. I would recommend to anyone that enjoys Mexican cuisine.",
  "I've been wanting to try Trust Me BBQ for over a year now.  I stopped in there about 3 months ago and waited in line for 10 minutes with no service and left.  After reading reviews, I figured I'd give it a chance again just to see what all the fuss is about.  The food was 50/50 but the service was horrible so I'll likely never return.  The gentleman behind the counter didn't speak, smile or engage with us at all, I felt like I was at a vending machine.  Once we finally ordered, he didn't even listen to the order and put the wrong sides in our meals, we had to correct him while he was serving.  All in all, I will just stick with Down to the Bone BBQ  Pros:  BBQ Sauce is delicious, macaroni salad was different and interesting, \"pulled\" pork was moist.  Cons:  Chicken was more dry than a sheet of paper, inedible even with the BBQ Sauce.  Mac & Cheese was served from a pan that has probably been on the steam table for 2-3 days.  Collard Greens were very mildly flavored.",
  "Was in town for a week and came by this little hole in the wall.  The pa nang chicken was excellent.  I ordered one star spicy and it came quick.  Will definitely return.",
  "Cinco de mayo means margaritas and sangria and all things fried... this great place does a nice job with combining flavors of several different ethnicities and backgrounds and develops recipes that are unique.  Although not touted as a \"Mexican\" destination they know how to rock the rock salt and pour that tequila.  They also just opened a wine bar a couple doors down for overflow and specialty bottles.  A high five for the on the rocks margaritas and house made white or red sangria - definitely worth the trip!",
  "This small little donut bakery is located in one of Hermitage's oldest shopping centers!   I can imagine baking donuts is a hard job, let alone running the business...it's one of those jobs that starts in the wee hours of the morning so that the donuts are freshly made daily!  Yeu, the owner, serves not only your common popular donuts, but he also serves donuts with bacon on top, apple fritters, pigs in a blanket, breakfast pastries, and  kolaches....in addition to these yummy treats...he makes doughssants....they are what seems to be a scandalous marriage of a donut and a croissant...!!!!!!!! Need I say more? Yeah...you heard me. A doughssant! Worth the trip just to eat one of these!   Prices are considerably cheap! The doughssants are only $1.99 each! The regular donuts are about $.60 each!   These sweet donuts are my favorite treats to buy for my kid's school teachers...and they love them!   Coffee also served here!",
  "We have had a blast to each event we've been to.  We've been to concerts and basketball games and other were a lot of fun.  The food is really good, also.  A lot of local favorites are offered.",
  "Excellent food. We tried three appetizers and five entries and all of them were a hit. This prices are reasonable and the service is good. I'd go back again and again.",
  "The service here has gone down. We used to go here a lot but now we go to another one. The service was slow and forgotten about.",
  "Hands down the worst chicken and rice plate I've ever had. When I ordered I was told there was no sauce on the chicken (as I wanted, healthy). I ordered to go, by the time I reached the car the bag was full of oil spilling out of the container. There was easily 5-7 tablespoons of oil on the dish. Not what I was told and not what anyone would ever want to eat. Horrible.   Their slogan even has the word healthy in it. What a joke.",
  "Great experience purchasing a washer and dryer.  I just bought a new home and needed all new appliances. Iam so glad I decided to go even though the reviews were not great which I don't understand since I had no issues whatsoever. There was an excellent selection, knowledgeable salespeople and timely delivery. The level of service we received was beyond expected! I really felt like they were working hard to give me the best price and offered many options to stay in my budget  They even took the time to check if there were any additional sales prices or discounts they could offer me. I was given honest feedback and all of my questions were answered. I am very happy with Sears and I would highly recommend!",
  "The food here is great. They're quick and the staff is so nice, seriously. I always feel welcome when I place my order here.",
  "I finally got to try them. Wow..they did a great job with the remodle. I loved the mushroom cheese steak",
  "The espresso here is excellent. My favorite place to come for an Americano. The staff is polite and friendly and vibes are mellow. It is important to know that there is no access to power outlets, but unlimited wifi access. The bathrooms and the rest of the establishment are always clean.",
  "Went here based on the high ratings and raves from people.  The entire experience was underwhelming from start to finish.  Their website which is fairly useless if you want to figure out the menu before going, you have to pick your location choice out of 3 locations and then drill down to the bottom to see the weak descriptions of their menu offering, no explanations and no price, just this      Roast Beef     Roast Beef Combo     Roast Pork     Roast Pork Combo     Baked Ham     Baked Ham Combo     Roast Turkey     Roast Turkey Combo     Broccoli Rabe     Broccoli Rabe Combo   No explanation of whats in a combo (its just where they add cheese by the way)  The table placecard (instead of menu) had a more detailed description than the website.    When I walked in, its more bar than restaurant, no big deal, but there were tables.  Since I couldnt decide and the sandwiches werent too expensive at $6.85, I got the roast beef and roast port combos.  I got my two sandwiches fast enough, but the roast beef was cold and the roast pork was hot.  Not sure how a cook (for lack of a better word) could serve 2 things at the same time with such a temperature differential, one was obviously sitting for awhile.  I asked the waitress to reheat the roast beef while I finished the roast pork, and supposedly it was reheated, since it was warmer, but it was still cold-ish compared to my roast pork I had just finished.  The waitress did offer to replace it when she inquired, but I was in a hurry and didnt really care for a hot version of this sandwich.  The sandwiches were very skimpy on meat, but they \"made up for it\" by adding too much gravy to make it overly messy and the bread was disintegrating.  The menu place card mentions the \"wet meat\" option where you get less gravy, I strongly recommend you get it that style, especially if the gravy overpower the meat and structural integrity of the sandwich.",
  "Picked up takeout from Village Whiskey (so I can't review the actual restaurant). The Whiskey Burger is pricy ($26) but is amazing if you're ok with a greasier burger. Super tender, the bacon is awesome and it's pretty big. If you can get past the price then highly recommend it. The Duck Fat fries are also rich and delicious.",
  "Blew $80 on food for the family was worth it food was hot and orange chicken best I've tasted in a awhile..now it will be the place we get Asian food!!",
  "I typically do my laundry at my boyfriend's house, but I had family who recently stayed with me and had a bunch of towels, sheets, and comforters to wash.  I was searching for a laundry mat that would be safe, clean and not full of questionable people.  I was so happy to find this facility.  It is clean, well-lit, and the staff is so friendly and helpful.  I was amazed at the speed of the laundry and dryer.  I completed 4 oversize loads ( probably equal to 8 regular loads) in just under 2 hours!  This place has security cameras, flat screen T.V's, magazines, wi-fi, clean bathrooms, vending machines.  It is a wonderful atmosphere to do your laundry.  It was not overly busy, there are plenty of washers and dryers.  I am so happy that I found this place.  Thank you LAUNDROMAT!!!",
  "We ran in for a late night dinner last night. The prices are definitely high. Both couples decided to split a plate (you could tell the annoyed our server), and the food was good- but not worth the price for sure. I will say the garlic bread they bring out before the meal was AH-MAZING! I could have probably eaten my weight in just the bread.   Overall - I probably wouldn't eat there again myself. But it could have been an off night. There is just too much competition in the food world around St Louis!",
  "Stopped by to munch a burger during today's Seahawks/Saints game, and the place was, unsurprisingly, packed. For good reason, too: the Haven burger I ordered was fantastic.  I sat right next to the door, so I didn't get the chance to get more than six feet into the place; as soon as I got my meal, the place started getting busier and busier until I had to work my way through the World's Shortest People Maze to get out. Guess that means I wasn't the first person to hear about the place.  I will be going back to the Haven. Might go for, say lunch on a Tuesday, so it's less busy.",
  "I can only comment on the vermicelli bowls because I have never had the Pho.   The vermicelli are a decent size and a fair price. Conveniently located if you live in the Alberta Ave neighbourhood, my orders have always been ready in 15 minutes - even on a Friday night.",
  "I had the Chicken Marsala recommended by our waiter. The chicken was very thin, tough, and dry. The pasta was under cooked and stuck together. There was absolutely no flavor. My friend ordered the lasagne and did not like it all. There was only a thin layer of pasta and no flavor. My other friend was still eating her dinner and they cleared her plate when she went to the restroom, after she told the waiter she was not finished. They did bring her a new meal in a doggie bag. The positives are a Great atmosphere and live music. I enjoyed dancing with my husband. However, very expensive for awful food.",
  "This place is a gem.Attractive space, great location near Broad Street line, plenty on street parking. BYOB. I've been twice and enjoyed every dish. Highlights were the chaats, beef short ribs, lamb vindaloo, beet salad, breads/pickles, and chai. We got the chocolate cake for the table to share each time and everyone loved it. Can get takeout beer at the corner bar. We'll be back.",
  "This is my favorite restaurant!  I always order their ceviche, which is delicious.  The atmosphere is fun, and the service is great.  Alex was our server, and he was friendly, attentive and thoughtful.",
  "Love this store!  Who doesn't!  The salad bar is fresh and they have all types of ethnic food to try.  N-JOY",
  "Called in a Mediterranean chicken shawarma. Good flavor and they were generous with the amount of chicken in the pita. The food was ready to go when I arrived. Good service. I would revisit the next time I am in the area.",
  "I love this place.  The food is great and the space and staff are very pleasant.  Highly recommended for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike.",
  "Took a while to get actual service but once we did I was happy. The gumbo was awesome and loved the chicken & waffles. Friendly staff and right on Bourbon St for good people watching!",
  "As airport grab-and-go restaurants are, Earl does a decent job with a variety of sandwich options including turkey, tuna and even a Hawaiian. But today I could smell the roast beef and so I got that one. Yum. Good portion of sliced beef that was beyond medium cooked with cheddar cheese and a yummy horseradish sauce. Nope, don't get lettuce or tomatoes on it. It's perfect the way it is.  And since it's right between the security station and the top of the D gates (right near the Delta SkyClub!), it's easy to get and eat at the gate or on board.",
  "WOW!  What a fantastic place!  Food A+, Service A+++  We started with an appetizer of cheese curds served with a red pepper jelly.  LOVED IT!  I ordered the fish tacos and the wife ordered a beer brat for dinner.  We both thoroughly enjoyed what we ordered!  The portions were huge and priced just right for the portion size.  Our server was on it!  Very attentive and was very knowledgeable about the menu and made us feel very welcomed.  The manager stopped by and asked how everything was.  I let him know that I am pretty sure I have found a cool new place to hang out, have a beer and watch football.  He said they have great deals on game days and let us know about their brunch on the weekends.  Everyone said goodbye as we walked out and reminded us to grab a rootbeer candy on our way out.  I will be back!",
  "I stopped in for dinner and a drink & was thoroughly pleased! I rarely order a burger when I go out to eat, because why order \"out\" what you can make easily a home, right? Well..... when I go back I'll have a hard time NOT getting another burger. Oh, they also have a decent beer selection and the wait staff/bartenders made me feel very welcomed too.  My food was prepared exactly as I ordered and was served quickly.  The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and the restrooms were clean.  All in all I was very happy! ."
