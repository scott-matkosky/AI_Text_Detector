["Get ready for a culinary adventure that'll take you on a wild ride - literally! If you're brave enough to dine here, buckle up for a 2-hour extravaganza from start to finish! I've given this place multiple chances because I'm rooting for it - I've had amazing experiences at its NJ locations, and I want to love it just as much! The food is on point, but be prepared to wait... and wait... and wait some more! The young waitstaff is usually super friendly, but we've had one too many marathon dining sessions. That's why we often opt for a quicker bite at another diner or restaurant on weekends. So, if you're in no rush and ready to hang loose, this might be the spot for you!", "I've been spinning for years, but nothing beats the experience at Body Cycle. From the sleek, clean studio and top-of-the-line bikes to the motivating instructors who make you feel welcome, every class is a killer workout. Plus, their online scheduling system makes it a breeze to plan ahead - no need to wait in line for hours like at other gyms. I have to give a special shout-out to Russell, the owner, who's passion for fitness and cycling is infectious. He's always popping into classes to check in and offer encouragement, and he's open to feedback and suggestions. And despite pushing you to your limits, he always wears a smile on his face - it's inspiring!", "I recently visited a family-friendly diner located next to the Clarion Hotel. I opted for the buffet, which offered an eclectic assortment of dishes, including a large chicken leg, crispy fried jalape\u00f1o, a traditional tamale, two rolled grape leaves, and fresh melon. I was pleased to find that everything tasted great. The buffet featured a wide variety of Mexican-inspired options. In addition to the buffet, the diner also offers a menu with breakfast items available all day long. The staff were friendly and attentive, making it an ideal spot for a casual, low-key meal with no frills. Overall, I would recommend this diner for a relaxed dining experience.", "We highly recommend this restaurant! Our top picks are the lamb curry and korma, and they offer an impressive 10 varieties of naan. Don't be put off by the exterior - it's worth going inside and trying something new. You won't regret it!", "The interior of the establishment is charming, and the owner provided us with a tour of the forthcoming patio and rooftop area, which promises to be an excellent spot to enjoy on pleasant days like today. The cheese curds were exceptional and quite filling. We appreciated that the sandwiches came accompanied by a salad, particularly after indulging in the curds. I opted for the onion, gruyere, and tomato sandwich, which struck a nice balance in terms of cheese content. However, I felt that it required an additional element, such as pepper jelly, to elevate the flavor profile. It would be beneficial to see the menu expanded to include more options, such as salads featuring unique and artisanal cheeses. The beverage selection is extensive, with a wide range of beers and wines, as well as a limited cocktail menu. On my next visit, I intend to try one of the draft wines.", "As a loyal customer, I'm disappointed that I was turned away for takeout when the restaurant was only half full. I'm a frequent visitor and always leave generous tips. With Kanella now open, I'll be taking my business elsewhere and won't be returning to Dmitri's.", "I had an absolutely fantastic experience on this tour! The affordable price, courtesy of a Groupon deal, was the icing on the cake. As a newcomer to New Orleans with limited knowledge of its rich history, this tour proved to be the perfect introduction to the city. Our knowledgeable and engaging tour guide regaled us with a plethora of fascinating anecdotes about the city, making the experience truly unforgettable. I would highly recommend this tour to anyone seeking a comprehensive and enjoyable exploration of New Orleans. Initially, I assumed the tour would solely focus on the cemetery, but our guide cleverly structured the itinerary to include a captivating hour-long stroll through the historic French Quarter, followed by a riveting visit to the cemetery in the second half. The meeting point in front of a local grocery store may seem unusual at first, but it's easily locatable and provides a convenient opportunity to grab a refreshing drink before embarking on the adventure. Additionally, a midpoint stop at a visitor center allows for a brief respite and bathroom break, if needed. This tour was undoubtedly one of the highlights of my trip, and I would enthusiastically endorse it to anyone seeking a memorable experience in New Orleans.", "Get ready for a culinary explosion! The wings at this hidden gem are truly sublime, paired to perfection with their signature homemade bleu cheese that will leave you craving for more. And if that's not enough, the ribeye is a masterclass in tender, juicy goodness, cooked to perfection and bursting with flavor. To wash it all down, a curated selection of craft beers awaits, guaranteed to satisfy even the most discerning palate. Trust us, you won't want to miss this incredible dining experience - it's a must-visit destination that will leave you wanting more!", "This Easter, we opted for a trip to Los Padres National Forest instead of Lopez Lake. While the forest is truly breathtaking, our visit to White Rock was slightly marred by the overgrowth of dead grass on the rocks and in the water. It would be wonderful if the forest staff could clear this debris to restore the area's natural beauty. The water's greenish hue and murky appearance were also a concern. To maintain the forest's pristine condition, the staff at Los Padres National Forest need to prioritize upkeep and maintenance. In comparison, Cachuma Lake seems to receive more attention, making it a more appealing destination.", "So we had a group of 6 in for hibachi and it was a bit of a mess. Our waitress brought out our individual sushi orders all on one plate, which was super confusing, and she even forgot some stuff. I get that mistakes happen, but it was pretty dead in there, so you'd think they'd be on top of things. Usually, hibachi is a blast, but our cook, Francisco, barely said a word - although he did cook the food really well. The service was pretty meh, the food was okay, and I'm hoping it was just a one-off bad night. But honestly, for the price, I wouldn't come back.", "I had an absolutely phenomenal experience with Shalimar! When I needed my engagement ring resized, I was thrilled to hear that they could possibly do it within the day. The team confirmed the same-day service and quoted me a reasonable $40 for the job. I double-checked my size, gave the thumbs up, and left them to work their magic. But when I returned later that afternoon, I was dismayed to find the ring was too small. The twist? It was my mistake - I should've opted for a half-size up! \n\nTo my surprise, the Shalimar team was incredibly understanding and accommodating. They resized the ring again, this time to perfection, and handed it back to me within an hour - all at no extra cost! Their kindness and professionalism in the face of my embarrassing error won me over instantly. I'm forever grateful for this exceptional experience and can't wait to return to Shalimar for all my future jewelry needs!", "Locals raved about Milktooth, and it truly is a hidden gem in Indianapolis. I'm glad I had the opportunity to experience it.", "Unwind in style at this hotspot, where happy hour and dinner dreams come true! Escape the sweltering St. Louis heat on their fabulous patio, complete with refreshing fans to keep you cool and comfortable. But what really sets this place apart is their exceptional service - the team is always happy to accommodate your every need! And, be sure to try their mouthwatering Veal Milanese, expertly modified to swap out pasta for fresh mixed greens - a game-changing twist that's sure to delight your taste buds. The best part? They're more than willing to tailor their menu to your unique preferences, making every visit a truly personalized experience!", "Savoring every bite, I indulged in the heavenly gnocchi smothered in rich marinara sauce, and the crispy baked eggplant appetizer that left me craving for more. Although the service was glacially slow, the culinary masterpiece on my plate made it well worth the wait. I'd eagerly return, as the exceptional flavors have left an indelible mark on my palate.", "The bun is what makes the Sonoran Dog stand out. It's like a cozy blanket that wraps around the hot dog, making it warm, soft, and fragrant. At first, it may seem like too much, but it actually works well. The hot dog itself is flavorful, although I think it could benefit from a bit more snap to balance out the strong flavors of the mustard and onions. The carne asada caramelo is also excellent, with a great tortilla, salty cheese, and tender meat. Plus, it's very affordable and you can even drive through to pick it up.", "Excellent breakfast spot! The waffle was fluffy and perfect, and the home fries were crispy and delicious. Friendly service too. I'll definitely return!", "Exceptional dining experience! Douglas provided outstanding service that perfectly complemented the delectable cuisine. While the prices are steep (averaging $40-50 per entree), the upscale atmosphere rivals that of the nation's top restaurants, making it well worth the splurge.", "My husband and I are repeat customers at this restaurant, and we've consistently had exceptional dining experiences. The staff, from servers to bartenders, are extremely knowledgeable about the menu and have always been able to suggest modifications to accommodate my gluten intolerance. The wine and cocktail lists are impressive, and the food is truly exceptional. My only suggestion would be to add gluten-free dessert options, as we've had to go elsewhere for something sweet. However, this minor drawback doesn't deter us from returning to this fantastic restaurant again and again.", "I'm obsessed with my go-to blow bar, where the talented Natalie works her magic on my brows! As a brow specialist, she truly delivers - my eyebrows have never looked better! But the real game-changer was when I had the pleasure of getting a blowout from Victoria. I was blown away (pun intended!) by the incredible volume she achieved on my thin, straight, and lifeless locks. It was a total transformation! I've tried another stylist since, but no one compares to Victoria - she's my girl for life! And let's not forget the salon itself - it's a stunning, spotless oasis that makes you feel like royalty from the moment you step inside.", "This is my favorite cafe in the city. I love their black and white latte - it's not too sweet and has just the right amount of foam. Their soups are always delicious, even if you're not a big soup fan. The cafe is also very spacious, making it a great place to work. The noise level is just right, the music is not too loud, and I enjoy seeing customers bring their dogs. I'll definitely keep going back to this cafe as long as I can.", "Holy smokes! I was blown away by the actual pumpkin pie mixed into the frozen custard. It's unbelievable that this hasn't become a nationwide sensation yet! The best part? The chunks of pie crust scattered throughout - it was like finding a diamond inside another diamond. Super yummy!", "Upland Brewery, headquartered in Bloomington, Indiana, has garnered sufficient acclaim to warrant the establishment of additional locations throughout central Indiana. Their entire repertoire of beers is exceptional, and I must confess that their burgers and tenderloins have also earned my admiration. Consequently, I was eager to sample their pizza offerings, but unfortunately, they failed to meet my lofty expectations. The margherita pizza I ordered featured a crust reminiscent of a cracker, and its overall flavor profile was somewhat lacking. While the cheese was of high quality, the other toppings contributed little to the dish's flavor complexity. Notably, the absence of red sauce, a traditional component of a classic margherita pizza, was a significant omission. In my opinion, Upland's pizza may serve as a suitable accompaniment to a group gathering, but I will continue to opt for their burgers or tenderloins as my preferred meal choice during future visits.", "I had a great time at the show - a perfect way to unwind on a Friday night.", "This sushi spot is the only game in town, but it's a convenient lifesaver when you're in the mood for sushi and short on time. The standout star on their menu is undoubtedly the salmon, which we always make a point to order. Other favorites of ours include their spicy edamame, crispy tempura, refreshing ocean salad, and crunchy cabbage salad. Plus, the service is consistently friendly and efficient!", "I was torn between 3 and 4 stars for this location. As a huge fan of the 96th street Naked Tchopstix, I was excited to try this closer location. However, the vibe is distinctly different, with a greater emphasis on take-out and a smaller dining area. You order at the counter and they deliver your food. My daughter and I opted for the sushi bowl, which allows you to customize your meal by selecting proteins, vegetables, rice, and toppings on a paper menu. I appreciated the clarity of this system, but found the vegetable options to be limited and the rice-to-food ratio to be off. The sauces were a highlight, though. My husband's Maui roll, a favorite of mine from the 96th street location, didn't quite live up to the standard. While it was good, the quality and consistency were lacking. Despite this, I would return and think many people would enjoy the sushi bowls. I do want to address the negative reviews regarding service: this is a sushi restaurant, not a fast-food joint, so patience is required. As a healthy alternative to fast food in the area, the wait is worth it. On a separate note, the bubble tea is a must-try - I loved the strawberry flavor and plan to try the vanilla chai next time.", "I enjoyed a delicious lunch today! The beef brisket sandwich was outstanding, boasting incredible juiciness and tenderness. The pulled pork was equally impressive, matching the sandwich in flavor and quality.", "Hands down, the most amazing Thai food in the area! Every single dish was ridiculously authentic and mouth-wateringly delicious. I'm already counting down the days until I can go back and devour it all again... and again... and again!", "I was really disappointed with my dining experience. The service was poor and the food was just okay. I regret not choosing a different restaurant for my last dinner in town.", "I'm still raving about the dinner my wife and I had here over the weekend! The meal was seriously impressive. We were blown away by how fast our food arrived - it was like they knew we were starving! And the best part? Everything tasted like it was made from scratch, which we both loved. The only downside was deciding what to order, because let's be real, the menu was packed with way too many delicious options. We're already planning our next visit to try more dishes. Can't wait to see what the chef comes up with next!", "I'm giving this place two stars at least because the food was pretty decent. But, man, the service was a whole different story. I was there for a dinner meeting and we dropped $100 on apps and entrees, so you'd think they'd be on top of things. Nope. I had to track down the assistant cook (the dude in bright red baggy pants watching TV, btw) just to ask for more avocado on my tuna dish. And let me tell you, he made it super clear that he wasn't about to help me out. I had to flag down my waitress just so she could charge me an extra four bucks for the avocado. Ridiculous.", "I had the pleasure of dining at this establishment for the first time, and I must say it was an exceptional experience. Upon entering, I was struck by the warm and inviting atmosphere, reminiscent of being a guest in someone's home. The wait staff were not only courteous but also possessed a delightful sense of humor. The service was prompt, with our meals arriving in a timely manner. The cuisine was truly phenomenal, and I would highly recommend this restaurant. I certainly plan to return in the future.", "Enjoy delicious burgers, crispy fries, and fresh salads at this charming location! The burgers stand out with a perfect balance of salt and pepper flavor. The quaint atmosphere is enhanced by outdoor seating, making it a lovely spot to dine. The friendly staff adds to the welcoming vibe. Plus, parking is convenient with both street parking and a lot in the back.", "The exceptional staff at this establishment consistently provide outstanding assistance and exhibit a friendly demeanor. The store's impressive size and immaculate cleanliness create a welcoming atmosphere. Moreover, the inventory is always well-stocked with a wide range of essential items. The staff's willingness to accommodate special requests is particularly noteworthy, as they take the time to craft my custom breakfast bagel to perfection.", "I brought my vehicle to this shop a few years ago to address a manufacturer recall. After the repair, the initial problem was resolved, but I soon noticed a new noise that I thought was related. However, it turned out to be a separate issue altogether. To my surprise, Kevin and his mechanic not only diagnosed the problem but also fixed it free of charge, despite my offer to pay. I was impressed by their honesty and integrity. I highly recommend this shop and its outstanding team!", "Following my recent review of a different Sweet CeCe's location, I realized I had overlooked my local go-to spot. I must express my enthusiasm for their product - it's truly exceptional. The variety of toppings is also noteworthy, striking a great balance between healthy and indulgent options. While I've occasionally encountered minor service issues, such as inattentive staff or a need to remind them of promotions (like $5 Friday), my overall satisfaction with Sweet CeCe's cannot be overstated. As a result, I feel compelled to award it a minimum of 4 stars, reflecting my genuine appreciation for this establishment.", "Love this Funk Zone addition! Enjoy a bite and wine tastings next to the Santa Barbara Wine Collective (they share tables). The savory croissant is a must-try!", "Relaxing massage spot with easy same-day appointments. Never been disappointed with any therapist!", "We arrived at the Peppermill around 2:30 pm and were pleased to find that check-in was a breeze, complete with complimentary valet parking - a lovely touch. The resort's grandeur reminded us of Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, with its vast array of amenities. On site, we discovered eight restaurants catering to diverse tastes, and a casino area that rivaled those found in Las Vegas.\n\nHowever, we were surprised to find that many of the slot machines, advertised as \"penny machines,\" actually had minimum bets ranging from 30 cents to $5. This felt like false advertising to us.\n\nOur accommodations were located in the Tuscany Tower on the 12th floor, offering a stunning view of the expansive pool area. Our spacious room came equipped with free WiFi, a generous bathroom featuring a large shower with two shower heads, a TV, and a large jetted bathtub. The bathroom also boasted dual sinks, ample counter space, and a plentiful supply of towels. The main area was equally impressive, with a king-sized bed, nightstands, a closet, TV, mini fridge, dresser, safe, computer table, and three comfortable chairs and a table. To top it off, the thermostat maintained a comfortable temperature throughout our stay.\n\nThroughout our visit, we encountered courteous and helpful staff, making our stay at the Peppermill a truly enjoyable experience.", "As a busy professional, I'm always on the lookout for a reliable lunch spot that can deliver on quality and speed. Today, I convinced my boyfriend to try out a new deli with me, and I'm thrilled to report that it exceeded my expectations. The menu was overwhelming in the best possible way - with a vast array of options ranging from healthy salads and soups to comforting macaroni and hot food. I opted for a satisfying turkey, avocado, and bacon panini, while my boyfriend devoured a spicy buffalo chicken wrap. The best part? We didn't have to sacrifice our precious lunch hour waiting for our food. We'll definitely be back to explore more of what this deli has to offer.", "Get ready for a flavor explosion! Amazing biscuits and mouth-watering brunch dishes that will leave you craving for more! And to top it off, their craft cocktails are simply incredible! Highly, highly recommended - but be prepared for a lively atmosphere, as this hotspot can get pretty bustling!", "The food was good, and the atmosphere and decor resembled a cozy fishing lodge. The menu fell somewhere between Outback and Bonefish. We visited using a Groupon and were impressed that all three of our meals, as well as the calamari appetizer we ordered, were cooked to perfection. We will definitely be back!", "Honest Review: Hits and Misses\n\nLet's get straight to it - this place is budget-friendly, but unfortunately, you get what you pay for. The good news is that the price and location are convenient, and their desserts are a highlight! Some edible options include baked and fried chicken, mashed potatoes, a salad bar, a meat and cheese bar, ravioli, and pizza. Our waitress was also super friendly and attentive.\n\nOn the meh side, the behind-the-counter meat slicing station could use some improvement, and the shrimp (which weren't even deveined) and Mexican station were just okay.\n\nUnfortunately, there were some major misses. The breakfast options were a letdown, especially the eggs - they were honestly the worst I've ever had. The Eggs Benedict was also a disappointment, with ham and English muffins that were impossible to cut through. The steak and shrimp didn't impress either, and the breaded items were a no-go. To top it off, the decor felt like a blast from the past - think 1970s nightmare.\n\nAfter giving it three tries, I'm afraid I won't be back.", "I would have given this restaurant a 5-star rating if it weren't for one pretentious waiter who ruined our initial experience. As a guest at Hotel Palomar, the restaurant's location was a major plus. On our first night, we met for cocktails and took a seat at the bar since the host staff were busy. However, our waiter was less than welcoming, responding to our request to sit with an irritated tone and making us feel like an inconvenience. Despite this, we tried to make the best of it, but his distant demeanor and reluctance to accommodate our request to split the bill left a bad taste in our mouths.\n\nFortunately, we decided to give the restaurant another chance the following night, making sure to avoid our previous waiter. This time, we were greeted by a friendly bartender named Ben, who made us feel welcome and valued. He was knowledgeable, enthusiastic, and genuinely invested in our experience, recommending cocktails and sharing his expertise on whiskey. Ben exceeded our expectations and redeemed the restaurant from our previous poor experience.\n\nI also had the pleasure of ordering room service from the restaurant, which was exceptional. The bacon-wrapped dates and chocolate cake were outstanding. Overall, this is a great restaurant with amazing bartenders, but unfortunately, one bad waiter almost spoiled the experience.", "Dropped in after a leisurely Sunday morning stroll in the park and was delighted by the excellent food, coffee, and top-notch customer service. The atmosphere in here is absolutely wonderful!", "UNDERWHELMING EXPERIENCE! The excruciating wait for our food was only the beginning. The burger, ordered medium rare, arrived charred to a crisp - a culinary abomination. The Seafood Jumbalaya was the sole redeeming quality, but even that was merely decent. The hefty price tag was a slap in the face. With so many exceptional eateries in the French Quarter, this overhyped establishment failed to impress. It wasn't a complete disaster, but the hype surrounding this place was grossly overstated.", "This hidden gem exceeded my expectations in every way! The bed was incredibly comfortable, the breakfast was delicious, and the internet was lightning-fast. Plus, its prime location made exploring a breeze. And the best part? It was all at an unbeatable price. My only tip would be to request a lower floor if you're not a morning person, as the elevator wait times can be up to 15 minutes during peak hours. But overall, I was thoroughly impressed with this fantastic find!", "AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE! This so-called \"restaurant\" is a total joke. They only do one thing right - cooking food. Everything else? You're on your own, buddy! Thirsty? Get up and trek across the yard to grab a glass of water. Craving a drink? Take a hike up the stairs and fork over some cash. And don't even get me started on the \"dining area\" - a grimy yard with filthy lawn chairs. The wait staff? Barely helpful. They'll deign to bring you your food, but only after you've paid cash at the window. It's like a dirty, live-music-infused version of New Orleans Hamburger and Seafood. Trust me, once is enough. I'll never set foot in this dump again!", "Customization lovers, rejoice! This eatery is your playground, where every topping and condiment comes with a price tag. The food? Decent, but not exactly a flavor bomb. The real excitement lies in the \u00e0 la carte adventure.\n\nOur journey began with a complimentary basket of chips and a side of tomato sauce, which I politely upgraded to something spicier and a dollop of pico de gallo. The salsa was a game-changer, but the real surprise came when I asked for a Coke and was presented with a bottle. When I requested a fountain drink, our server casually mentioned they only had Pepsi on tap. Who knew?\n\nWe ordered our meals, which were reasonably priced, but soon discovered that sour cream and cheese came with an extra fee. And if you want an extra basket of chips? That'll be $2.50, please.\n\nThe final bill was a shocker: we paid more for the fixin's than the food itself! A side of sour cream set us back $2, pico de gallo was $2.50, salsa was $2, chips were $2.50, and that unwanted bottled Coke? A whopping $5.\n\nMoral of the story: when you order, ask about those extra charges. Trust us, your wallet will thank you.", "The cafe was absolutely adorable. When we arrived at 8am, we were treated to a lovely surprise - a live jazz band performance. I opted for the breakfast sandwich, which was not only delicious but also cleverly presented, with rolled eggs and crispy bacon pieces tucked inside. The best part? It was a great value for a filling breakfast!", "This place is truly exceptional! I was initially drawn in by the promise of their famous duckfat French fries. For my son's birthday, we put our name in and waited about 45 minutes, enjoying a drink around the corner. We were seated at the bar, where we were greeted by Keith, the friendly and knowledgeable bartender. He was an all-around cool guy who knew his whiskeys inside out.\n\nWe started with three Cape May Salts (two for me, one for my son) and an order of tater tots, both of which exceeded my expectations. For dinner, I opted for the Kentucky Fried Quail, which was outstanding, although the succotash was slightly underwhelming. My son, on the other hand, indulged in the $24 Fois Gras burger, which was incredible and well worth the price. The duckfat fries were delicious, but surprisingly, not the highlight of the meal. I could have done without the cheese sauce, but since it was served on the side, it didn't detract from my overall experience.\n\nI'm already looking forward to returning to this restaurant with all my friends and family!", "Warning: Disappointment Ahead! Our recent visit to this establishment was a letdown from the start. The artichoke dip, a seemingly safe bet, arrived cold and was paired with stale chips. When we brought it to our waitress's attention, our concerns fell on deaf ears. The large thin-crust pizza we ordered was overpriced, especially considering the lackluster flavor. While our server was friendly, she failed to advocate for us when it mattered most. Having had a better experience here during a Cardinals game in the past, this visit was a stark contrast. Needless to say, we'll be taking our business (and appetites) elsewhere next time.", "For my fianc\u00e9's birthday, we opted for a casual Thai dinner at Jasmine Rice, a recommendation from Yelp. We initially wanted summer rolls, but they weren't available, so we settled for pan-fried dumplings instead. While the flavor was good, we wouldn't order them again. Our main courses, green curry fried rice with duck and chicken pad thai, were excellent. The duck was particularly impressive, being some of the tastiest I've ever had. The pad thai was a bit too sweet for our taste, but adding chili sauce improved it. Although our service was good, we noticed some issues with other tables, including a delayed meal for a group heading to the Kimmel Center and a missing item in a take-out order (which the owner kindly rectified). Overall, Jasmine Rice serves high-quality Thai food, and we'd definitely return.", "I'm obsessed with Courtney! She's literally the best hairstylist I've ever had the pleasure of sitting in her chair. What sets her apart is that she just gets me - she knows exactly what styles will make me look and feel amazing, and she's totally respectful of my boundaries. I love that I can just show up and be like, 'Hey, do your thing!' and trust that she'll work her magic. It's a total bonus that I don't have to spell out exactly what I want - she's got a keen eye for what needs to be done. Plus, she's super knowledgeable, has an awesome personality, and is just an all-around great human. If you want to look and feel your absolute best, Courtney is the stylist to see - trust me, you won't regret it!", "Discover a reliable and convenient solution for your car's needs at this trusted location! As a local resident, I've had the pleasure of frequenting this spot numerous times, and while it may not be the flashiest option, it consistently delivers when it counts. Whether you're due for an oil change or a state inspection, this place has got you covered. The secret to a seamless experience? Timing is everything - avoid peak hours and you'll be in and out in no time. Don't expect frills, but do expect solid, dependable service that gets the job done. A Pep Boys is a Pep Boys, but this one is a cut above the rest!", "Breathed new life into my home by swapping out two outdated 1970s Lennox units for two brand-new ones! The team did an outstanding job, and I'm thrilled to report that they've been humming along smoothly for three years now, providing reliable comfort and peace of mind.", "I highly recommend the Brewpub due to its diverse menu offerings, which include nachos, pizza, and sandwiches. Additionally, the establishment boasts an impressive selection of craft beers brewed on-site. While the service may be somewhat leisurely, I attribute this to the relaxed atmosphere of the restaurant. Rather than rushing through a meal, patrons can take advantage of the outdoor patio and enjoy the company of friends and family. The Brewpub is also an excellent choice for families with children and pets, as well as for individuals with vegetarian or vegan dietary preferences. Personally, I often opt for a half order of nachos or fish and chips. Furthermore, I was impressed by their seasonal Pumpkin Beer, which rivals some of my favorite pumpkin beers.", "Cozy home decor store with friendly staff who can help you decorate. Prices are affordable. We carry items from popular designers like Joanna Gaines (from the TV show Fixer Upper) and many more. It's a great home store in SB with prices that won't break the bank!", "I recently had a great experience at a local establishment with my brother. We stopped by to grab a six-pack of craft beers for a night in, but ended up staying for a few drinks and playing some classic Nintendo 64 games, including Super Smash Brothers, which was generously donated by fellow patrons. The atmosphere was warm and welcoming, with delicious food and genuinely friendly people. This place has all the makings of a Northeast staple and is definitely worth a visit.", "My go-to menu is coconut soup and pad thai with protein, which I decided to try here as well. I was pleasantly surprised by their coconut soup, which had just the right amount of coconut milk to make it rich and creamy without being overpowered by herbs. As someone who's accustomed to Americanized Thai cuisine, I prefer my dishes with less herbs, except for cilantro. The pad thai was also excellent, with a perfect balance of peanut flavor, chewy noodles, and just the right amount of sweetness. I was thrilled to receive a generous serving of chicken, and the white meat was juicy and not dry at all. Overall, I was very happy with my meal.", "I'm thoroughly impressed! This diner serves up fantastic comfort food and the best part - breakfast is available all day long! I stopped by for lunch and despite being busy, the staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming. Plus, it's conveniently located just off the 295, making it easy to get to.", "This bar has become my favorite spot to visit on Saturday nights. I was initially disappointed when Lucy's closed down, but I was pleasantly surprised to discover this new bar just across the street. The food here exceeds my expectations, and I always order their delicious wings and fries. Just be cautious when trying their 'WTF sauce'! One drawback is that it can take a while to get the bartender's attention, especially since the place is usually crowded. However, it's always exciting when the 'Always Sunny' crew stops by, making it a fun and lively atmosphere.", "Defying our initial skepticism about touristy eateries, we took a chance on the Shellfish Company on the Wharf, buoyed by its consistently stellar Yelp reviews. This small, popular spot requires advance planning, as waits are inevitable. We lucked out with a 20-minute wait, just as the dinner rush was subsiding. The real draw was the local rock crab special: 3 pounds of fresh California Rock Crab, paired with a generous salad and choice of soup or chowder, all for $25. The impressive presentation and generous portions of the salad and chowder combo set the tone for a fantastic meal. But the real star was the rock crab, which tasted as incredible as it looked. The juicy, buttery chunks of white crab meat were easily accessible, thanks to perfectly cooked shells that cracked open with ease. With an impressive amount of meat for minimal effort, this dish stole the show. We left thoroughly satisfied, convinced that ordering crab at the Shellfish Company is a safe bet and an exceptional value. In fact, it was one of the highlights of our trip.", "I strongly disagree with some of the negative reviews about Weaver's Way. This co-op isn't designed for quick, convenient shopping. As a single woman, I find it easy to shop here, even during peak hours. In fact, I appreciate that I can buy smaller quantities of items, which is perfect for someone living alone. I also enjoy the flexible work hours, which allow me to contribute to the community in various ways. The co-op's community is diverse and not just made up of stereotypical \"tree huggers.\" I value the opportunity to buy locally grown produce and natural, wholesome foods at prices lower than those at Whole Foods. I enjoy interacting with other members and contributing to my local and global community. While the membership fee and work hours may not be for everyone, I don't find them prohibitive as a single person. If you're committed to the co-op's values, it's an excellent place to shop. If not, you can always stick to chain stores or pay the visitor's fee to shop occasionally.", "While the food doesn't particularly impress me, many others rave about this place. I only go because my husband is a fan, personally I'd prefer to try a different BBQ joint. The experience may vary depending on your menu choices.", "I was surprised to find that the TV shows in my room were available for a fee of $4.99, and they included commercials. While I understand that hotels need to generate revenue, I felt that this approach was a bit unconventional. Additionally, I was disappointed to discover that breakfast was not included in the room rate, unlike many other hotels I've stayed at, including some more budget-friendly options in California. Instead, there was a buffet available for an extra charge.", "I highly recommend this shop, conveniently located near my hotel. The staff were exceptionally friendly and welcoming. The buy one get one deal is a fantastic offer that's hard to resist. I also tried their hot wings, which were delicious and generously sauced. I'll definitely be back for more pizza on my next visit to town!", "I'm obsessed with the cannolis at Termini Bros! They're made to order, so you know they're always fresh and delicious. The filling is absolutely amazing - it's got just the right amount of sweetness. Whether you're a cannoli lover or not, you've got to try one from Termini Bros. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!", "During our RV travels, we made a stop in Granite City and had the pleasure of discovering a charming caf\u00e9. Upon entering the establishment, we were warmly greeted by the friendly and courteous staff. The cuisine served was reminiscent of homemade cooking, and we were impressed by the freshness and flavor of our meals. We were so pleased with our experience that we returned for a second visit, and our food choices on both occasions were consistently delicious and comparable to a home-cooked meal.", "After spending three weeks exploring the local dining scene, I'm thrilled to have discovered a hidden gem off Magazine Street that lives up to its promise. The staff are warm and welcoming, and as a self-proclaimed Ph\u00f2 enthusiast, I can confidently say that their version is exceptional and definitely worth trying!", "We returned for breakfast and again, the food and service were impeccable. Highly recommend!", "Our kayaking tour on Santa Cruz Island was a huge success. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, thanks in large part to our excellent tour guide, Jen, who was both helpful and knowledgeable. The highlight of the tour was undoubtedly exploring the caves, which was an absolute blast. Despite having modest expectations, we were pleasantly surprised to find that the tour far exceeded them.", "Looking for a tasty meal that won't break the bank? You've got to try this place! The shrimp and goat cheese crepes are a game-changer - don't miss out!", "Get ready for a game-changing experience in the STL area! I'm embarrassed to admit that it took me over 10 years to discover this St. Louis staple, but now I'm hooked! This incredible destination is a must-visit for anyone looking for a unique adventure. Take a tour of the factory (Friday-Sunday, noon-5pm on the hour), explore the shop, bar, and dining area, and enjoy live music on the weekends. And don't worry about waiting - it's the perfect opportunity to soak up the atmosphere!\n\nThe beer? Absolutely phenomenal! As a non-beer enthusiast, I was blown away by the Hefeweizen - a perfect introduction for anyone looking to dip their toes into the world of craft brews. And the food? Homegrown and mouth-wateringly delicious! I devoured the pizza (a server recommendation) and my date raved about the bison burger.\n\nWhat really sets this place apart is the exceptional service and commitment to local quality. The staff is a talented team of free-spirited individuals who add to the venue's eclectic charm. Yes, it may be a bit pricier, but trust me, it's worth every penny. I'll be back again and again, and you should join me! Don't miss out on this STL tradition - get ready to experience the best!", "I'm extremely dissatisfied with my recent experience and would give it a zero rating if possible. I ordered a simple hamburger, but when I took two bites, I discovered it contained bacon, which I'm severely allergic to. I returned to the drive-through window to complain, but the staff member took the burger back without a word and disappeared. After an awkward two-minute wait, he returned and brusquely told me to go inside to collect my food. I did so, but still didn't receive an apology. This ordeal has left a bad taste in my mouth, and I won't be returning to this establishment. It's a shame, as it's convenient to have multiple dining options after DT. I guess I'll be sticking to Freebirds from now on!", "I'm very happy with my first visit. The car wash was great and the service was excellent. Thanks!", "I've been going to Sushi Nara since it opened this month and I'm a big fan. The restaurant is clean, the staff is friendly and accommodating, and the service is quick. The sushi is consistently delicious (I've been three times) and reasonably priced. In fact, my husband recently got takeout and paid only $24 for four sushi rolls. I appreciate the freshness of the food and the wide variety of options. If you're on the eastside, I highly recommend checking out Sushi Nara!", "Discover a hidden gem! This incredible shop is a treasure trove of hard-to-find tires and parts, curated by a passionate owner who's dedicated to his craft. With his expert knowledge and enthusiasm, you'll feel confident that you're in good hands. A must-visit for anyone seeking unique automotive solutions!", "I've had the pleasure of dining here numerous times, and my consistent verdict is that the cuisine is exceptional. Tucked away in Florissant, this eatery is a treasure trove, boasting the most delectable Panang curry in the area. Although I've yet to try their sister restaurant, I find myself reluctant to venture elsewhere, as the food here always leaves me thoroughly content and eager to return.", "While my recent dining experience didn't quite live up to my expectations, I'm willing to give this restaurant the benefit of the doubt - and an extra star - because I'm genuinely excited about their innovative menu and stylish concept. Unfortunately, my tomato-basil soup fell flat, tasting more like a bland marinara, and the tuna melt sandwich was overpowered by an intense citrus flavor that didn't quite work. However, I'm eager to give them another chance, particularly with their dishes featuring cured Italian meats like mortadella and prosciutto, which I'm confident will showcase their culinary skills. And let's not forget their tantalizing baked goods, especially the Nutella bruschetta - a must-try on my next visit!", "Underwhelming Experience: A Taste Bud Letdown! \n\nOur first and only visit to this eatery left us feeling disappointed and uninspired. The veggie pizza I ordered was a major letdown, with a lackluster tomato sauce that failed to impress and a measly amount of cheese that left me craving more. To make matters worse, the dough tasted like it was mass-produced by a machine, lacking that personal touch. While it's possible they've upped their game since our visit, we're not exactly champing at the bit to give them a second chance.", "So, a few friends and I decided to grab some late-night milkshakes and ended up at More Than Just Ice Cream. Yeah, we pretty much just got ice cream... didn't exactly live up to the name, but maybe next time, right? We got three milkshakes: coffee, chocolate, and black & white malt. They were all pretty solid. Definitely hit the spot for our ice cream cravings. I thought my coffee milkshake could've been thicker, and same with the chocolate. But the black & white was super thick and probably the winner of the three. Bummer I didn't order that one, so I was stuck with my not-so-creamy coffee. Before settling on a milkshake, I did try some of their ice cream flavors. The pumpkin pie was insane! I have no idea why I didn't just go with that. Maybe milkshakes aren't the way to go at this place...", "Celebrating a Century of Love: A Birthday to Remember!\n\nI still get goosebumps thinking about my husband and I taking my mom to this amazing spot for her 100th birthday! We were blown away by the exceptional treatment we received. From scoring a fantastic table with a stunning view, to savoring the chef's thoughtful complimentary dishes, to being wowed by the beautifully decorated cake plate - every detail exceeded our expectations. The warm and attentive servers made us feel like royalty. This unforgettable experience will be etched in our hearts forever, making my mom's milestone birthday truly unforgettable.", "I'm seriously impressed with this spot! The bartender was super friendly and knowledgeable. You gotta try the burger - it's made with fresh, locally-sourced ingredients and it's a game-changer. I saw some of the other dishes coming out of the kitchen and they looked incredible too. Plus, the beer is always ice-cold and the cocktails are expertly mixed. What I love most about this place is that it's a genuine local joint, not some chain restaurant. The staff is top-notch and you can tell they really care about what they're doing.", "I ended up visiting this restaurant four times during my five-day stay, which is a lot! Here's why I kept going back:\n\n* The restaurant was conveniently located near my hotel.\n* It had flexible hours, even on New Year's Day, which fit my schedule.\n* As a party of two, we were usually seated right away.\n* The price of $9 per dozen oysters was a great deal.\n* The adjacent seafood shop sold boiled and fresh seafood to-go.\n* Our server was friendly and recognized us every time we visited.\n\nHowever, I only gave the restaurant 3 stars because of some drawbacks:\n\n* Most of the dishes we tried were just average.\n* The raw oysters weren't cleaned well, so I'd recommend Superior Seafood's happy hour deal for better quality and cheaper oysters.\n* The turtle soup had a strange taste, and I prefer Felix's version.\n* Some of my boiled shrimp were mushy, possibly due to overcooking.\n* While the ambiance was inviting, it wasn't very comfortable, so we usually just ate and left.\n* The bathroom could use a good cleaning!\n\nDespite these issues, I might visit again if I'm in the area or need to grab some seafood quickly.", "Avoid this restaurant at all costs if you're looking for a decent dinner experience. Our server was completely incompetent, often leaving us wondering if she was even familiar with the layout of the restaurant. We had to repeatedly ask for basic necessities like utensils and water refills. To make matters worse, I ordered chicken parmesan but was served eggplant parmesan instead, which contained a fish bone. The only redeeming quality was the drinks, which were satisfactory.", "My experience at TDS was underwhelming, to say the least. The restaurant's ambiance was lacking, with no decorative touches, menu boards, or even proper dining tables - just stainless steel prep tables. The staff, though numerous, wore no identifying uniforms or name tags, adding to the impersonal atmosphere. While the food was reasonably priced and mostly enjoyable, the real disappointment came when we were charged extra for salsa. We had ordered a salsa trio, which included three small samples, and when my brother asked for more to accompany his tacos, we were told we'd have to purchase the trio again. This was particularly frustrating given our substantial order of tacos, burritos, guacamole, and drinks, totaling over $40. Despite the decent food, the lackluster atmosphere and nickel-and-diming over salsa make it unlikely that I'll return.", "I'm absolutely thrilled with our photos! We've had the pleasure of working with Angela Clifton Photography three times, and every single image has exceeded our expectations. Not only are the photos stunning, but we've also had an amazing time during each shoot. What's more, the prices are incredibly affordable, making the beautiful memories we've captured a treasured keepsake for years to come.", "I had a pleasant dining experience at a sidewalk table, savoring my fish dish. Although the prices were a bit steep, the food was delicious. If you're looking for a quieter outdoor dining spot in the French Quarter, I recommend checking out Side Street instead.", "The historic courthouse is a must-visit, boasting impressive artwork throughout its premises. One of its unique features is the spiral staircase, which adds a touch of whimsy to the building's architecture. From the 5th level, visitors can enjoy a panoramic view of the entire city. The tower clock room is a particular highlight, featuring an intricate system of mechanical gears that is truly astonishing. Note that prior appointment is required to access the clock room. With so much to explore, plan to spend at least 2-3 hours here to make the most of your visit.", "I had the pleasure of meeting Ann today, and I was thoroughly impressed. Not only was she extremely helpful and radiated positivity, but she also went above and beyond to ensure my first experience was exceptional. Her outstanding service has earned my loyalty, and I'll definitely be a regular customer from now on. Thank you, Ann!", "I just had the most amazing dining experience at this hidden gem! It was my first time trying it out, and I was blown away by the flavors and atmosphere. The combination dinner was a game-changer - the pad Thai was everything I dreamed it would be, and the coconut soup was a revelation! I'd never had it before, but now I'm hooked. The restaurant itself was a feast for the eyes, with stunning Thai decor and music that transported me to the streets of Bangkok. And the service? Absolutely top-notch! In a town with limited dining options, this place is a breath of fresh air. I've found my new go-to spot in Carp - can't wait to come back!", "I stumbled upon a hidden gem that instantly melted all my stress away! This laid-back haven is definitely earning a spot on my must-visit-again list. And the cherry on top? The talented artist who took the stage, serving up a refreshing blend of eclectic tunes - including a country twist on 'Let It Go' that left me grinning from ear to ear. What's not to adore about this place?", "Get ready for a jaw-dropping transformation! If you haven't visited the Smoothie King Center since its New Orleans Arena days, you're in for a thrilling surprise. This iconic venue has undergone a stunning makeover, and while the seats remain the same, everything else has been revitalized to impress. The real showstopper? A mouth-watering array of food options to tantalize every taste bud. Savor the significant upgrade in quality, a far cry from just a few years ago. Quench your thirst with an impressive selection of drinks, including full-service bars, spiked lemonade, bottled and draft beer, and of course, signature smoothies. Indulge your sweet tooth at the dedicated dessert spot, featuring irresistible treats like funnel cake and cotton candy. The Smoothie King Center has finally reached new heights of luxury and sophistication. We've truly 'moved on up' to a whole new level of entertainment excellence!", "When I'm feeling unwell, Chipotle is my go-to fix. I avoid lunchtime crowds and visit between 2-4 pm for a peaceful experience. The service is always friendly and fast, regardless of the crowd.", "I was pleasantly surprised by this Indian restaurant in Tampa Bay, which exceeded my expectations in every way. The ambiance was lovely, complete with white table linens, and the food was truly exceptional. The chicken 65 was outstanding, and the hot sour soup was rich and full of flavor. Our waitress, Angel, provided friendly, attentive, and pleasant service. Despite only being open for a week, I'm confident that this restaurant will soon become a go-to destination for foodies seeking authentic Indian cuisine.", "It took me three trips to New Orleans to finally experience the magic of this iconic jazz venue. After waiting in line twice before, I learned my lesson and splurged on reserved seats this time around. The extra $20 was well worth it, as it allowed us to bypass the hour-long wait and support the preservation of jazz - a great cause. The show was absolutely fantastic, featuring talented musicians with great personalities. It felt like stepping back in time to the concerts of 50 years ago. The band members were stylish, engaging, and incredibly skilled. The intimate setting, which holds only around 200 people, added to the charm, allowing us to see the joy on the musicians' faces as they shared their craft with us. This is a must-do experience while in NOLA - don't hesitate to splurge and make it happen!", "WOW, What a Refreshing Experience!\n\nAs a new customer, I was blown away by the exceptional service I received at Keystone Discount Tire. With my original plans rained out and my dealership too busy to accommodate me, I was in a bind. But Keystone came to the rescue, fitting me in without an appointment and delivering a hassle-free PA State & Emissions inspection.\n\nI was a bit apprehensive, having heard horror stories about shady shops tacking on unnecessary extras. But Keystone's stellar Yelp reviews gave me confidence. And boy, was I impressed! While I sipped on a complimentary cup of coffee, their team worked efficiently to inspect my 2008 Pontiac Torrent.\n\nThe only time I was asked to intervene was to take a look at some minor outer front tire wear, which Bill, the friendly and knowledgeable technician, pointed out to me during the inspection. I appreciated his transparency and honesty - it was a simple issue that could be easily addressed with an alignment in the future.\n\nThe best part? My car was fully inspected and stickered in under an hour, without any surprise add-ons or inflated costs. Bill's straightforward analysis and friendly demeanor made the entire experience a breeze.\n\nIf you're looking for a trustworthy and customer-centric shop, look no further than Keystone Discount Tire. And don't forget to sign up for their mailing list to snag some amazing coupons!", "I'm still in awe - my son's phone was revived in under 30 minutes after a devastating drop! The expert technicians worked their magic with ease, providing top-notch service that left me beaming with delight.", "I was extremely disappointed with the service and management at this Cracker Barrel location. Despite messing up all four of our orders, the waiter became defensive and used inappropriate language when we brought it to his attention. The manager offered to comp our drinks, but it was too little, too late. The food was cold and unappetizing, and we ended up not finishing our meals after waiting over an hour for them to arrive. Unfortunately, this experience has left a bad taste in my mouth, and I will not be dining at Cracker Barrel again in the future.", "I've stayed at several dog-friendly hotels outside of the city, but I wasn't sure what to expect from one in the heart of the city. Typically, they're more like motels. As I walked into the Loews hotel lobby with my labrador/golden mix, Bentley, I felt a bit apprehensive - she's not exactly easy to hide. My boyfriend had assured me it was dog-friendly, but I was still uneasy as we approached the front desk to register.\n\nHowever, the receptionist immediately put us at ease with her warm welcome. As we checked in, an attendant even offered Bentley treats, which she thoroughly enjoyed. The receptionist also asked if we'd like a welcome kit for her, which included dog dishes, a mat, treats, and more. I was blown away by the thoughtfulness.\n\nThe other guests at the hotel were equally enthusiastic, stopping to compliment and pet \"queen Bentley\" as we made our way to our top-floor room. Even the car attendants greeted her by name when I took her for a walk. We were so impressed with the exceptional service that we decided to extend our stay an extra night. Thank you, Loews, for showing me that a hotel can truly be dog-friendly, even for a big dog like Bentley.", "I've had mixed experiences with this food. While it can be exceptional, the quality is inconsistent. I've been ordering the same dish for years, and it's a coin toss whether it will be incredible or not. It's as if they have different chefs in the kitchen, making it unpredictable. Unfortunately, it's only excellent about 50% of the time, which is frustrating.", "I've had the misfortune of visiting this location twice, and I can confidently say I will not be returning. My first experience was mediocre, but my second visit was utterly disappointing. I ordered ribs, which I had to send back not once, but twice, due to inconsistent temperatures. The first time, one half was warm and the other half was refrigerator cold. The second time, one side was scorching hot and the other side remained cold. It wasn't until the third attempt that my meal was finally edible. The manager did apologize, but failed to offer any compensation for the inconvenience. While I'm not one to make a scene in hopes of getting something for free, I was taken aback by the lack of sincerity in their apology. After having to send my food back three times just to get it cooked properly, I felt compelled to share my disappointing experience in this review.", "Ramen Rendezvous: A Tale of Two Tastes\n\nAfter indulging in a ramen revelry at various hotspots, I landed at Cheu with sky-high expectations. Alas, my bowl didn't quite live up to the hype. The thick, chunky noodles and salty broth just didn't harmonize with my taste buds. But, as they say, 'to each their own' - my friend, a Cheu regular, was absolutely smitten!\n\nThe silver lining? Exceptional service and a craft beer selection that's sure to please even the most discerning palates. Perhaps I'm just a ramen rebel, but I'm eager for others to form their own opinions. Who knows, you might just find your new favorite haunt!", "Two new concessions have been added to the ballpark. Federal Doughnuts offers doughnuts and fried chicken. Additionally, a gluten-free concession stand near section 136 is now available, serving pizza, cheesesteaks, brownies, and cookies.", "I'm thrilled to discover a new Red Kings restaurant in Chinatown, which has just opened its doors yesterday! It's unclear whether this location is replacing the existing one down the street or if it's an additional outlet serving up more of their signature spicy Szechuan cuisine. I opted for takeout and tried the Dan Dan Noodles and shredded Pork in Garlic sauce, both of which boasted a perfect balance of heat and flavor. The spice level was intense, but complemented by sweet, earthy, and fresh notes. The generous portions will provide plenty of leftovers, and I'm eager to explore more of the menu and return for a sit-down dinner. As an added bonus, the restaurant features karaoke rooms upstairs and allows BYOB (bring your own bottle).", "I've never seen a Chick-fil-A as slammed as this one, but somehow they always manage to crank out orders at lightning speed while still delivering top-notch service. I'm seriously blown away by how they can consistently pull it off! This place has definitely earned a spot as one of my all-time faves.", "This charming eatery is a haven for salad lovers! Whenever I'm in town, I make it a point to stop by for a delightful lunch. The service is impressively swift, and the vibrant veggies are always bursting with freshness.", "On September 26th, 2015, my parents and I embarked on an unforgettable adventure with the Oak Alley and Laura Plantation tour. Our knowledgeable driver, whose expertise added depth to our journey, transported us to these historic gems. The meticulously planned schedule allowed for the perfect balance of guided exploration and free time to wander the stunning properties at our own pace. Plus, the flexible drop-off locations on the return drive were a bonus, enabling us to disembark near Jackson Square and indulge in the vibrant atmosphere of the French Quarter for the rest of the afternoon.", "Brunch lovers, rejoice! We've had the pleasure of dining at this gem not once, but twice, and each experience has been an absolute delight! Every dish we've tried has been a flavor sensation, with the creamy grits infused with scallions and sour cream being a standout star. But, be warned: the room can get chilly, so don't forget to bundle up with a cozy sweater to ensure a comfortable and enjoyable meal!", "I highly recommend this establishment for its exceptional hot dogs and chili dogs, which are unparalleled in the area. I'm a frequent customer and always look forward to savoring their delicious offerings.", "Discover the Ultimate Hangout Spot at the Waterline! I recently spent a Saturday evening here with friends, grooving to live music and savoring the best local beer in town - hands down! The vibe is a cut above Fig Mountain, and I'm obsessed with Topa's unique charm. But what really takes it to the next level is the seamless experience with the Nook Restaurant and Lama Dog, just steps away. Imagine indulging in mouth-watering eats and then strolling into a trendy taproom - it's a game-changer! I'm hooked on the Waterline and can't wait to go back!", "I am delighted to report that our experience with this company's customer service was exceptional. Although our location was slightly outside their designated pickup area, they were more than willing to accommodate our group of seven and arranged for transportation to their facility. Upon arrival, we discovered an error on our invoice, as we were charged for eight individuals instead of seven. I promptly contacted their customer service department, and they rectified the issue by refunding the excess amount in a timely manner. The tour itself was an absolute delight! Our group thoroughly enjoyed the experience, thanks in large part to our humorous and engaging tour guide. We had the opportunity to observe numerous alligators, ranging from infant specimens swimming in the water to fully grown adults. Additionally, we spotted turtles and various bird species during the tour. A highlight of the experience was the chance to hold a baby alligator, which our guide is currently caring for until it reaches a suitable size for release. The return journey was equally enjoyable, as our guide operated the boat at a thrilling pace and even performed some impressive maneuvers. I highly recommend this tour to anyone seeking a fun and memorable experience.", "In April, Westfall expertly replaced our roof, and we couldn't be more thrilled with the entire experience. From the high-quality roof they installed to their exceptional communication and diligent follow-up, every aspect of the process exceeded our expectations. We're absolutely delighted that we chose Westfall for the job!", "This establishment offers delectable cuisine at a moderate price point, complemented by a courteous and attentive staff. While the dining area may not be conducive to a leisurely meal, it's understandable given their focus on providing quick, high-quality vegan options. Although the buffalo bella is heavily promoted, I personally recommend the Cheesesteak, which is a standout dish in my opinion. Additionally, I would suggest augmenting your meal with an order of sweet potato fries - a delightful accompaniment that elevates the overall dining experience.", "The ramen at this establishment is satisfactory, although it does not exceed expectations. The service is also adequate. While it may not be a top choice, it is a convenient option for a quick meal. Having visited this location twice, I intend to continue patronizing it in the future.", "A culinary experience that caters to diverse palates! This eatery boasts a clean, trendy ambiance and serves delectable dishes that are sure to delight. To avoid lengthy wait times, I recommend arriving prior to 9 am, as the crowds tend to swell thereafter. However, I assure you that the wait is well worth it. You'll depart feeling utterly satiated and thoroughly impressed.", "I highly recommend the $9.99 brisket sandwich meal, which comes with two sides and a drink. The barbecue is great and the price is unbeatable. The side options are delicious, including potato casserole, creamed spinach, baked beans, and green beans.", "The restaurant exceeded my expectations with its delicious food and excellent service. However, I would have liked to see more vegetarian and vegan options on the menu. Despite this, I'm already looking forward to my next visit!", "The restaurant serves excellent cuisine, but unfortunately, the customer service is subpar. After visiting three times, I've had the misfortune of being served by two unfriendly older waitresses. However, the owner is a bright spot, being very kind and welcoming.", "Discovery of the Day: Nashville's Hidden Breakfast Gem!\n\nAs I soared through the skies en route to Music City, a chance conversation with a Franklin local led me to a game-changing breakfast spot. His enthusiastic recommendation to brave the line was all I needed to convince me to give it a try. And, oh boy, am I glad I did!\n\nNot only did we dodge the crowds, but our waitress revealed we'd lucked out by missing the morning rush. The real magic happened when my plate arrived, featuring a show-stopping corn pancake loaded with crispy bacon, zesty salsa, and a dollop of creamy sour cream. It was love at first bite!\n\nThis Nashville gem has earned a permanent spot on my Southern itinerary. If you're a breakfast aficionado like me, do yourself a favor and add it to your must-try list. Trust me, you won't regret it!", "I'm still in shock about our recent experience with a detailing service! My husband and I were really looking forward to getting our car detailed, so he booked an appointment with Michael for the following Saturday. To confirm, he even called again on Friday to make sure everything was set. But when we arrived at the workshop the next day, we were surprised to find out that Michael didn't have us down for a full detailing service, even though we had specifically discussed it. He suggested we come back the following Saturday instead, so we agreed.\n\nWe arrived bright and early at 8am the next week, but to our surprise, the workshop was closed! We tried calling Michael, but he said he was busy and would call us back. We waited for half an hour, but there was no call. We decided to grab some breakfast and came back at 9:30am, hoping to give him another chance. That's when Alex, his partner, finally opened the shop. Unfortunately, Michael was still nowhere to be found, and Alex couldn't reach him either. We were really disappointed and decided to cancel our appointment. It was a frustrating experience, but we're hoping to find a better service elsewhere.", "I recently had a complex relocation experience that necessitated additional support from this office. I was impressed by the exceptional service provided by the team, who demonstrated a high level of professionalism and integrity. They went to great lengths to ensure my needs were met, and I am grateful for their dedication. I would highly recommend this office to anyone, including family and friends, and have the utmost confidence in their ability to deliver outstanding results.", "During our girls' getaway to New Orleans last year, we had the pleasure of staying at The Saint, a hotel that initially impressed us with its stunning lobby, trendy bar, and restaurant that exuded a sophisticated ambiance. The warm and inviting atmosphere, coupled with the friendly staff, set the tone for what promised to be an unforgettable weekend. I arrived a few hours prior to my friend's arrival, as I had a substantial amount of work to attend to. I settled into my room, ordered room service, and spent the next four hours productively working on my laptop. After completing my tasks, I took a break to purchase a bottle of wine and treat myself to a manicure and pedicure. Upon my friend's arrival, we were ready to take on the city, and our evening began with a delightful dinner outing. However, our merriment was short-lived, as we soon discovered a massive flying cockroach in our room. I was horrified and promptly marched down to the front desk to report the issue. The staff assured me that they would send a maintenance worker to address the problem, but I was adamant that this was not a sufficient solution, as I suspected that there might be other unwanted critters lurking in the shadows. To my dismay, the new room they provided was also infested with small spiders and dead insects in the window corners, and to make matters worse, the TV was malfunctioning, and one of the lamps was without bulbs. It was now around 3 am, and I had reached my breaking point. I promptly booked a room at my trusted go-to hotel, The W, for the remainder of our trip. The next morning, I demanded to speak with a manager, and a young gentleman apologized for the inconvenience. I thanked him for his apology and requested a full refund, which he graciously provided. He also extended an invitation for us to return to The Saint once they had implemented changes, but I politely declined, still shaken by our unpleasant experience.", "Need a new door but only have $35 to spare? Look no further than the Green Project! This treasure trove of reclaimed materials has got you covered. And what about all those leftover building supplies, random lumber, roofing materials, and paint taking up space in your garage or basement? Instead of sending them to the landfill, bring them to the Green Project, where they can be repurposed and given new life. By choosing the Green Project, you'll not only reduce waste but also support a more sustainable future.", "I was really disappointed with my experience at this spot. The bouncer could've been more welcoming, and it felt like they were taking advantage of their Broadway location to overcharge and treat customers poorly. As a local, I was expecting more. Unfortunately, I won't be back and wouldn't recommend it to others.", "Wow, what a lunchtime treat! My girlfriend and I dropped by for a bite, and we were blown away by the sparkling cleanliness of the place. But the real star of the show was the food - absolutely phenomenal! And the best part? It won't break the bank! We can't wait to go back and indulge in another delicious meal!", "I've been a loyal customer for years, but my recent visit was a letdown. The food quality has taken a noticeable dip. We started with an artichoke that seemed to have been prepared ahead of time, which resulted in a cold center despite being cooked through. The Greek salad my wife ordered was also a miss, with pre-packaged ingredients and an overabundance of flavorless dressing. Unfortunately, my grilled yellowtail was the biggest disappointment - it was overcooked and tasted like low-quality frozen fish, which is unacceptable for a restaurant of this caliber. While the setting and service were still pleasant, the subpar food overshadowed the positives. I hope the kitchen can revamp their dishes to restore this establishment to its former glory. With a little improvement, it could regain its status as a local gem.", "Ready to shake up your brunch game? Look no further than Milktooth! This Indy hotspot serves up creative breakfast cocktails and twists on classic brunch dishes that will make your taste buds do the happy dance. Don't be intimidated if you don't recognize some of the menu items - trust us, you'll love whatever you order!\n\nBe prepared for a short wait (about 30 minutes on weekends), but don't worry, you can grab a coffee or pastry at their walk-up bar to hold you over. It's the perfect sneak peek at the deliciousness to come!\n\nMilktooth's menu is always evolving, but some fan favorites stay put, with seasonal ingredient swaps to keep things fresh. Their Dutch pancake variations are a must-try, and the raclette grilled cheese is absolute perfection. If you're feeling extra festive, don't miss the michelada - and if the weather's nice, snag a seat outside to soak up the sunshine!", "We recently stayed at this hotel and had a fantastic experience, thanks to the amazing bar and staff! As a special touch, we were upgraded to a room with a stunning view since we were celebrating our honeymoon. However, despite the lovely view, the room itself was nothing out of the ordinary - comparable to a Hilton. We did notice some rust on the tub floor and strange stains on the tile, but these issues were limited to the bathroom.\n\nDespite these minor flaws, I'd still give the hotel 4 stars due to the exceptional staff. One thing to note is that the valet parking was a bit pricey, so we opted to park a couple of streets down instead. If you're looking to stay in the heart of downtown St. Louis, surrounded by cool bars and restaurants, I'd definitely recommend this hotel. Friday nights are especially lively in the area!", "Discovering a Hidden Gem: My Uplifting Experience at the Studio!\n\nI stepped into the beginner's class at this studio, and it was love at first move! The pace was spot on, challenging me just enough to uncover hidden flexibility in unexpected places. I was thrilled to find myself breaking a sweat, and the rush of endorphins left me feeling amazing afterwards. The cherry on top? The studio's sparkling cleanliness and the convenient option to grab some healthy Beyond Organic goodies on my way out.", "We finally found this great place! We were going to go to a chain lobster restaurant, but we wanted something more real and local. A friend told us about Lobster Haven, so I checked it online. It looked like the kind of place we like to eat at when we visit our family in Massachusetts. We loved it! The service was great, fast, and super friendly. They had a huge selection of all our favorite seafood dishes. If you want real New England seafood, you have to try this place! Plus, you can even buy live lobsters and fresh seafood to take home and cook yourself.", "I'm thoroughly impressed with this establishment! They offer an exceptional happy hour experience, a constantly updated menu featuring fresh and exciting options, and their craft drinks are truly delicious. If I had the opportunity, I would make it a point to visit this place daily, it's that good!", "I'm obsessed with Men's Clubs - it's the ultimate game-changer! Every single barber is a master of their craft, guaranteed to leave you looking and feeling like a million bucks. I've been a loyal customer for three years now, and I've never had a single complaint. Okay, okay, there was that one time when some shady character tried to rip off my signature style. But Tim, the hero of the hour, shut it down with a refreshing dose of honesty: \"Sorry, buddy, I can't replicate Ryan's magic.\" Thanks, Tim, for keeping it real and keeping my hair on point!", "My husband and I are regulars here, and for good reason. The food is consistently fresh and expertly prepared, and the service is always top-notch. If you're a sushi and hibachi lover like us, we can't recommend this place enough - it's a must-try!", "Chickie's and Pete's is the ultimate spot to catch a game and indulge in delicious food and drinks. While the cuisine may not be the best I've ever had, the overall experience is unbeatable. If you can snag a seat, be sure to order the mussels red, crab fries, and a cold beer - it's a winning combination. My personal favorites include the crab fries, mussels red (the white variety can be overpowering with garlic), spicy pull and peel shrimp, steamers, and blue crabs (if you're up for the challenge). I appreciate how the restaurant makes it easy to get messy and enjoy your food without worrying about the aftermath, thanks to the conveniently located sinks.\n\nIn short, Chickie's and Pete's is a beloved Philadelphia institution that guarantees a good time. I highly recommend visiting at least once to experience it for yourself. Just keep in mind two important things before heading there during major sporting events: be prepared to wait for a table, and be tolerant of the lively (and sometimes rowdy) atmosphere. Trust me, I've been there too - and it's all part of the fun!", "I received prompt and professional service on a Saturday, which was impressive. The task was a simple mirror repair, but the team made it a seamless experience for me. I've had the pleasure of using their services in Charlotte before, and they consistently deliver great results.", "I recently dined at Union Station in St. Louis and had a positive experience. I opted for the Ponchartrain, which my server informed me was identical to Tilapia, despite both options being listed on the menu - a curious decision. The dish itself was delicious, featuring mushrooms and a rich cream sauce. We also ordered the shrimp cocktail and lump crab cake appetizers, which were decent but not exceptional. The drinks and service were satisfactory. We took advantage of the pleasant weather and dined on the patio, but the interior of the restaurant looked cozy and slightly more formal.", "I recently visited this trendy spot for a drink and was blown away by the ambiance. The concept is truly one-of-a-kind in St. Pete, and the attention to detail in the remodel is impressive. You'll feel like you're stepping into a scene from a fantasy novel, complete with subtle background music that allows for easy conversation. The bartenders, Michael and Peggy, were warm and engaging, making the experience even more enjoyable. Although I didn't try the food this time, the prices for their meat and cheese trays seem very reasonable compared to similar establishments in the area. I'm looking forward to returning to try their menu and would highly recommend this spot to anyone looking for a unique and welcoming atmosphere.", "I'm absolutely thrilled with Maple Street Patisserie! This bakery has never failed to impress me. In fact, their blueberry muffin is the best I've ever had the pleasure of trying. Whether you're in the mood for a delicious breakfast or lunch, this spot is a must-visit. Plus, they offer specialty cakes, including king cakes during Mardi Gras season. What really sets them apart, though, is the owner, Ziggy, who works tirelessly to create these mouthwatering treats. His dedication is truly admirable. Overall, I highly recommend Maple Street Patisserie - you won't be disappointed!", "I enjoyed the Bourbon Black and Bleu burger, cooked to my liking and very flavorful. However, our large party of 9 had to wait over an hour for our food, which was unacceptable. Despite this, I'd recommend the burger, but they need to improve their service speed.", "Whenever we have visitors from out of town, we always take them to Katie's. The food is amazing and there's a lot to choose from. Plus, it's affordable and delicious! You can't go wrong with their grilled oysters, shrimp and grits, Cuban sandwich, pizza, or soup and salad. They also have daily specials that feature local and seasonal ingredients. The staff is friendly and welcoming. Just be aware that Sundays can get busy after church, but you can always grab a drink and enjoy their bottomless Mimosas while you wait!", "After attending the Zurich Classic golf tournament, I stopped by Creole Creamery for a refreshing treat. The warm and humid weather made an ice cream cone the perfect choice. I was lucky to find street parking and was impressed by the cozy interior. The massive flavor selection was overwhelming, but after trying a few unique options, I opted for a scoop of cookie monster ice cream on a cone. The ice cream was a hit - not too sweet and totally satisfying. I highly recommend checking out Creole Creamery!", "I'm absolutely obsessed with this place! As a regular customer for the past few years, I can confidently say it's a hidden gem. While it may not be the most conventional spot, with a quirky atmosphere that might not appeal to everyone, it truly shines when it comes to its extensive Saki selection, mouth-watering rolls, and generous portions of rice and Sashimi. The vibrant, youthful energy is palpable, with loud dance music setting the tone for a lively night out. If you're a Saki enthusiast like myself, this is the ultimate destination!", "We highly recommend this place - every dish we've tried has been a hit! The Backyard Bowl is our top pick so far, but we're excited to try more. The portions are generous, and we're always satisfied with a kids' size or a shared large. The high-quality ingredients make for filling meals at a reasonable price. Be prepared for a wait, especially during peak hours, but trust us, it's worth it.", "The service was a bit unusual, as our server was new to the job. However, the food presentation was a highlight - it looked great. One area for improvement was the gumbo, which could have used either a side of rice or a more generous serving of potato salad. On a separate note, the Sprite I ordered was flat, but fortunately, I didn't end up needing it anyway.", "This pancake spot is a solid choice, but it can get a bit chaotic when it's slammed with customers. The pancakes themselves are tasty, but be prepared for a sugar rush - they're extremely sweet. On the plus side, the prices are reasonable. One major advantage is that they serve breakfast all day, which is a definite perk. However, there's nothing particularly unique or standout about the menu that you can't find elsewhere.", "Discovering hidden gems has never been so exciting! The amazing staff made our shopping experience truly unforgettable. We can't wait to come back and uncover more treasures!", "I've been a loyal customer since childhood, and now I'm proud to bring my own kids here. The staff has been like family, watching us grow up over the years. They're not only friendly and personable but also incredibly efficient with their service. Special shoutout to Yoli and Frank - they're the epitome of excellence! The food is simply amazing, with the shredded beef burro and cheese crisp being my absolute favorites. In my opinion, this place serves up genuinely authentic Mexican cuisine.", "I would give this restaurant 2 stars for dining in. The service was disappointing and the venue was subpar. The food was average, but if I had gotten takeout, I might have given it 3 stars. I ordered the lamb kebab, which was just okay. It was very plain, with no sauces, lettuce, or other toppings - just the meat.", "This Middle Eastern restaurant is a standout in the area, consistently serving exceptional cuisine that never fails to impress. The quality of their dishes is unparalleled, and I always leave feeling satisfied and delighted.", "I am astonished that anyone would rate this establishment with only one star. Allow me to share my experience. In my opinion, they offer the superior cannoli in the city. Termini's and Isgro's, while well-known, do not come close to matching the quality of Potito's. As a result, Potito's has become my go-to destination for cannoli, and I wouldn't consider visiting anywhere else. I make it a point to visit every Christmas Eve, and I intend to continue this tradition for years to come. This year, I waited in line for two hours at Isgro's for a tiramisu, whereas I was able to walk into Potito's and promptly purchase my preferred Bambino cannoli stuffed cannoli. I assure you, it is every bit as delightful as it sounds.", "I'm absolutely thrilled to rave about this hidden gem of an eatery! As someone who grew up surrounded by authentic Mexican cuisine in the Texas panhandle, I've been on a lifelong quest to find restaurants that live up to my high standards. And let me tell you, El Limon is the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of Mexican restaurants in Pennsylvania! Their menu boasts an impressive array of mouthwatering dishes, from sopes and tostadas to enchiladas, fajitas, burritos, and fish tacos - each one expertly prepared and ridiculously affordable. The waitstaff is always warm, welcoming, and attentive, making every visit a true delight. But what truly sets El Limon apart are its two standout features: their heavenly homemade tamales and complimentary margaritas! Whether you're a foodie, a family, or just looking for a fantastic dining experience, El Limon is the perfect destination for an unforgettable Mexican feast. \u00a1Ol\u00e9!", "I'm awarding this establishment 4 stars, with the potential to reach 5-star excellence once they iron out a few wrinkles. As a frequent visitor to the area, I've had the opportunity to dine here multiple times, and I'm confident that the minor issues I've encountered will be resolved as they continue to refine their operations. The staff is more than willing to make amends when mistakes occur, which is a testament to their commitment to customer satisfaction.\n\nThe food, overall, is exceptional. While some reviewers have raved about the pizza, I found it to be somewhat lacking, with a greasy texture and a cheese blend that may not be 100% mozzarella. However, the other dishes I've tried have been outstanding:\n\n* The Quaker (chicken version) is a highlight, with chunky chicken, perfectly melted cheese, and fresh vegetables. A bit more seasoning on the chicken would elevate it to perfection.\n* The fries are crispy and flavorful, with no need for ketchup.\n* The onion rings are crispy and delicious, with a minimal amount of grease.\n* The spanakopita was slightly overcooked, but the flavors were excellent.\n* The baklava is a standout, with a perfect balance of sweet and savory.\n* The Signature Salad features incredibly fresh vegetables and a tangy balsamic dressing.\n* The (turkey) Greek Burger is one of the best I've ever had, with a moist and flavorful patty, topped with a delectable homemade tzatziki sauce. The fresh romaine lettuce and absence of feta were minor deviations from the menu, but the sauce more than made up for it.\n\nOverall, this establishment has tremendous potential and is already serving up high-quality dishes. If they maintain their standards, I'll be a regular customer.", "**Planet Fitness: A Great Value with 24/7 Access**\n\nPlanet Fitness stands out with its 24-hour operation, earning it a 4-star rating. If you're on a budget, it's the cheapest option that offers the best value for your money. For just $20.00 a month, you'll have access to a range of amenities, including tanning beds, massage chairs, and a sculpt machine.\n\n**Note:** The $9.99 membership option is available, but it comes with some limitations, such as no guest privileges.\n\nDespite the lack of motivation from bodybuilders, the gym is still a great choice. The staff is consistently polite and helpful, making it a welcoming environment for everyone.", "Extremely let down. We arrived at 2:15 pm on Saturday to grab a bite, only to be informed that the kitchen had already closed at 2 pm. This was a surprise, given their website explicitly states they're open all day on Saturdays and Sundays until 5 pm. I'm always skeptical of establishments that can't get basic details like their hours correct online. It raises concerns about their attention to quality and other important details.", "I'm super impressed with these guys! They're total pros - they get the job done on schedule and stand behind their work with a warranty. If you need something done, I'd definitely give them a shout!", "I'm hooked on this place! I make it a point to dine here at least twice a week, and every time I'm blown away by the exceptional service - the servers are always beaming with friendly smiles. The food? Absolutely incredible! I've never left feeling anything less than completely satisfied, with a full stomach and a heart full of joy.", "Hidden Gem Alert! We stumbled upon the transformed Carrow's Restaurant on Plumb and Kietzke, and it's a real treasure! This former gem was saved from demolition by its stunning redwood beams and fascia, and now it's serving up culinary masterpieces. The food was nothing short of phenomenal! My wife devoured the tri-tip salad, with its perfectly balanced balsamic vinaigrette, tender medium-rare tri-tip, and crispy potato \"croutons\" that added a delightful textural twist. I opted for the tri-tip, chicken, and combo, paired with the fresh corn salad and creamy potato salad - every bite was pure bliss! We were so impressed that we indulged in dessert, a rare treat for us. The lemon meringue pie stole the show, with its silky, golden-brown meringue that melted in our mouths. And the best part? The prices were incredibly reasonable for the exceptional quality and ambiance. We've already raved about it to our friends and family, and we can't wait to return for another unforgettable dining experience. Kudos to the chef and team - you've truly outdone yourselves!", "I didn't have the pleasure of having Rebecca as my doula during my birth, but I did have the privilege of having her as our nanny for our firstborn daughter. As she spent more time in our home, I looked forward to our conversations before and after work. As an expectant mom pregnant with my second child, I found her insights and suggestions to be incredibly valuable. Rebecca is not only easy to talk to, but also honest and truthful - a quality I truly appreciate. Her passion for her role as a doula shines through, and she has a deep respect for the strength and beauty of the labor process. I highly recommend having Rebecca on your support team - she would be a wonderful addition!", "I recently had my car tinted at Orange Tint and Tune and received exceptional service. The shop offers a convenient car pick-up service for customers within a 4-mile radius. My technician, Carlos, took the time to explain all the tint options and even adjusted the grade to achieve the look I wanted. The receptionist was friendly, and the owner, Dustin, followed up to ensure I was satisfied with the service. Overall, I highly recommend Orange Tint and Tune and give them 5 stars for their outstanding customer care.", "I stayed at this TownePlace Suites for three nights on business and had a pleasant experience. The hotel's proximity to the airport is convenient, yet surprisingly quiet. The rooms are standard TownePlace Suites fare, equipped with a refrigerator, stove, and other amenities. The surrounding area is quiet, with a mix of hotels and office buildings, and is about a 20-minute drive from downtown or the university area. The Pima Air Museum is just a 5-10 minute drive away. While dining options are limited, there are some fast food choices and a great sandwich shop called Baggins within walking distance. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful, and the breakfast offered a standard continental spread with a few hot options. They also host a weekday evening reception, which could be a decent substitute for dinner if you arrive early. My only suggestion for improvement is that they should restock the food and drinks more frequently during the reception, as options ran out quickly. Overall, the rooms are comfortable, the beds are cozy, and the area feels safe.", "Detour Delight: Discovering a Hidden Gem in Tampa!\n\nA unexpected diversion to Tampa turned into a culinary adventure when we stumbled upon a local treasure, thanks to Yelp's expert guidance. We dodged the chain restaurants and opted for an authentic experience, and boy, are we glad we did!\n\nThe ladies indulged in the tender 7 oz. Tampa strip, while the gentlemen devoured the massive 14 oz. ribeye. The real magic happened when we discovered they grill their steaks over oak and citrus wood, infusing them with a smoky flavor that's simply sublime! As fellow wood-smoke enthusiasts, we were thrilled to find a kindred spirit in this kitchen. It's a rare find, indeed, and well worth the detour!\n\nSides of fresh veggies and sweet potatoes complemented our meals perfectly. And the wine list? A refreshing surprise! Most bottles were under $20, with a thoughtful selection that didn't break the bank. No outrageous markups here!\n\nOur wonderful waitress, Lisa, offered spot-on recommendations and treated us to warm, friendly service that made us feel right at home. We're so grateful we took a chance on this local gem instead of settling for a chain. This hidden gem is now firmly bookmarked for our next Tampa visit. Don't miss out on this incredible find!", "After my initial review, the owner of this location (who also owns two other locations, including one in Southampton) personally reached out to me. We had a lengthy conversation that lasted about 30 minutes, and I was thoroughly impressed by his business approach. He's exactly the kind of person I'd want to do business with. I decided to give Saladworks another chance, visiting twice more, and was pleased to find that the service had significantly improved. The new summer salads are a particular highlight - they're absolutely delicious!", "This deli is the best I've encountered in the entire US, offering a wide variety of unique options that make it difficult to decide. The Muffalata sandwich is enormous, easily shareable among four people, and is incredibly flavorful and delicious. I recommend visiting on Saturday or Thursday evenings when they feature live music. The daily special is always a good choice, and there are plenty of sides to select from, including excellent chili, potato salad, and chips. Don't hesitate - go now and experience it for yourself!", "As my dad and I embarked on our epic cross-country adventure, our inaugural stop was the breathtaking Saguaro National Park. We were fortunate to join a guided tour led by the incomparable Park Ranger Carolyn, whose infectious enthusiasm and vast knowledge of the iconic saguaro cacti left us in awe. Her passion for her work was palpable, making the experience truly unforgettable. If you're planning a visit, I highly recommend joining one of Carolyn's tours - you won't be disappointed!", "So I checked out this spot after my hubby brought home their insane lemon pepper wings. They've got a ton of flavors to choose from - you know, the usual suspects like lemon pepper and mild, but also some more unique ones like yaka mein and noonie bird, which are inspired by New Orleans. And don't even get me started on their drinks! The watermelon flavor is literally amazing... I have no idea what kind of magic they're using, but it's a game-changer. The location could be better, but you can tell they're really trying to give back to the community. It's near the daiquiri shop, so it's not so bad during the day. I might not venture out there alone at night, though. Anyway, def give this place a shot - and you might even run into Skip!", "Hey there! I'm back at Tom Jones and I've got an update for you! I noticed that weird ATM machine that only lets you take out cash to pay for your meal is gone - it used to be near the restrooms. But don't worry, there's still a payphone back there, and I'm obsessed with it! Now, there are ATMs at the front entrance, so that's convenient.\n\nThe blue ribbon deal is still a steal at $3.79 - you get pancakes, 2 eggs, toast, sausage, bacon, juice, and coffee! My kids and I went there recently, and my daughter just loves Tom Jones. We ordered a bunch of stuff, including blue ribbons, French toast, chicken, a club sandwich, and a baked potato. Everyone got exactly what they wanted.\n\nI didn't notice any stale smoke smell, and the place didn't feel dirty to me. I actually love the bright orange booths - they're so retro! And the payphone is just the cherry on top. The service is always super fast, and I always get a different waitress. I don't know where they find these awesome young ladies, but they're doing something right! The managers are all on top of things too, which is great to see.\n\nSince Tom Jones is my daughter's fave spot, I'm bumping up my rating from 4 to 5 stars. It's definitely a winner in my book!", "As an amateur athlete, I've had the privilege of meeting Dr. Ferrel under circumstances I'd rather forget. During a softball game, I suffered a severe injury that left me sidelined. Dr. Ferrel, who was in attendance, rushed to my aid and expertly relocated my ankle on the field. He then invited me to visit his office for further treatment. However, as a single mother living on a teacher's salary, I was hesitant due to financial constraints. Instead, I sought care from a physician, who delivered a disheartening prognosis: months of recovery before I could return to the game. Feeling defeated and hopeless, I reached out to Dr. Ferrel once more. True to his word, he took me under his care and worked wonders. Not only did he treat my injury, but he also facilitated a remarkable recovery, getting me back on the field in mere weeks. Over the years, I've had the pleasure of returning to Dr. Ferrel for various treatments, each time experiencing astonishing results. To me, he will always be a hero, a testament to the power of exceptional medical care and compassion.", "Get ready for an unforgettable experience! Their shows are always a blast, offering a uniquely entertaining and relaxed atmosphere that will leave you feeling carefree and energized. Plus, enjoy delicious food at a fair price, making it the perfect spot for a fantastic night out with friends or family!", "Craving satisfaction guaranteed! There are those moments when only In-N-Out will do. You know, when nothing else can hit the spot like a juicy, indulgent burger. I'm talking 4 patties, Animal Style, because why settle for less? It's time to treat yourself to the ultimate In-N-Out experience!", "Cindy's establishment is truly exceptional. The culinary experience is enhanced by the outstanding service. The authenticity of the cuisine is matched only by the genuine hospitality of the staff. Notably, all dishes are prepared fresh, and the distinction from other Mexican restaurants is palpable from the first bite. I would highly recommend this establishment to anyone who appreciates authentic Mexican cuisine.", "I have been eager to try Trust Me BBQ for over a year, but my initial visit approximately three months ago was disappointing. Despite waiting in line for 10 minutes, I received no service and ultimately left. After reviewing online feedback, I decided to give the establishment another opportunity to showcase its offerings. Unfortunately, my experience was mixed, with the food being average and the service being subpar. As a result, I am unlikely to return.\n\nThe gentleman attending to us at the counter failed to engage with us in any way, neglecting to speak, smile, or acknowledge our presence. The transaction felt impersonal, akin to interacting with a vending machine. Furthermore, when we placed our order, he failed to listen attentively, resulting in incorrect sides being included in our meals. We were forced to correct him while he was serving us.\n\nIn conclusion, I will likely continue to patronize Down to the Bone BBQ instead. The positives of my experience at Trust Me BBQ included the delicious BBQ sauce, the unique and intriguing macaroni salad, and the moist \"pulled\" pork. However, the negatives outweighed the positives. The chicken was excessively dry and inedible, even when paired with the BBQ sauce. The macaroni and cheese appeared to have been sitting on the steam table for several days, and the collard greens lacked robust flavor.", "I stumbled upon this hidden gem during my week-long visit to the area and I'm so glad I did! The panang chicken was absolutely delicious. I opted for a one-star spicy level and it arrived promptly. I'll definitely be back for more!", "Get ready to fiesta! Cinco de Mayo is all about delicious margaritas, refreshing sangria, and crispy fried treats - and this amazing spot has got it all down pat! They're masters at blending flavors from different cultures to create one-of-a-kind recipes that will tantalize your taste buds. Even though they're not a traditional Mexican joint, they know how to bring the heat with their rock salt and tequila game. And the best part? They just opened a wine bar right next door, perfect for when you need a little extra space or want to try something special. Give it up for their on-the-rocks margaritas and homemade white or red sangria - trust us, it's totally worth the trip!", "Discover the Sweet Gem of Hermitage: A Donut Bakery Like No Other!\n\nTucked away in one of Hermitage's oldest shopping centers lies a hidden treasure - a small, family-owned donut bakery that's a must-visit for anyone with a sweet tooth. Owner Yeu's dedication to his craft is evident in the early morning hours he spends perfecting his recipes to bring you the freshest donuts daily.\n\nBut this bakery is no ordinary donut shop. Yeu's creativity shines through in his unique offerings, including donuts topped with crispy bacon, sweet apple fritters, pigs in a blanket, flaky breakfast pastries, and savory kolaches. And then, there's the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance - the doughssant, a revolutionary fusion of a donut and a croissant that will leave you wanting more!\n\nThe best part? These indulgent treats won't break the bank. Doughssants are only $1.99 each, while regular donuts are a steal at just $0.60 each. As a parent, I can attest that these sweet treats make the perfect gift for my kids' teachers, who absolutely adore them.\n\nAnd to complete the experience, pair your donut with a freshly brewed cup of coffee. Whether you're a local or just visiting, this charming bakery is a must-visit destination that's sure to satisfy your cravings and leave you feeling like you've stumbled upon a sweet secret.", "We've had an absolute blast at every event we've attended! From the energy-packed concerts to the thrilling basketball games, each experience has been an unforgettable adventure. And to top it off, the food has been exceptional, featuring a wide range of local favorites that are sure to satisfy any appetite.", "Fantastic dining experience! We sampled a variety of dishes, including three appetizers and five entrees, and every single one impressed us. The prices are very affordable, and the service is top-notch. I'd highly recommend this restaurant and would definitely return for more.", "The service at this place has gotten worse. We used to come here often, but now we go somewhere else. The service was too slow and they would often forget about us.", "I was disappointed with my recent chicken and rice plate from this establishment. When I placed my order, I specifically requested no sauce on the chicken to make it a healthier option. However, when I opened my to-go container, I was surprised to find an excessive amount of oil - approximately 5-7 tablespoons - which was not what I had been told. Unfortunately, this made the dish unappetizing and unhealthy. I was also surprised given the restaurant's slogan, which emphasizes healthy options. I hope they will take my feedback into consideration to improve their dishes and align with their brand promise.", "I'm absolutely thrilled with my recent purchase of a washer and dryer from Sears! As a new homeowner, I needed to furnish my entire place with new appliances, and I'm so glad I chose Sears despite some mixed reviews. My experience was completely seamless - the selection was amazing, the sales team was super knowledgeable, and the delivery was lightning-fast. The level of service I received was truly exceptional! The team went above and beyond to find me the best deals and stayed within my budget. They even took the time to scour for additional discounts and sales prices. I appreciated their honest advice and prompt answers to all my questions. I'm thoroughly impressed with Sears and would highly recommend them to anyone!", "I'm obsessed with the food here! The service is super speedy, and the staff is genuinely lovely. Every time I walk in to place an order, I feel like I'm among friends - they always make me feel so welcome!", "As a skeptic, I walked into the remodeled establishment with low expectations. But, I was pleasantly surprised. The revamped atmosphere was impressive, and the real test - the food - did not disappoint. The mushroom cheese steak, in particular, stole the show.", "I'm obsessed with the espresso here - it's seriously top-notch! This is my go-to spot for a perfect Americano. The staff is super friendly and polite, and the atmosphere is always chill and relaxed. Just a heads up, though: there aren't any power outlets, so come charged up! On the bright side, the wifi is unlimited and always reliable. And, I've gotta say, the bathrooms and the whole place are always spotless.", "I fell hook, line, and sinker for the rave reviews, but my experience was a crushing disappointment from start to finish. The website, which I thought would give me a sneak peek into their menu, was a letdown. I had to navigate through three locations and scroll to the bottom to find a list of options with zero descriptions or prices. It was like they wanted to keep their menu a secret! \n\nWhen I arrived, I was surprised to find a bar-like atmosphere with tables scattered around. No big deal, but I was excited to try their sandwiches, which were reasonably priced at $6.85. I opted for the roast beef and roast pork combos, hoping for the best. \n\nThe sandwiches arrived quickly, but that's where the excitement ended. The roast beef was ice-cold, while the roast pork was piping hot. I mean, how does that even happen? It was clear that one of them had been sitting around for a while. I asked my waitress to reheat the roast beef, and although it was warmer when it came back, it was still lukewarm compared to the roast pork I had just devoured. \n\nThe real kicker was the lack of meat in both sandwiches. It was like they were trying to make up for it by drowning them in gravy, making them a messy, structural nightmare. The menu did mention a \"wet meat\" option, which I now realize is a must-have. If you're planning to visit, trust me and opt for that style \u2013 your taste buds and sandwich will thank you.", "Village Whiskey's takeout treasure: a indulgent delight for the senses! The Whiskey Burger, a luxurious treat at $26, is a must-try for those who dare to get a little messy. This juicy behemoth is packed with tender goodness, crispy bacon, and a generous helping of flavor. If you can stomach the steep price tag, get ready for a burger that will leave you weak in the knees. And don't even get me started on the Duck Fat fries - rich, decadent, and utterly irresistible. Treat yourself, but don't say I didn't warn you...", "I recently invested $80 in a family meal and found it to be a worthwhile expenditure. The food was served hot and the orange chicken was exceptionally flavorful, surpassing my expectations. As a result, this establishment has earned its place as our go-to destination for Asian cuisine.", "I usually do my laundry at my boyfriend's house, but with recent family visitors, I had a mountain of towels, sheets, and comforters to tackle. I needed a reliable laundry mat that was safe, clean, and free of unsavory characters. That's when I stumbled upon this gem of a facility. I was thrilled to find it spotless, well-lit, and staffed by friendly and helpful attendants. The laundry and drying process was incredibly fast - I managed to complete four oversized loads (equivalent to eight regular loads) in under two hours! The amenities were impressive, too: security cameras, flat-screen TVs, magazines, Wi-Fi, clean restrooms, and vending machines. The atmosphere was pleasant and relaxed, with plenty of available washers and dryers. I'm so grateful to have discovered this laundry mat - thank you for providing such a wonderful experience!", "We popped in for a spontaneous dinner last evening. The prices were undoubtedly steep. Both pairs of us opted to share a dish, which visibly irked our server, and while the cuisine was satisfying, it didn't quite justify the cost. One notable exception was the incredible garlic bread they served as an appetizer - I could have easily devoured an entire loaf! Overall, I'm unlikely to return to this establishment, but it's possible we caught them on an off night. With so many exceptional dining options in the St. Louis area, the competition is simply too fierce.", "I scored a touchdown with my lunch plans today, catching a Seahawks/Saints game at this hotspot and indulging in the mouth-watering Haven burger. No surprise the place was buzzing with energy - the flavors were a real winner! I snagged a seat by the door, but soon found myself navigating a sea of fans to get out - clearly, I wasn't the only one in on the secret. I'll be back for another round, maybe on a quieter Tuesday lunch to avoid the frenzy. The Haven has earned a spot on my playbook!", "I've only tried the vermicelli bowls, not the Pho. The portions are decent and reasonably priced. As a bonus, the location is convenient for Alberta Ave residents, and my orders are always ready in 15 minutes, even on busy Friday nights.", "I recently dined at this restaurant, and unfortunately, the food was a letdown. I opted for the Chicken Marsala, which our waiter recommended, but it was a disappointment. The chicken was thin, tough, and dry, and the accompanying pasta was undercooked and clumpy. To make matters worse, the dish lacked any discernible flavor.\n\nMy friend's lasagna was also a miss, with a meager layer of pasta and no flavor to speak of. To add insult to injury, when my other friend got up to use the restroom, the staff cleared her plate, despite her telling the waiter she wasn't finished. Although they did bring her a new meal in a to-go bag, it was a frustrating experience.\n\nOn the bright side, the atmosphere was great, and the live music was a nice touch. I did enjoy dancing with my husband. However, considering the subpar food, the high prices were hard to swallow.", "This hidden gem boasts an attractive space and a prime location near the Broad Street line, with ample street parking available. As a BYOB establishment, you can bring your favorite drinks to enjoy with their delicious dishes. I've had the pleasure of dining here twice, and every dish has impressed me. Standouts include the flavorful chaats, tender beef short ribs, spicy lamb vindaloo, refreshing beet salad, and savory breads and pickles. The rich chocolate cake is a must-share for the table. Plus, you can grab takeout beer from the corner bar. We can't wait to return and try more!", "I highly recommend this restaurant! The ceviche is a must-try, it's absolutely delicious. The atmosphere is lively and enjoyable, and the service is top-notch. Our server, Alex, provided exceptional service - he was friendly, attentive, and thoughtful, making our dining experience truly memorable.", "I love this store! The salad bar is always fresh, and they offer a wide variety of ethnic foods to try. Highly recommended!", "I recently ordered a delicious Mediterranean chicken shawarma that exceeded my expectations. The generous serving of juicy chicken packed into a flavorful pita was a pleasant surprise. The convenience of having my food ready for pickup upon arrival was a bonus. The excellent service only added to the positive experience, ensuring that I'll definitely be back for more when I'm in the area again.", "I'm absolutely obsessed with this hidden gem! The cuisine is mouth-watering, the ambiance is warm and inviting, and the staff are incredibly friendly and attentive. Whether you're a veggie enthusiast or a meat lover, this spot is a must-visit destination that's sure to delight!", "After a brief wait, we finally received excellent service. The gumbo was outstanding, and the chicken and waffles were a highlight. The friendly staff and prime location on Bourbon Street made for great people-watching.", "I'm so glad I stumbled upon Earl's at the airport! This grab-and-go spot really delivers with its variety of delicious sandwiches - from classic turkey and tuna to a tasty Hawaiian option. But today, the aroma of roast beef won me over, and I'm so glad it did! The generous portion of tender, perfectly cooked beef paired with melted cheddar cheese and a zesty horseradish sauce was absolute perfection. And the best part? No need for lettuce or tomatoes - it's just right the way it is! Plus, its convenient location between the security station and the D gates (just a stone's throw from the Delta SkyClub!) makes it easy to grab and enjoy at the gate or on the plane. Yum!", "I'm blown away by this place! The food is top-notch and the service is even better. We kicked things off with an amazing appetizer of cheese curds served with a sweet and spicy red pepper jelly - it was love at first bite! For dinner, I went with the fish tacos and my wife opted for a beer brat. We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals, and the portions were huge and reasonably priced. Our server was fantastic, super attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. They made us feel right at home. The manager even stopped by to check in and I let him know that I've found my new go-to spot to catch a game and grab a beer. He filled us in on their game-day deals and weekend brunch specials. As we left, everyone bid us farewell and reminded us to grab a root beer candy on our way out. I'll definitely be back!", "I stumbled upon a hidden gem for dinner and drinks, and I'm still beaming with delight! As a self-proclaimed burger connoisseur, I usually shy away from ordering them at restaurants since I can whip up a mean patty at home. But, oh boy, this place has ruined me for life! The burger was so phenomenal that I'll be hard-pressed to resist ordering it again on my next visit. The cherry on top? A solid beer selection and a warm, welcoming team of wait staff and bartenders who made me feel like a regular. My meal was cooked to perfection, arrived promptly, and the atmosphere was cozy and inviting. And, let's not forget the sparkling clean restrooms - a true testament to their attention to detail! All in all, I left feeling thoroughly impressed and already counting down the days until my return."]
