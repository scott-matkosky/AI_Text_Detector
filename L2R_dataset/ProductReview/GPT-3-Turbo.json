["If you choose to dine here, please keep in mind that the whole experience will likely take about 2 hours. Despite giving it multiple tries in the hopes of enjoying it, the service tends to be slow, with the food taking a considerable amount of time to be served. The waitstaff is generally young, yet friendly. However, due to consistently long wait times, we often opt for other dining establishments on weekends for a quicker meal.", "I have attended numerous spin classes in the past, but none are as impressive as the ones offered at Body Cycle. The facility is clean and well-maintained, equipped with top-quality bikes. The instructors are friendly, motivational, and create challenging workouts. The online scheduling system allows for easy planning, eliminating the need to line up early like many other gyms.\n\nI must acknowledge Russell, the owner of Body Cycle, for his dedication to fitness and cycling. He is deeply committed to his clients' success, regularly checking in on classes and providing encouragement. Russell is approachable, always open to feedback and suggestions, and maintains a positive attitude even during intense workouts.", "Family-friendly restaurant with a diverse buffet featuring a variety of tasty items such as a large chicken leg, fried jalape\u00f1o, tamale, rolled grape leaves, and fresh melon. The Mexican options are plentiful and they offer breakfast all day alongside their buffet. The staff is attentive and welcoming, making it the perfect spot for a laid-back meal without any fuss. Conveniently located next to the Clarion Hotel.", "Wow! The lamb curry and korma are our favorite dishes here. They offer 10 different types of naan that you can enjoy. Don't be discouraged by the appearance of the restaurant, as we almost considered not going in ourselves. Give it a try and explore something different \u2013 you won't regret it!", "The charming interior and the friendly owner gave us a tour of the upcoming patio/rooftop area, which will be perfect on beautiful days like today. The cheese curds were tasty and satisfying. I appreciated that the sandwiches came with a salad, especially after indulging in too many curds! I ordered the onion, gruyere, and tomato sandwich, which had just the right amount of cheese for my liking. It could have used an additional flavor element, perhaps some pepper jelly. I hope they add more menu options, such as salads with interesting cheeses. They have a good selection of beer and wine, with a few cocktail choices. Next time, I plan to try one of the draft wines.", "I have been a loyal customer of this establishment for a long time. Today, I went in to order three appetizers for takeout, but was informed that they were too busy to accommodate my request. Despite the fact that the restaurant was only half full, I was disappointed by their response. As a regular patron and generous tipper, I will be taking my business elsewhere. I am pleased to have discovered Kanella, and I have no intention of returning to Dmitris in the future.", "I enjoyed this tour a lot! I used a groupon and got it for a great price. It was a great way to explore New Orleans for someone like me who had never been there and didn't know much about the city's history. Our tour guide shared many interesting facts about the city, and I really liked the whole experience. I highly recommend this tour. I initially thought we would only visit the cemetery, but she showed us around the French Quarter first for an hour, and then we went to the cemetery for the rest of the tour. We met in front of a grocery store, which may seem odd at first, but it's easy to find and gives you a chance to grab some water. There's also a bathroom break at a visitor center midway through the tour if needed. This tour was one of the highlights of my trip!", "Incredibly delicious wings paired with homemade bleu cheese are just the beginning! The ribeye was tender, perfectly prepared, and downright delicious. Plus, they offer a fantastic selection of craft beers. You absolutely must uncover this hidden gem - it's a culinary experience not to be missed!", "This Easter, instead of visiting Lopez Lake, we opted for a trip to the Los Padres National Forest, which is incredibly beautiful. Yet, if you plan to visit White Rock, it's important for the staff to clear away the dead grass encroaching on the rock and the water. I also hope they will make an effort to remove the dead grass near the water's edge. The water appears green and murky. The staff at Los Padres National Forest must dedicate themselves to keeping this forest maintained and picturesque, rather than resembling a landfill. Even Cachuma Lake seems to have put in more effort.", "We had a party of 6 at a hibachi restaurant. Our waitress served our separate sushi orders on one plate, making it hard to tell whose was whose, and she forgot several items from our order. The restaurant was surprisingly quiet, which was unexpected for a hibachi experience. Our cook, Francisco, cooked well but didn't say much. The service felt off, the food was decent, and I hope it was just an off night. Overall, for the price, I wouldn't return.", "I had a wonderful experience with Shalimar when I needed to resize my engagement ring. Over the phone, they said it could likely be done the same day. When I brought it in, the team confirmed they could accommodate my request for $40. Despite my mistake in the size, Shalimar resized the ring perfectly at no extra charge. Their understanding and quick service truly impressed me, making me a loyal and satisfied customer.", "Locals highly recommend Milktooth, praising it as a remarkable gem of Indianapolis. I am glad to have had the opportunity to experience it.", "I enjoy coming here for happy hour or dinner! The patio is great with fans to keep cool in the St. Louis heat. This place is very accommodating. I recommend trying the Veal Milanese with mixed greens instead of pasta, they are willing to customize dishes to your liking.", "Delight in the flavors of the ethereal gnocchi with marinara and the scrumptious baked eggplant appetizer \u2013 they truly stole the show! While the service may have been a tad sluggish, the delectable food overshadows any wait time. Count me in for a return visit \u2013 that's how much I adored the food!", "The bun elevates the Sonoran Dog to a whole new level of comfort, like a cozy embrace for your taste buds. Initially seemingly over-the-top, it surprises with its perfect balance of warmth, softness, and indulgence. It outshines even the most renowned Sonoran Dogs out there. While the hot dog and bacon could use a bit more bite to stand out against the bold mustard and onions, the carne asada caramelo takes the spotlight with its delicious combination of flavors. All this goodness at an unbeatable price and the convenience of a drive-through.", "Had a fantastic breakfast experience at this spot! The waffle was perfectly fluffy, while the home fries were nicely smashed and had a delightful crunch. The waitstaff was super friendly. I'll definitely return in the future!", "Great service provided by Douglas complemented the delicious food. While the establishment is on the pricier side with an average main course cost of $40-50, it successfully delivers an atmosphere that rivals any top-tier restaurant nationwide.", "My husband and I have dined here many times and we've enjoyed every part of the meal on each visit. The staff, from servers to the bartender, is very knowledgeable about the menu and was able to recommend items that are safe for me to eat as-is, or make substitutions or omissions for my Celiac condition. The wine and cocktail menus are excellent and the food is divine. My only request would be for a gluten-free dessert option, as we have had to go elsewhere for something sweet. Overall, I still plan to return here repeatedly.", "I visit a blow bar for my brow appointment with Natalie, who is a brow specialist that I highly recommend. She does an excellent job on my eyebrows! I also received a blowout from Victoria, and I was impressed. Despite having thin, straight, lifeless hair, she gave me the biggest volume I've ever had! I tried another stylist afterward but didn't like the result as much, so Victoria will be my go-to stylist forever. The place is very beautiful and clean!", "My favorite cafe in the city has to be this one. The black and white latte they serve is probably the best I've ever tasted - not too sweet with just the right amount of foam. Their soups are consistently delicious, even for those who aren't big soup fans, and there's plenty of room to work. The ambiance is just right with the perfect noise level and music volume, and I love it when customers bring their dogs. I'll definitely continue to support this cafe as long as I can.", "WOWZA! Real pumpkin pie swirled in with the frozen custard....can you believe it? Why hasn't this exploded into the biggest sensation across the nation? The absolute highlight was those delightful chunks of pie crust. It's like discovering a treasure within a treasure. Absolutely delicious!", "Upland Brewery, originating from Bloomington, Indiana, has expanded to multiple locations in central Indiana due to its increasing popularity. While all their beers are exceptional and their burgers and tenderloins are favorites of mine, the pizza did not meet my high expectations. The margherita pizza had a thin, cracker-like crust and lacked depth in flavor despite the good quality cheese. Disappointingly, the absence of red sauce deviated from the traditional margherita pizza. In my view, Upland's pizza may suit as a decent appetizer for a group gathering, but for future visits, my preference remains with their burgers or tenderloins as a satisfying meal choice.", "I was completely engrossed by the show - the perfect way to unwind on a Friday evening.", "This is the go-to spot for sushi in our town! Whenever those sushi cravings hit and you're short on time, this place has got you covered. Their salmon is an absolute standout - it's a must-order every time we visit. And don't even get me started on their spicy edamame, tempura, ocean salad, and cabbage salad - they are all just so good! Plus, the service here is always friendly and quick, making the whole experience even better!", "I was indecisive between rating this establishment with 3 or 4 stars. Having a fondness for the 96th street Naked Tchopstix, I eagerly anticipated visiting this location, which is conveniently closer to my residence. The ambience here is distinctively oriented towards takeout, although they do offer a reasonably spacious dining area. Upon arrival, customers place their orders at the counter for subsequent delivery.\n\nDuring my visit with my daughter, we opted for the sushi bowl. Customers are provided with a paper form to customize their bowl by choosing from a selection of proteins, vegetables, rice, and toppings. I appreciate this method as it eliminates the need for guesswork or the necessity to speak loudly over the counter to communicate preferences to the server.\n\nWhile the sushi bowl was satisfactory, it did not exceed expectations. I found the variety of vegetables somewhat limited, and the proportion of rice compared to other ingredients seemed unbalanced. However, the sauces complemented the dish nicely. On the contrary, my husband ordered the Maui roll, a personal favorite from the 96th street location, which did not meet the same high standard. Although enjoyable, the quality and consistency of this roll did not match that of the 96th street spot.\n\nDespite the aforementioned shortcomings, I would consider revisiting this establishment. Many patrons may find satisfaction in the sushi bowls offered here. I would like to address negative reviews regarding the service. Given that it is a sushi-focused establishment rather than a fast-food chain like McDonald's, patrons should expect a slightly longer wait time for their orders. One should not anticipate an expedited dining experience akin to fast food despite the restaurant's name touting \"express\" service. The slight delay is ultimately worthwhile for those seeking a healthy fast-food alternative in the vicinity.\n\nFurthermore, I recommend trying the bubble tea. I particularly enjoyed the strawberry variant, but intend to sample the vanilla chai on my next visit.", "Had a delicious lunch with an awesome beef brisket sandwich \u2013 so juicy and tender! The pulled pork was just as good.", "\"The thai cuisine at this establishment is exceptional and truly authentic. Every dish we tried was not only delicious but also delivered an authentic taste. Needless to say, we will be returning to enjoy this culinary experience time and time again.\"", "The service left much to be desired and the food was fairly average. In hindsight, I regret not choosing a different dining spot for my final meal in town.", "My wife and I enjoyed a delightful dinner at this restaurant over the weekend and were extremely satisfied! The food was exceptional, and we were impressed by the quick service. We particularly liked that everything tasted homemade and fresh. The only challenge was deciding what to order from the tempting menu with so many delicious options. We look forward to coming back to try more dishes and discover the upcoming chef specials!", "I must give this restaurant two stars for the decent food. During a dinner meeting where I spent $100 on entr\u00e9es and appetizers, I had to ask the assistant cook (the guy in bright red baggy pants watching TV) for extra avocado for my tuna. He couldn't assist me and directed me to ask my waitress to add the $4 avocado to the bill.", "\"First time visiting and it was amazing!!! It feels like you're entering a friend's house. The waiters are funny and kind. The food comes out very quickly and it's exceptional!!! I will definitely be returning to this place.\"", "Exciting news for all food enthusiasts! Indulge in succulent burgers, crispy fries, and refreshing salads bursting with flavors. The burgers here boast a delightful touch of salt and pepper to titillate your taste buds. Step into this charming location with cozy outdoor seating and be greeted by a warm and friendly staff. Convenient street parking is available, along with a parking lot at the back. Get ready for a dining experience like no other!", "Outstanding staff who are always friendly and helpful in a clean and spacious store, ensuring it is fully stocked with all your needs. They create my perfect custom breakfast bagel with ease.", "I brought my vehicle here a few years ago for some work due to a manufacturer recall. After the initial problem was resolved, I started hearing another noise which I assumed was related, but it turned out to be a completely different issue. Kevin and his mechanic lifted my car and fixed the problem FREE OF CHARGE, despite my offer to pay. Their exceptional service and generosity are truly commendable. I highly recommend them!", "After my eye-opening experience at another Sweet CeCe's, I couldn't help but realize that I had neglected to share my thoughts on the gem right in my own backyard! Let me tell you, I am absolutely smitten with their delectable offerings. Utterly enamored, you could say. Not only do they offer a delightful array of toppings that strike the perfect balance between indulgence and health, but the product itself is simply divine. Yet, I must confess, there are moments when the attention of the staff falters, leaving one to fend for oneself. On occasion, gentle reminders about ongoing deals may be necessary. Nevertheless, my affection for this place runs deep, warranting no less than a solid 4-star rating in my book. Sweet CeCe's has truly captured my heart.", "Check out this fantastic new spot in the Funk Zone! Enjoy delicious bites and tastings in a superb setting right next to the Santa Barbara Wine Collective. The best part? They share the same tables! Don't miss their fabulous savory croissant - it's a must-try! Life is good here.", "This is a delightful and tranquil establishment for receiving massages. Securing same-day appointments is effortlessly accessible. I have consistently been impressed by the high level of skill and professionalism exhibited by every therapist at the Center.", "We arrived around 2:30 pm and the check-in process was quick and easy, including complimentary valet parking which was a nice touch. The Peppermill is quite large and it reminded us of Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. They have about eight restaurants on-site offering a wide variety of food options. The casino area is expansive, comparable to what you would find in Las Vegas. However, we did notice that several slot machines were labeled as penny machines but had minimum bets ranging from 30 cents to $5, which was a bit misleading.\n\nOur room was located in the Tuscany Tower on the 12th floor and had a lovely view of the pool area. It was spacious and equipped with free WiFi, a generous bathroom featuring a large shower with two shower heads, a TV, a sizeable jetted bathtub, and even a phone next to the toilet. The bathroom had dual sinks, ample counter space, and plenty of towels. The main area of the room contained a king-sized bed with nightstands, a closet, a TV, a mini-fridge, a dresser with two drawers, a safe, a table for working or writing, complimentary bottles of water, as well as three well-upholstered chairs and a table.\n\nThe thermostat worked well in maintaining a comfortable temperature. The staff were all friendly and helpful, making our stay enjoyable. Overall, it was a very pleasant experience and we had a good time at the Peppermill.", "My partner and I visited a new deli today and tried their offerings for the first time. I enjoyed a turkey, avocado, and bacon panini, while he had a buffalo chicken wrap. We had a positive experience and plan to visit again. The food was served promptly, which is great during the busy lunch period. The deli offered a wide variety of options including salads, soups, macaroni, sandwiches, and hot meals, making it a preferred choice for us.", "Delicious biscuits and (fill in the blank)! Fantastic cocktails as well. Definitely worth trying out, although it can get a little crowded at times.", "The food was excellent, the atmosphere is reminiscent of a lively fishing lodge, and the menu strikes a perfect balance between Outback and Bonefish. Thanks to a Groupon deal, all three of our meals and the calamari appetizer were cooked to perfection! We can't wait to go back!", "Check out our fantastic dining option where affordability meets satisfaction! \ud83d\udc4c\n\n\ud83c\udf1f The highlights: \n- Fantastic prices\n- Convenient location\n- Delicious desserts including a variety of options like baked and fried chicken, mashed potatoes, salad bar (and more!)\n- Exceptional service from our amazing waitress\n\n\ud83d\ude10 The so-so aspects: \n- Behind-the-counter meat slicing station\n- Unimpressive shrimp offerings\n- Mexican station may not meet expectations\n\n\ud83d\udc4e What to skip:\n- Disappointing breakfast offerings, especially the eggs\n- Le Benedict falls short with ham and English muffin\n- Lackluster steak and shrimp dishes\n- Breaded items missed the mark\n- Outdated 1970s decor\n\nGive us a try \u2013 we're here to turn your dining experience around! \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f\ud83c\udf89", "The sole reason for withholding a 5-star rating from this restaurant was a singular interaction with a pretentious waiter. As a four-night guest at Hotel Palomar, the restaurant\u2019s location stands out as a definitive perk. On my first evening there, I met a colleague for cocktails in the restaurant. Upon arrival, the host staff seemed preoccupied, prompting us to seat ourselves at a small table by the bar. When a waiter approached us, I inquired about seating before proceeding to order cocktails. The waiter's response was hesitant and unconvincing, leaving us with a sense of indifference. Despite this initial encounter, we carried on with our conversation, only to find his demeanor distant throughout our visit. When it came time to settle the bill, requesting a split payment due to company policies seemed to pose an unreasonable demand to him. The evening concluded with a lingering sense of astonishment at the rudeness we had encountered. \n\nWhile this experience initially soured our impression, we opted to revisit the restaurant the following evening for cocktails, making sure to steer clear of the previous waiter. Approaching the bar, we were greeted warmly by the bartender who engaged us in pleasant conversation, recommending cocktails and displaying genuine interest in our experience. This bartender, identified possibly as Ben, shone as an exemplary host, offering insights on whiskey, sharing the art of crafting classic cocktails, and entirely embodying the essence of hospitality. His kindness, humor, and engaging demeanor not only redeemed the restaurant but went above and beyond the expected standards of a 4/5-star establishment. Indeed, his exceptional service became the highlight of our evening and reinstated our faith in the venue. \n\nAnd, not to be overlooked, the room service provided by this restaurant was exceptional, with the bacon-wrapped dates and chocolate cake standing out as particularly delicious offerings. Despite encountering one negative encounter, the overall experience was saved by the outstanding service of the bartender and the quality of the food.", "I stopped in after a refreshing Sunday morning stroll in the park and was blown away by the amazing food, coffee, and top-notch customer service! The vibe in this place is absolutely fantastic!", "One word: \"OVERRATED!\" The wait for the food felt endless. My burger, meant to be cooked medium rare, arrived way overcooked. The Seafood Jambalaya, though decent, failed to impress. The price hardly justified the experience. You can find superior dining options in the French Quarter. While it wasn't intolerable, based on all the hype, one would anticipate a far superior culinary adventure.", "I was thoroughly impressed by the cozy bed, delicious breakfast, speedy internet, ideal location, and affordable rates at this place. However, guests on the higher floors might experience up to a 15-minute wait for the elevator in the mornings.", "Never again will I visit this so-called restaurant that lacks all the essential elements of proper service. Despite its ability to prepare food, much of the dining experience is left to the customer. Thirsty? You'll need to fetch your own water from across the yard. Craving a drink? Head up a flight of stairs to pay with cash. Want to relax in a grungy outdoor space with unkempt lawn chairs? Go right ahead. The wait staff only plays a minor role by bringing you your food after you've paid at the window - similar to New Orleans Hamburger and Seafood, but with a grubbier setting and live music (a nice touch). This was a unique experience for me, one that I won't be repeating.", "If you prefer to pay for items individually, this is the place for you. The food was okay but not outstanding. We were served a basket of chips and tomato sauce, and requested spicier options like pico de gallo. The server happily brought them, and the salsa was an improvement. When we asked for drinks, I requested a fountain Coke, but was informed they only had bottled Pepsi. It wasn't mentioned earlier that only bottled drinks were available. We ordered our reasonably priced food and requested sour cream and cheese for the taco. We were informed that cheese was an additional charge. Another basket of chips cost $2.50 extra. Surprisingly, we ended up paying more for condiments than for the actual food. Sour cream was $2.00, pico de gallo $2.50, salsa $2.00, chips $2.50, cheese $1.00, and an unwanted bottled Coke $5.00. A suggestion for future orders: always ask if there are extra charges for additional items.", "The coffee shop was incredibly charming. We arrived at 8am and to our surprise, there was a live jazz band performing. I ordered the breakfast sandwich which was delightful - the unique touch of rolling the egg and including bacon pieces was a highlight. The breakfast was satisfying and reasonably priced.", "This place is amazing! I was so excited to try their duckfat french fries. I came here with my son for his birthday and we put our name in. While we waited for a table, we had a drink nearby and after about 45 minutes, we were seated at the bar. Keith, the bartender, took care of us and he was friendly and knew a lot about whiskey. We enjoyed Cape May salts and tater tots as appetizers. For dinner, I had the Kentucky Fried Quail, which was delicious, and my son had the $24 Fois Gras burger, which was fantastic. The duckfat fries were tasty, but not the highlight of the meal. I will definitely be returning with all my friends.", "We commenced our meal with the artichoke dip, but unfortunately, it was a regrettable choice. The dip was served cold, and the accompanying chips were stale. Despite bringing this matter to the attention of our waitress, no resolution was offered. Our subsequent selection of a large, thin-crust pizza, although admittedly slightly overpriced after the addition of toppings, failed to exceed expectations. The pizza was satisfactory but did not attain culinary greatness. While our server did not take on the role of an advocate, she provided competent service. I have previously dined at this establishment during a Cardinals game and found the experience to be superior. Consequently, I plan to explore alternative dining venues in the future.", "My fiance wanted a laid back Thai restaurant for his birthday dinner. We decided on Jasmine Rice based on Yelp reviews, and it was a good choice. We ordered pan-fried dumplings instead of the summer rolls we wanted since they were not available. The dumplings were good, but we wouldn't order them again. The green curry fried rice with duck and chicken pad thai were both delicious, with the duck being the standout. The pad thai was a bit too sweet for our taste. We might try a different noodle dish next time. The service was good overall, but some customers faced issues. Despite that, the owner ensured one customer received the missing item in their take-out order promptly, which was nice. In general, it was a good quality Thai restaurant, and we would be happy to return.", "I adore Courtney! She is undoubtedly the most talented hairstylist I've ever had. What sets her apart is her ability to understand what suits me best and respect my style boundaries. Every time I visit the salon, I simply ask her to work her magic, and I am always amazed by the results. A sign of a great stylist is when they instinctively know what needs to be done without you having to provide detailed instructions. Courtney is not only skilled but also has a wonderful personality and vast knowledge in her field. I wholeheartedly recommend her to anyone who wants to enhance their appearance.", "I used to visit this place frequently when I lived in the area. Despite being a chain and lacking a certain appeal, it serves its purpose well. If you require an oil change or a state inspection, this place is sufficient. However, it's best to visit when they aren't busy to avoid a long wait. Overall, it's just your typical Pep Boys\u2014nothing extraordinary, but decent enough.", "Two old Lennox units from the 1970s were replaced with two new ones. The installation was performed successfully, and the units have been running efficiently for the past three years.", "I love the Brewpub for its diverse menu featuring nachos, pizza, sandwiches, and a variety of house-crafted beers. Although the service may be slow, it encourages you to relax, enjoy the patio, and savor the time with friends. The venue is kid and dog-friendly, catering well to vegetarian and vegan options. Personally, I recommend the half order of nachos or fish & chips. The Pumpkin Seasonal Beer is a must-try and rivals some of my favorite pumpkin brews.", "Rustic-chic farmhouse store with a helpful staff offering great home decor ideas at reasonable prices. Find items from Joanna Gaines (Fixer Upper) and more. Finally, a good home store in SB with affordable prices.", "My brother's visit turned into an unforgettable night as we set out to find the perfect six pack of quality beers for a cozy evening in. Little did we know that it would lead to an impromptu gaming session on their donated Nintendo 64 playing Super Smash Brothers. Surrounded by good food and even better company, we found ourselves lost in the warm embrace of this remarkable place. It's more than just a spot in the Northeast \u2013 it's a charming haven that should be cherished and celebrated by all.", "A different take on the passage:\n\nI usually stick to my favorite dishes of coconut soup and pad thai with protein, and this time was no exception. Surprisingly, I found the coconut soup here to be quite delightful. It had just the right balance of coconut milk, resulting in a rich and creamy texture without being overwhelmingly herbal. Coming from a background of heavily Americanized Thai cuisine, I appreciate dishes with a lighter herb profile, with the exception of cilantro. The pad thai didn't disappoint either. The amount of peanuts added was just right, the noodles were perfectly chewy, and the dish wasn't overly sweet. I was pleased to find a generous portion of juicy chicken, and the white meat was exceptionally tender. Overall, my dining experience left me completely satisfied.", "Great service! The restaurant has delicious diner food available all day, including breakfast. I went for lunch and it was quite busy, but the staff was very friendly and welcoming. Conveniently located off the 295 highway.", "My favorite bar on Saturdays! Disappointed by Lucy's closing, but found a great spot across the street with better-than-expected food. Love their wings and fries, but watch out for the spicy sauce. Service can be slow with the bar being busy, but it's worth it. And you might even spot the Always Sunny crew!", "We were hesitant about giving the Shellfish Company on the Wharf a try, as similar establishments in places like Cannery Row, Monterey often take advantage of a captive audience by offering subpar food at high prices. Despite our reservations, encouraged by the consistently positive reviews on Yelp, we set aside our initial concerns and decided to give it a shot. The restaurant is small, so it's wise to plan ahead. Expect a wait, so either be prepared to wait patiently or consider visiting during off-peak hours. Fortunately, our wait was only around 20 minutes since the dinner rush was dying down. The featured item was the local rock crab - $25 for 3 lbs of California Rock Crab, along with salad and a choice of soup or chowder. After seeing the generous portions of rock crab being served, both my wife and I opted for it. The salad and chowder combo was satisfying, with ample servings of each, making for a solid start. Despite enjoying the chowder, my wife found the Shrimp Bisque she ordered to be exceptional, so I would recommend trying that in the future. But enough about the side dishes - the rock crab was just as delicious as it appeared. The juicy, buttery white crab meat was a delight, requiring minimal effort to extract the meat. Although the rock crab shells were thick, they cracked easily, indicating perfect cooking. The rock crabs provided a substantial amount of meat for what felt like minimal effort, especially compared to other types of crab. We left the meal thoroughly content, and with the value offered by the special, savoring the Rock Crab at SBSC became one of the highlights of our trip. Ordering crab here seems to be a reliable choice.", "I love Weaver's Way and disagree with some reviews. It's not just for quick shopping. As a single woman, I find it convenient with smaller quantities. I enjoy the work hours, like contributing to the membership committee. The community isn't just \"tree huggers\" but diverse like-minded individuals. I appreciate the local produce and wholesome foods. Membership fees and work hours are reasonable. Weaver's Way is great if you value its principles. If not, visit as a guest or stick to chain stores.", "The food at this establishment may not be exceptional, yet it appears to be highly regarded by many patrons. Although I accompany my husband due to his preference for this dining spot, I personally prefer an alternative BBQ venue. It is important to note that the dining experience may be influenced by the specific dishes one chooses to order.", "The television programs cost $4.99 and come with commercials! This strategy to generate revenue seems tacky and indicates a lack of sophistication in the hotel, especially considering the nightly rate is over $150. Additionally, there is no free breakfast, only a costly buffet, a service even budget hotels in California offer.", "I made a brief stop at this location due to its proximity to the hotel where I was accommodated. The personnel at the establishment displayed exceptional kindness and warmth. I was particularly impressed by their buy one, get one deal. Furthermore, I sampled their hot wings, which were quite enjoyable, featuring a generous serving of sauce. I look forward to returning to this establishment during my next visit to avail myself of their delicious pizza offerings.", "I have exclusively sampled the cannolis at this establishment, and they are truly exceptional! These delectable treats are expertly filled upon ordering, boasting a filling of unparalleled quality. With a perfectly balanced sweetness that is not overwhelming, these cannolis are sure to delight. Whether you are an aficionado of cannoli or have yet to discover your fondness for this delightful treat, a visit to Termini Bros. is highly recommended.", "While journeying in our RV, we made a pit stop at Granite City and stumbled upon this charming cafe. The moment we walked in, the staff greeted us warmly. The food here is reminiscent of homemade dishes. We dined here on two occasions, and each time, our meals were fresh, flavorful, and reminiscent of home-cooked food. Delicious!", "I discovered a hidden gem in the Magazine area after working there for 3 weeks. The staff is so welcoming, and let me tell you, their Ph\u00f2 is absolutely fantastic!", "Our family came back for breakfast this weekend and once again, the food and service were outstanding. We highly recommend it.", "The kayaking tour at Santa Cruz Island was fantastic! My husband and I enjoyed exploring the caves with our helpful and informative guide, Jen. The tour exceeded our expectations and we had a wonderful time.", "Highly recommended for those seeking a delightful dining experience without breaking the bank! Don't miss out on the tantalizing shrimp and goat cheese crepes - an absolute must-try!", "After more than a decade in the thriving city of St. Louis, I finally set foot in this iconic spot just a few weeks ago! Let me tell you, I'm kicking myself for not coming sooner. This place is absolutely fantastic\u2014 and the sheer diversity of experiences it offers is astounding! Step into a world where you can take a captivating factory tour (available Friday to Sunday, from noon to 5 pm, every hour), explore the bustling shop, unwind at the lively bar, or savor a delicious meal in the inviting dining area. And that's not all - be entertained with live music during their exciting weekend events. There's never a dull moment here!\n\nPrepare for a bit of waiting time before you dine, but trust me, it's worth it. From the velvety smooth Hefeweizen to mouthwatering homegrown dishes, the beer and food selections are top-notch. I highly recommend the pizza\u2014 it's truly exceptional! Oh, and if you're a pizza aficionado like me, you're in for a treat. And don't miss out on the bison burger either; it's a real delight.\n\nHere's the real kicker\u2014 the service here is stellar. Expect a team of vibrant and unconventional individuals (think tattoo parlor vibes) which only adds to the overall charm. The emphasis on local produce and craft beer truly sets this place apart. Sure, it might be a bit more on the expensive side, but the quality and unforgettable experiences make it all worthwhile. I'm definitely going back for more, and you should too!", "I am sorry to hear about your experience at the burger place. It sounds frustrating to have received a burger with bacon when you ordered a plain one, especially considering your allergy. It's unfortunate that the staff's response was not as accommodating or friendly as expected. On the bright side, it's great that you have found an alternative in Freebirds that you enjoy! It's always nice to have a variety of dining options to choose from. Enjoy your future visits to Freebirds!", "I had a fantastic experience during my first visit here. The car wash and service were top-notch, and I left feeling extremely satisfied. Many thanks for the excellent service!", "I recently discovered Sushi Nara, which just opened this month, and I've quickly fallen in love with it. The restaurant is spotless, the staff is welcoming and accommodating, and the service is speedy. The sushi is consistently delightful as I've visited three times already, and the prices are quite reasonable. My husband recently picked up takeout there, purchasing four sushi rolls for a total of just $24, which is an incredible deal. I appreciate the freshness of the food and the extensive variety available. I highly recommend this place to everyone on the eastside!", "This charming boutique boasts an exceptional selection. The owner is incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about their work, evident in the unique tires and parts they offer, unavailable elsewhere.", "I frequently visit this hidden gem in Florissant for their delicious Panang curry. I have yet to try their sister restaurant because I am always satisfied with the food here.", "The food may have only earned a modest two stars, yet the ambiance and innovative menu at this eatery have captured my attention. Despite this promise, my dining experience left something to be desired; the tomato-basil soup resembled a lackluster marinara, while the tuna melt was marred by a jarring citrusy note. Perhaps an excess of lemon zest was to blame for its overpowering taste? Nevertheless, I am drawn to explore other offerings, particularly the dishes featuring cured Italian meats like mortadella and prosciutto. The bakery items, notably the enticing Nutella bruschetta, also warrant a taste on my next visit.", "We went there once and man, we were totally let down by my veggie pizza and my husband's sub sandwich. The tomato sauce was meh, and they skimped on the cheese on my pizza. And don't even get me started on how the dough seemed like it came straight out of a factory. Maybe things are better now, but honestly, we're not itching to give it another shot anytime soon.", "A few friends and I dropped by More Than Just Ice Cream for some late-night milkshakes and had a great time! Even though we only indulged in ice cream (missing out on the other goodies the name promises), it was still a delightful experience. We tried three milkshake flavors - coffee, chocolate, and black & white malt, and they were all pretty good. Our ice cream cravings were definitely satisfied! I felt that my coffee and chocolate milkshakes could have been thicker, but the black & white malt was a standout. I regret not choosing that one! Before settling on a milkshake, I sampled the pumpkin pie ice cream, which was absolutely amazing. I should've just gone for that! Perhaps next time, ice cream flavors rather than milkshakes will be my go-to choice at this wonderful spot.", "My husband and I recently celebrated my mother's 100th birthday here and it was an absolutely unforgettable experience! The exceptional treatment we received surpassed all expectations - from scoring the perfect table with a breathtaking view, to indulging in mouthwatering \"compliments of the chef\" extras, to being presented with a beautifully decorated cake plate by the attentive and friendly servers. It truly was a special occasion that exceeded our wildest dreams and left a lasting impression on us.", "This place is great! The bartender is awesome and the food is fresh with local ingredients. The plates look amazing, the beer is cold, and the drinks are perfect. It's a dedicated local restaurant with good employees.", "I visited this restaurant a total of 4 times during my 5-day stay - now, that's quite a feat, isn't it? Here's why: - Our nearby hotel made it convenient. - Their opening hours, from 11 am to 10:30 pm daily (yes, even on New Year's Day!), perfectly suited our schedule. - With just a party of two, we always got seated promptly. - At just $9 per dozen oysters, it's an unbeatable deal! - The adjacent seafood shop offers a variety of boiled and fresh seafood to-go. - Our friendly server, who recognized us each time, added a personal touch. But, let's get to the 3-star reasons: - Despite trying various dishes, they were all rather average. The raw oysters weren't well-cleaned. If you can, consider visiting Superior Seafood during happy hours for higher quality oysters at 50 cents each. The turtle soup had an odd taste; Felix's version is more to my liking. Some of the boiled shrimps were disappointingly mushy - perhaps overcooked? - Though the ambiance is nice, it's not very cozy, and we found ourselves eating quickly and leaving. - And a plea to clean the bathroom! If we're in the area again, we might drop by or simply grab some quick seafood to-go.", "If you want a pleasant dining experience, it's best to avoid this disaster of a meal. Our server was so unaware that we wondered if she had lost her way in the restaurant. We had to request basic necessities like utensils, water refills, and so on. Contrary to ordering chicken parmesan, we received eggplant parmesan with a fish bone in it instead. On a positive note, the drinks were enjoyable.", "My impression of TDS is rather lackluster. The establishment, though not literally cold, exudes a sense of chilliness in its ambiance. The absence of decor and menu boards, the use of stainless steel prep tables as dining surfaces, and the presence of numerous unidentified staff members without clear insignias (such as shirts or nametags) all contributed to this underwhelming atmosphere. While the food is reasonably priced and mostly enjoyable, a notable point of contention was the additional charge for extra salsa. As an illustration, upon requesting extra salsa for his tacos amidst a substantial order consisting of a variety of items, my brother was informed that he would need to repurchase the salsa trio containing three samples of different salsas in 2oz glass bowls. This stipulation struck us as rather exorbitant, particularly considering our total expenditure of over $40 on meals, beverages, and appetizers. In light of these factors, despite the satisfactory quality of the food, I am disinclined to revisit TDS due to its lackluster environment and the restriction on acquiring supplementary salsa for one's tacos.", "I am thrilled with our pictures from Angela Clifton Photography! We have had the pleasure of working with them three times now, and each picture captured has brought us immense joy. Not only are the photos stunning, but the experience itself was enjoyable. The pricing is very fair, and these pictures will be cherished as timeless keepsakes.", "I had a lovely meal outside at a sidewalk table. The prices were a bit high, but the food was good. If you're looking for a quieter outdoor dining experience, consider going to Side Street in the French Quarter.", "The courthouse is ancient with impressive artwork. The spiral staircase is quirky. From the fifth floor, you can enjoy a panoramic view of the whole city. The clock tower room is surprisingly fascinating, filled with intricate mechanical gears! Make sure to schedule a visit in advance to see the clock room. It's definitely worth spending 2 to 3 hours exploring this place.", "I had the pleasure of meeting with Ann today and I must say, she was incredibly helpful and positive. Her exceptional service made my first experience here unforgettable. I am now a loyal customer thanks to her outstanding efforts. Thank you, Ann!", "I visited this place for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. I tried a combination meal featuring pad Thai and coconut soup. The soup was delicious, as I had never tasted coconut soup before. The pad Thai met my expectations and was very satisfying. The restaurant had lovely Thai decor and played great music. The staff provided excellent service. In a town with limited food options, this was a refreshing change. It might just become my favorite spot in Carp.", "This location exuded such a serene and calming atmosphere. It will surely be on my radar for future visits. The entertainment by the artist was delightful and diverse (imagine a country rendition of \"Let It Go\" - simply splendid!).", "If you haven't been to the Smoothie King Center since it was known as the New Orleans Arena, you're in for a pleasant surprise! The arena has received a makeover and looks refreshed. While the seats remain the same, everything else has been updated.\n\nOne of the best improvements is the food options, which now cater to a wide variety of tastes. The food quality has significantly improved from a few years ago. The drink choices have also gotten better, with full-service bars, spiked lemonade, bottled and draft beer, and of course, smoothies. They even have a sweet spot offering funnel cake, cotton candy, and other delicious treats.\n\nOverall, the venue now feels more upscale and classy. It's definitely a step up!", "Whenever I have a queasy stomach, Chipotle's steak never fails to make me feel better. I've learned to avoid the busy lunch rush and opt for a peaceful visit between 2 and 4 pm. No matter how busy it is, the service at Chipotle is always friendly and efficient.", "I was pleasantly surprised by this place. It exceeded our expectations. It's definitely one of the top Indian restaurants in the Tampa Bay area. The atmosphere is fantastic with elegant white tablecloths. What truly stood out was the delicious food. The chicken 65 was amazing, and the hot and sour soup was packed with flavor. Our server, Angel, was very nice, attentive, and charming. They just started serving a week ago. I believe this will soon become a hotspot for anyone looking for authentic Indian cuisine.", "On my third journey to NOLA, the doors finally opened for me. After two failed attempts waiting in line, we cleverly scored reserved seats this time, trading the hassle for the pleasure of lounging on benches. And for an extra $20, it was a small price to pay in support of Jazz preservation; a cause so worthy it feels like a delightful splurge. The show itself was nothing short of mesmerizing. The musicians were not just talented but exuded an old-world charm and charisma that transported me back to concerts of yesteryears. Held in a cozy, hole-in-the-wall venue accommodating a mere 200 guests, the intimacy of the setting allowed for a close-up encounter with the gleeful faces of the performers as they passionately shared their art with us. Undoubtedly, an essential experience for anyone exploring the vibrant streets of NOLA!", "Had a great experience at Keystone Discount Tire for a PA State & Emissions inspection. Although I was a new walk-in without an appointment due to a rain delay, they took my 2008 Pontiac Torrent in promptly. The technicians were friendly and allowed me to see any issues, like an alignment concern with my front tires. The inspection was completed quickly, and the bill remained fair without unnecessary add-ons. I highly recommend signing up for their mailing list for coupons.", "I'm thrilled that my son's phone, which I never thought could be repaired after he dropped it, was fixed in less than half an hour. The service was very professional and excellent!", "Poor service and management: Waiter made mistakes with all four orders, leading to confrontation and cursing. Manager offered complimentary drinks due to the issues. Cold and unappetizing food resulted in an hour-long wait. Will avoid dining at Cracker Barrel in the future due to this disappointing experience.", "I have visited several dog-friendly hotels before, but they were usually motel-like and not in a city setting. This particular hotel was located in the heart of the city. Feeling unsure about how my Labrador/Golden Retriever mix would be received, I cautiously entered the hotel lobby. Despite my initial apprehension, the receptionist warmly welcomed us and put us at ease. During check-in, an employee offered treats for Bentley, which she loved. Additionally, they asked if we would like a welcome kit for Bentley, which included dog dishes, a mat, and treats. I was amazed by their hospitality. Other guests at the hotel also complimented and petted Bentley, referring to her as \"queen Bentley.\" Our room was on the top floor, which was fantastic. Even the valets recognized Bentley by name when we went for walks. The exceptional service we received impressed us so much that we decided to extend our stay for an extra night. I want to thank Loews for exceeding my expectations of a dog-friendly hotel, especially for accommodating a large dog like Bentley.", "This food can be amazing at times, but its inconsistency is disappointing. I recently ordered a dish I've enjoyed for years, and while it's usually incredible, this time it fell short. It seems like the kitchen staff changes frequently, leading to varying quality. As a result, only about half of the time is the food excellent. Frustrating!", "This location is a total disappointment! Visited twice and will never return. The first time was mediocre, but the second visit was unbelievably bad. The ribs I ordered were not cooked properly, having to send them back three times until they were edible. The manager offered a half-hearted apology and did not comp anything. Extremely frustrated by the lack of service and sincerity.", "After sampling several ramen establishments boasting an eclectic array of offerings and exquisite broth, my anticipation was somewhat dampened by the ramen experience at Cheu. While acknowledging that taste is subjective, I found myself less enamored by the robust noodles and pervasively salty broth. The impeccable service and diverse beer options were commendable aspects of the visit. In contrast, my companion expressed great enthusiasm for Cheu and has frequented it numerous times. Regrettably, my personal affinity did not align with theirs, though I cordially encourage others to form their own opinion by sampling it firsthand. It appears that my palate may indeed be peculiar in this particular instance.", "Federal Doughnuts is a new food stand at the baseball field selling doughnuts and fried chicken. There's also a new gluten-free concession stand near section 136 that serves pizza, cheesesteaks, brownies, and cookies.", "Exciting news! A new Red Kings restaurant has popped up in Chinatown, and it exceeded all expectations! Although this spot freshly debuted yesterday, it's unclear whether it's taking over the original Red Kings or just offering up more tantalizing, Szechuan delights. Our takeout order of Dan Dan Noodles and Garlic Pork dish was a flavor explosion with just the right amount of heat. These dishes were a perfect blend of sweet, earthy, and fresh flavors that left our taste buds dancing. The portions were so generous that we're looking forward to enjoying the leftovers. We're already eager to return for a full dinner experience and explore the rest of the menu. Even better, they have karaoke rooms upstairs and allow you to bring your own beverages!", "This Chick-fil-A location is impressively busy, yet consistently maintains fast and exceptional service. I am amazed at their efficiency and excellent service every time I visit. It is definitely one of my top favorite places to go.", "This is the best place for salads! I make sure to visit it every time I'm in town for lunch. The service is quick, and the vegetables are consistently fresh.", "My family and I went on a tour of Oak Alley and Laura Plantation on September 26th, 2015. Our driver's name slips my mind, but he shared interesting facts during our journey to the plantations. The timing of the tour was great! We had free time before and after the tour to explore the properties at our leisure. The drop-off points on the way back were flexible, and we ended up near Jackson Square. It was nice to spend the rest of the afternoon wandering around the French Quarter.", "We have visited twice for brunch and loved it. The food is delicious, especially the grits with scallions and sour cream. Just remember to bring a sweater because the room is always cold.", "I love this place so much! They have the best hot dogs and chili dogs. I try to come here as often as possible because they are so delicious. Yum!", "Sweet spot in the Waterline! Came for some live music with friends on Saturday and was blown away. The ambiance was electrifying, the best local beer in town by far. The concept is a cut above Fig Mountain - Topa is the clear winner. Even cooler, you can savor delectable dishes from the Nook Restaurant and simply walk two feet into Lama Dog, seamlessly part of the Waterline experience. Absolutely love it!", "Excellent customer service experience! Even though we were slightly outside their pick-up range, the staff was very accommodating and picked up our group of 7. Upon arrival, we noticed that we were wrongly charged for 8 people instead of 7. I promptly called, and they quickly refunded the extra ticket cost. \n\nThe tour itself was incredibly enjoyable! We had a fantastic time, laughing and smiling throughout, thanks to our funny and engaging tour guide. We were thrilled to spot numerous alligators, from adorable baby ones swimming in the water to impressive full-grown specimens. Additionally, we saw turtles and various bird species during the tour. Our guide even had a baby alligator that we could hold; he is caring for it until it grows a bit more as it was a late hatchling that would not have survived on its own. \n\nThe return trip was just as exciting, with the guide treating us to a thrilling speedboat ride and showcasing some impressive maneuvers. I wholeheartedly recommend this tour to everyone!", "Westfall replaced our roof in April and we are extremely satisfied with the whole process. They provided a high-quality roof, excellent communication, and great follow-up. We are very pleased that we selected this company to replace our roof.", "The food is tasty, affordable, and the staff is friendly. While it may not be the best place to dine in, the fast-food concept for vegan food is fitting. Though the buffalo bella dish is highly recommended, the Cheesesteak is preferred in my opinion. Additionally, make sure to order the sweet potato fries.", "The ramen is fine, nothing to write home about. Service is average. Decent spot for a fast meal, but wouldn't be the first choice. Visited twice already, might visit again.", "Satisfy your cravings with our trendy and delicious menu! Get there early to avoid the wait - it's definitely worth it for a truly satisfying experience!", "Enjoyed a delicious brisket sandwich with two sides and a drink for just 9.99! Such a great deal for some tasty barbecue. The sides were amazing too - potato casserole, creamed spinach, baked beans, and green beans!", "The food and service were absolutely fabulous! My only little wish is that they offered some vegetarian/vegan choices too. I'm already looking forward to my next visit!", "Delicious food, but let down by subpar customer service! Despite visiting three times, facing two unhelpful older waitresses made the experience less enjoyable. On the bright side, the owner is a delight to interact with!", "I discovered this great breakfast spot from a local on the plane to Nashville. They were right - the food was amazing and we didn't have to wait in line. I had a delicious corn pancake topped with bacon, salsa, and sour cream. This place is a must-visit whenever I return to the South!", "Upset about a detailing service appointment with Michael and partner Alex. Confusion over appointment details, shop closed on appointment day, Michael unreachable. Disappointed and frustrated by the experience.", "I experienced a myriad of occurrences during the process of relocating, necessitating supplementary services from this establishment. The individuals within this office exhibit superior skills and display admirable integrity. While I am inclined to offer further praise for the exceptional care they bestowed upon me, I am hesitant as they may have exceeded the bounds of their duties. I have no reservations in endorsing this office to even the most discerning individual, including my own mother.", "Last year, The Saint was our home base for a fabulous girls' trip, and let me tell you, it was an experience! The moment you step into the lobby, you can't help but be captivated by its charm. With a trendy bar and restaurant adding to the allure, it sets the scene for a perfect weekend getaway. The friendly staff made us feel right at home, setting the stage for what we thought would be a fantastic time.\nI arrived a few hours ahead of my friend to catch up on work. After a productive stint on my laptop, it was time for a quick errand run before her arrival. As we reunited, the mischief began, with dinner plans leading to laughter-filled evenings. However, our carefree atmosphere took a turn for the worse when we encountered a giant flying roach in our room. PANIC! Without missing a beat, I made a beeline for the front desk, demanding immediate action.\nAlthough the staff swiftly moved us to another room, the new space wasn't exempt from critter sightings. With spiders and other unwelcome guests, coupled with malfunctioning tech and missing light bulbs, the disappointment set in. By 3 am, I had made up my mind - we were out! Switching gears, I swiftly booked a room at my trusted refuge, The W, for the remainder of our stay.\nDespite their attempts to rectify the situation the next morning, the misadventures of the night were just too much. I stood my ground, requesting a full refund and bidding farewell to any future stays. Kudos to the accommodating staff member who tried to salvage the situation, but in this tale of hotel horrors, there was no turning back.", "If you're looking for a new door with only $35 or have leftover building supplies, the Green Project is the place to go. They offer affordable options and accept donations to prevent waste in landfills.", "This establishment is the worst I've ever been to. The bouncer was unnecessarily rude, and it seems like they believe they can mistreat people and overcharge just because they are located on Broadway. As a local resident, I have no intention of visiting again or recommending it to anyone.", "Had a fantastic lunch date with my girlfriend! The place was spotless and the food was absolutely delicious! It was also very reasonably priced. We're already looking forward to our next visit!", "The disappointing experience at the restaurant occurred on several fronts, as the food quality has significantly declined. A shared artichoke was evidently prepared in advance, resulting in a cold interior and overcooked flesh. A Greek salad was overdressed and lacking in flavor, seemingly sourced from pre-packaged ingredients. The grilled yellowtail was notably disappointing, being overcooked and of low quality, making it inedible. Despite the pleasant ambiance and good service, the subpar food renders this establishment unworthy of a visit. The restaurant must elevate its food quality to avoid becoming another undesirable tourist spot.", "Head to Milktooth for unique breakfast cocktails and a twist on traditional brunch dishes. Despite the unfamiliar items on the menu, you'll definitely enjoy your order. Expect a wait at this popular Indy brunch spot, typically about 30 minutes on weekends, but it's absolutely worth it. To help pass the time, grab a drink or pastry from their walk-up bar. Their menu evolves but timeless favorites include different versions of Dutch pancakes and a must-try raclette grilled cheese. Don't miss the michelada if you're opting for a boozy breakfast. If the weather's nice, opt for outdoor seating.", "The bar and staff at this place are incredible! They even gave us a room upgrade for our honeymoon, and the view was simply stunning. However, the room itself was not as impressive as we had expected, more like a standard Hilton room. We noticed some rust in the tub and weird stains on the tiles in the bathroom. Despite this, I would still give it 4 stars because the rest of the hotel was great! The staff was friendly and accommodating, although we found the valet parking a bit pricey, so we opted to park a few streets away. This was the only downside, in my opinion. Overall, I would recommend this place if you want to stay right in the heart of the bustling downtown area of St. Louis, surrounded by lots of cool bars and restaurants on a lively Friday night.", "I recently started the beginner's class at the studio, and I absolutely enjoyed it! The class had a great pace that kept me engaged throughout, and the movements, while not too challenging, pushed me beyond my limits in unexpected ways! I even worked up a sweat! After the session, I felt fantastic! The studio is pristine, and I appreciate the option to purchase some Beyond Organic food items there as well.", "Not sure why it took so long for us to find Lobster Haven, but we're glad we did! Started out at a chain lobster restaurant but were craving something more authentic. Friend suggested Lobster Haven, checked it online - reminded us of dining in Massachusetts. Service was excellent, quick, and friendly. They offer a huge variety of favorites. A must-visit for authentic New England seafood. They also sell live lobster and fresh seafood for you to cook at home.", "Fantastic happy hour with a fresh menu and delicious drinks, I wish I could visit every day if I had the time!", "Men's clubs is awesome, no doubt about it! All the barbers here have mad skills to make you look fly. I've been a regular for 3 years now and never had any issues, except for this one time when some guy tried to copy my cut. Shoutout to Tim for keeping it real and saying \"I can't give you the same style as Ryan.\" Thanks, Tim!", "We are frequent visitors to this restaurant because we truly enjoy the fresh food and excellent service it offers. We highly recommend this place to anyone who is a fan of sushi and hibachi dishes.", "Chickie's and Pete's offers a great atmosphere for enjoying sports and treating yourself to some tasty bites. While it may not be the absolute best food around, scoring a seat to savor some beer with crab fries and mussels red is a surefire way to have a fantastic time during a game or a visit to the stadiums. Personal favorites include the crab fries, mussels red (the white mussels can be a bit overwhelming with garlic), the zesty pull and peel shrimp, steamers, and if you're up for it, the blue crabs (a bit messy but worth it). The convenient sinks scattered throughout make it easy to clean up after you've had your fill of finger-licking meals. Overall, Chickie's and Pete's is an iconic spot in Philadelphia that promises a fun experience. I highly recommend giving it a try at least once. Just remember, during major sporting events, expect a full house and some rowdy patrons, so be prepared for a lively atmosphere! \ud83d\ude04", "Efficient and courteous. During the weekend. Quick repair of my mirror, but they simplified the process for me. I have utilized their services in Charlotte previously and had a positive experience as well.", "Nice pick at Union Station St. Louis! I tried the Ponchartrain (which the server mentioned was similar to Tilapia, though both were on the menu, so who knows why they have two names for the same fish). The Ponchartrain was tasty with mushrooms and a creamy sauce. We also had the shrimp cocktail and lump crab cake apps - they were okay, nothing extraordinary. The drinks and service were decent. We sat outside on the patio because the weather was lovely - the inside looked cozy and less laid-back.", "I stopped in for a drink yesterday and must say the atmosphere gets an A+ from me. It's a unique concept for the St. Pete area. The attention to detail in the remodel was outstanding; it almost feels like being in a Harry Potter movie. The background music is set at a low volume so you can easily hear your friends without shouting - perfect for the library-esque environment. Michael and Peggy were friendly and interesting bartenders. I didn't try the food, but the prices for meat and cheese trays are better than other places in the area. I highly recommend checking this place out.", "I thoroughly enjoy Maple Street Patisserie. It consistently surpasses my expectations, offering the finest blueberry muffin I have ever had. This establishment excels as a delightful spot for both breakfast and lunch, and is known for its specialty cakes, particularly during events like Mardi Gras where one can indulge in a traditional king cake. Notably, the proprietor, Ziggy, is a diligent individual who devotes long hours to crafting delectable baked goods. Maple Street Patisserie truly stands out as an exceptional dining destination.", "The Bourbon Black and Bleu burger I had was really good. It was cooked perfectly and very tasty. However, the wait time for our food was too long. Despite having a big party of 4 adults and 5 kids, it took over an hour to get our food, which was disappointing.", "Whenever we have out-of-town guests, Katie's is our go-to place. The variety of food is superb and reasonably priced. Whether you choose grilled oysters, shrimp and grits, Cuban sandwich, pizza, or soup & salad, you will not be disappointed. Daily specials feature local seasonal offerings. The service staff is friendly. On Sundays, arrive early to avoid a wait after church. Enjoy bottomless Mimosas!", "I stopped by Creole Creamery after the Zurich Classic golf tournament. It was warm and a bit humid, so I indulged in an ice cream cone. Luckily, I found a street parking spot. The cute and comfy interior and the vast ice cream selection caught my eye. After trying some unique flavors, I chose a scoop of cookie monster ice cream on a cone. It was just right - not too sweet. Creole Creamery is definitely worth a visit!", "I absolutely adore this place! I've been a regular here for a couple of years. It has a quirky charm, and while I may steer clear of the escargot for safety concerns, when it comes to indulging in plenty of sake, delicious rolls, and heaps of rice and sashimi, this place is top-notch. The youthful vibe, upbeat dance music, and abundance of sake keep drawing me back.", "We love everything we've tried so far, especially the Backyard Bowl. The portion sizes are generous and the ingredients are high-quality. Despite the crowd, the reasonable prices make it worth the wait.", "The service was acceptable, although it was somewhat intriguing due to the newness of the staff member. The food presentation was impressive; however, an enhancement could be made by including more rice or potato salad with the gumbo. The Sprite was flat, but it was not really necessary for the meal.", "This pancake place is decent, but it can be chaotic when it's busy. The pancakes are tasty but very sweet. The prices are reasonable, and they serve breakfast all day. Overall, it's a good option, but not extraordinary.", "AMAZING finds and EXCEPTIONAL staff! Absolutely IN LOVE with our discoveries and will WITHOUT A DOUBT return!!!", "We have been visiting this place since I was young. The staff has seen me and my children grow up. They are friendly, prompt, and provide excellent service. Yoli and Frank are outstanding employees. The food is fantastic! I particularly enjoy their shredded beef burrito and cheese crisp. Their Mexican dishes are truly authentic.", "The dine-in experience merits 2 stars, marred by unsatisfactory service and underwhelming ambiance. The cuisine, while acceptable, might warrant 3 stars if opted for takeout. Specifically, the lamb kebab I ordered proved adequate, albeit lacking in flavor enhancements such as sauces or garnishes.", "The premier Middle Eastern establishment in this vicinity! Exceptional and unwavering culinary offerings! Successfully pleases the palate!", "Oh man, I can't believe someone only gave this place one star! Let me tell ya, they have the absolute BEST cannoli in the city. Forget about Termini's, it's nowhere as good, and Isgro's is just too overhyped. My go-to spot for cannoli is Potito's, no questions asked. I always go there every Christmas Eve, and you can bet I'll keep going for the rest of my life. This year, I waited in line for TWO HOURS at Isgro's for tiramisu, but at Potito's, I just walked in and grabbed my bambino cannoli-stuffed cannoli. It's seriously as delicious as it sounds, believe me.", "I absolutely love this small, cozy restaurant that serves delicious and authentic Mexican food. Having grown up in Texas, I've had my fair share of Mexican meals at home, and I'm constantly on the lookout for good Mexican restaurants. El Limon in Pennsylvania is hands down the best I've ever been to! Their sopes, tostadas, enchiladas, fajitas, burritos, and fish tacos are all amazing and reasonably priced. The staff is friendly and attentive. The highlights for me are their homemade tamales and complimentary margaritas. I highly recommend bringing your whole family for a fantastic Mexican dining experience! \u00a1Ole!", "I rate this joint 4 stars as they have potential for 5 stars once they improve. The food quality is really good, with highlights being the Quaker (Chicken version), fries, onion rings, Spanakopita, Baklava, Signature Salad, and the (turkey) Greek Burger. The pizza could be better. With some improvements and maintaining high standards, this place is worth returning to.", "Planet Fitness is given four stars mainly because it operates 24 hours a day. It is considered the best bang for your buck in terms of affordability. The gym has a tanning bed, massage chairs, and a sculpt machine, all available for just $20 a month. Although it lacks motivation for bodybuilders as they are not frequent visitors, mostly attracting larger individuals, there is no discrimination intended. Despite the $9.99 plan which excludes the use of massage amenities and the inability to bring friends, all the staff members are polite and helpful.", "I was extremely let down when we arrived to eat at 2:15 on Saturday, only to be informed that the kitchen had already closed at 2. Despite their website stating \"Sat & Sun all day,\" it claims they are open until 5. I have reservations about establishments that are unable to handle basic details such as accurately reflecting their hours online. This lack of attention to detail raises doubts for me about their overall quality standards and attention to even minor aspects.", "These individuals consistently perform high-quality work within the agreed timeframe and offer a warranty for their services. I highly recommend them!", "Dine at this establishment a minimum of twice weekly. The servers consistently exhibit friendliness, and the cuisine is exceptional. I consistently depart satisfied and satiated.", "The newly renovated Carrow's Restaurant on Plumb and Kietzke is a delightful discovery. Its charming redwood beams and facades saved it from the wrecking ball. The cuisine was exceptional. My wife savored the tri-tip salad, featuring greens drizzled with a balsamic vinaigrette and complemented by four generous slices of medium-rare tri-tip and delectable potato \"croutons\" \u2013 crispy bits of heaven. I opted for the tri-tip and chicken combo, with sides of fresh corn salad and potato salad. The meal was so satisfying that we indulged in dessert \u2013 a rarity for me. The dessert options included lemon meringue, mud pie, apple pie, and ice cream. We delighted in the lemon meringue, featuring delicious meringue topping. The prices were very reasonable considering the high quality of food and overall experience. We have already recommended this gem to our local family and friends and look forward to returning soon. Impressive work by the team at Carrow's!", "Rebecca may not have been my Doula during childbirth, but she was a nurturing presence in our lives as the nanny to our firstborn daughter. As I navigated the challenges of pregnancy with our second child, Rebecca's advice and insights resonated deeply with me. Her candid yet compassionate nature made our conversations both comforting and enlightening. Her passion for supporting laboring women as a Doula shines through, and she approaches this role with grace and admiration. I wholeheartedly believe that Rebecca would be a valuable asset to your support team.", "I recently had my car tinted by Orange Tint and Tune and received exceptional service. They provide a car pick-up service for customers living within a 4-mile radius, which is incredibly convenient. My technician, Carlos, thoroughly explained all tint options and adjusted the grade to match the specific look I desired. This level of customer service truly warrants a 5-star rating. Not only was the receptionist delightful, but owner Dustin also personally followed up to ensure my satisfaction with the service.", "I spent three nights here for business purposes. The hotel is conveniently located near the airport, yet it's surprisingly quiet. The rooms are typical TownePlace Suite rooms equipped with a refrigerator, stove, and other amenities. The hotel is situated in a peaceful area with a mix of nearby hotels and office buildings. It's approximately a 20-minute drive to the downtown or university area and about 5-10 minutes away from the Pima Air Museum. While there aren't many dining options close by, there are a few fast food places and a delightful sandwich shop called Baggins within walking distance. The hotel staff was exceptionally friendly and accommodating. The breakfast offered is a standard continental spread with a few hot choices, and they also host a reception on weekday evenings. However, the food and beverages tend to run out quickly, so it's advisable to arrive early. Despite this, you could still consider it as an option for dinner. My only issue was that the supplies ran low shortly after the event started, leaving few soft drinks (no diet) available when I arrived 45 minutes into it. They could enhance the experience by keeping the refreshments well-stocked throughout the duration. Nonetheless, the rooms are pleasant, the beds are cozy, and the area is secure.", "We were diverted to Tampa and decided to drive to Orlando, stopping to eat at a local gem recommended by Yelp. They grill their steaks over oak and citrus wood for a delicious smoky flavor, a rare find. Our group enjoyed Tampa strip and ribeye steaks with sides of veggies and sweet potatoes. The reasonably priced wines and excellent service from Lisa made for a delightful experience. Definitely bookmarking this spot for a return visit!", "The owner of this location (and two others) reached out to me after my review. We had a great conversation, and I was impressed with his business approach. I revisited Saladworks twice and the service had greatly improved. The new summer salads are delicious!", "This is, without a doubt, the best deli in the entire United States! With an array of exciting options, choosing can be difficult. The Muffalata is a massive sandwich that can easily feed four, and it is incredibly delicious. For a lively experience, visit on Saturday or Thursday evenings when they feature live music. The daily specials are consistently excellent, and there is a variety of sides to select from, including mouthwatering chili, potato salad, and, of course, chips. Don't wait - visit now for a memorable dining experience!", "During our cross-country journey, my father and I visited Saguaro National Park as one of our initial stops. We had the pleasure of partaking in a guided tour led by Park Ranger Carolyn, whose exceptional passion and enthusiasm for her saguaro studies was evident throughout. Her extensive knowledge further enriched our experience, making both the tour and our interaction with Carolyn highly recommended.", "Ventured here following my spouse's return with a batch of their zesty lemon pepper wings. This joint offers an array of delectable flavors, spanning from the classics (like lemon pepper and mild) to unique New Orleans creations (such as yaka mein and noonie bird). Let's not forget about their beverages; the watermelon option is downright heavenly. The secret recipe is a mystery, but it's downright divine. While the location may not be the most upscale, the establishment is endeavoring to enrich the local community. Nestled in close proximity to the daiquiri spot, the area is surprisingly vibrant during daylight hours. I'd exercise caution about visiting solo at night, though. Be sure to give this spot a chance; you might even bump into Skip!", "Returning to my visit to the establishment known as Tom Jones, it is time for me to provide an updated appraisal. Upon my recent visit, I observed the absence of the peculiar ATM machine that limited cash withdrawals only for check applications. This machine is no longer present, as it used to be positioned near the restroom facilities. However, the trusty payphone still remains in that spot, a feature that I have always appreciated. Notably, there are now multiple ATM machines located at the front entrance for convenience.\n\nThe price of the renowned blue ribbon special has now been adjusted to $3.79. Despite this slight increase, it remains a worthwhile deal as it encompasses an array of items, including pancakes, 2 eggs, toast, sausage, bacon, juice, and coffee. During this visit, I dined with my children, and it was my daughter's preferred choice to visit Tom Jones, as she expresses a great fondness for the place. Our orders varied, encompassing blue ribbons, french toast, chicken dishes, club sandwiches, and baked potatoes, ensuring that each of us received our desired meal.\n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant was notably clear of any lingering smoke odors, and I must emphasize that I found it to be impeccably clean. The vibrant orange booths added a touch of nostalgia, evoking a sense of stepping back in time, further complemented by the presence of the classic payphone. The service at Tom Jones continues to be prompt and efficient, with each visit being greeted by a different yet capable waitress. The turnover of staff is impressive, indicating a diligent management team that stays on top of things and ensures a smooth operation.\n\nConsidering the significance of Tom Jones to my daughter, who holds it in high regard, I am inclined to elevate my rating from 4 stars to a perfect 5-star rating.", "I am an amateur athlete and first met Dr. Ferrel while playing softball. He witnessed my severe injury during a game and promptly provided treatment on the field by relocating my ankle. Following this, he advised me to visit his office for further treatment. Despite expressing my financial constraints as a single mother on a teacher's salary, I sought medical attention elsewhere. The physician I consulted predicted a lengthy recovery period before I could resume playing. Feeling disheartened, I eventually returned to Dr. Ferrel for help. True to his word, he not only treated me effectively but also facilitated a swift recovery within weeks instead of months. Through the years, Dr. Ferrel consistently achieved remarkable results in each of our sessions, solidifying his place as my hero.", "Attending their shows is always a delightful experience, offering a captivating and laid-back atmosphere. For an enjoyable evening with delicious fare at reasonable prices, this establishment is the perfect destination.", "I absolutely love In-N-Out! There's this irresistible craving for In-N-Out that hits you just right sometimes! What can I say? 4 patties, animal style, bro! Let's go! \ud83c\udf54\ud83c\udf89", "Cindy's is the best! Authentic food, fresh ingredients, and excellent service. A must-try for Mexican cuisine lovers.", "I've been eager to try Trust Me BBQ for over a year now. However, when I finally visited about 3 months ago, I waited in line for 10 minutes without service and ended up leaving. Despite this initial setback, I decided to give it another chance after reading reviews just to see what all the hype was about. The food turned out to be hit or miss, but the service was so poor that I doubt I'll be back. The person behind the counter showed no interest or friendliness, making me feel as though I was dealing with a vending machine. Even when we managed to place our order, he didn't pay attention and got the sides wrong, requiring us to correct him as he served us. I've decided I'll stick with Down to the Bone BBQ from now on. The pros were that the BBQ sauce was delicious, the macaroni salad was unique, and the pulled pork was moist. On the flip side, the chicken was as dry as a sheet of paper and essentially inedible even when paired with the BBQ sauce. The mac & cheese seemed like it had been sitting in a pan on the steam table for 2-3 days, and the collard greens lacked flavor.", "During my week-long stay in town, I stumbled upon this charming hidden gem. The pa nang chicken exceeded my expectations with its excellent flavor. Opting for a one-star spicy level, my dish arrived promptly. I will be sure to visit again in the future.", "This establishment skillfully integrates a variety of flavors from diverse ethnicities and culinary traditions to create unique and enticing recipes. While not explicitly marketed as a \"Mexican\" venue, it excels in crafting delectable margaritas and tequila-based beverages. Additionally, a newly opened wine bar adjacent to the main location offers a selection of specialty bottles and accommodates overflow patrons. Highly recommended are the on the rocks margaritas and house-made white or red sangria, making a visit to this restaurant a rewarding experience.", "This charming donut bakery is situated in one of Hermitage's oldest shopping centers, where Yeu, the owner, creates a delightful array of treats. Beyond the common popular donuts, he offers unique specialties like bacon-topped donuts, apple fritters, pigs in a blanket, breakfast pastries, kolaches, and the infamous doughssants \u2013 a scrumptious fusion of a donut and croissant. Priced at just $1.99 each, the doughssants are a steal, with regular donuts available for around $0.60 each. These sweet treats make the perfect gift for my children's school teachers, who are always delighted by them. And don't forget to enjoy a cup of coffee while you're here!", "We have thoroughly enjoyed attending various events, such as concerts, basketball games, and others, all of which have been a lot of fun. The local favorites served at these events are delicious as well.", "Great food! We tried three appetizers and five main dishes, and they were all fantastic. The prices are reasonable and the service is good. I would definitely come back many times!", "The service here has gotten worse. We used to come here all the time but now we go somewhere else. They've been really slow and keep forgetting about us.", "This was the worst chicken and rice plate I've ever had. I asked for no sauce on the chicken to keep it healthy, but when I got to my car, the bag was full of oil that had leaked out of the container. The dish was swimming in 5-7 tablespoons of oil, which was not what I expected or wanted to eat. It was really disappointing, especially since their slogan includes the word \"healthy.\" What a joke.", "Great experience purchasing a washer and dryer from Sears for my new home. Excellent selection, knowledgeable salespeople, timely delivery, and beyond expected service. Highly recommend!", "The food at this place is absolutely amazing! Not only is the service quick, but the staff is incredibly friendly as well. Every time I visit, I'm greeted with such warmth and hospitality when ordering.", "I had the opportunity to sample them at last. Their impressive craftsmanship was apparent in the remodel. I thoroughly enjoyed the mushroom cheese steak.", "The espresso here is absolutely phenomenal - it's truly the best! This is without a doubt my go-to spot for an amazing Americano. The staff is incredibly kind and welcoming, and the vibes are just so chill and relaxed. Plus, they offer unlimited WiFi access, so you can stay connected easily. While there are no power outlets available, the bathrooms and the whole place are consistently spotless - a total win!", "I decided to check out this place after hearing all the hype about their high ratings. However, the entire experience left much to be desired. Their website was pretty useless in terms of figuring out the menu beforehand. You had to select a location out of three options and then scroll all the way down to see brief, unhelpful descriptions with no prices listed. It was just a list like this: Roast Beef, Roast Beef Combo, Roast Pork, Roast Pork Combo, Baked Ham, Baked Ham Combo, Roast Turkey, Roast Turkey Combo, Broccoli Rabe, Broccoli Rabe Combo. There was no explanation of what a combo entailed (it's just cheese, in case you're wondering). Ironically, the table place card had more detailed descriptions than the website.\n\nUpon walking in, I noticed that the place leaned more towards being a bar than a restaurant, which was fine, but there were still tables. Not being able to decide, I opted for the roast beef and roast pork combos since they were reasonably priced at $6.85 each. The sandwiches arrived quickly, but the roast beef was cold while the roast pork was hot. It was puzzling how they could have such a temperature difference when served simultaneously; clearly, one had been sitting around. I asked for the roast beef to be reheated while I finished the roast pork, and although it was warmer upon return, it still felt a bit cold compared to the other sandwich. The waitress offered to replace it, but as I was pressed for time, I declined. \n\nThe sandwiches were disappointingly sparse on meat, but compensated for this by drowning them in excessive gravy, which made them unnecessarily messy and caused the bread to fall apart. The menu place card mentioned a \"wet meat\" option with less gravy, and I highly recommend choosing this to avoid overpowering the taste of the meat and maintaining the sandwich's structure.", "I ordered food to go from Village Whiskey, so I can't give a review of the restaurant itself. The Whiskey Burger costs $26 and is delicious if you like a greasy burger. It is very tender with great bacon and is quite large. I recommend it if you don't mind the high price. The Duck Fat fries are also very tasty.", "Spent $80 on a feast for the family, and it was absolutely worth it! The food was piping hot, and the orange chicken was hands down the best I've had in a long time. From now on, this will be our go-to spot for delicious Asian cuisine!", "I usually do my laundry at my boyfriend's place, but with family guests bringing in a lot of towels, sheets, and comforters, I needed to find a safe, clean, and welcoming laundromat. I was relieved to discover this facility, which is immaculate, well-lit, and staffed by incredibly friendly and helpful employees. The laundry and dryer worked impressively quickly, allowing me to finish 4 oversized loads (equivalent to about 8 regular loads) in under 2 hours! The amenities were top-notch, including security cameras, flat screen TVs, magazines, Wi-Fi, clean restrooms, and vending machines. This laundromat provides a fantastic environment for getting laundry done, offering plenty of machines without being overcrowded. I am thrilled to have found this gem. Thank you, LAUNDROMAT!", "We stopped by for a late-night dinner last night and, man, the prices were pretty steep. To save some money, both couples decided to share a plate (our server seemed a bit annoyed). The food was decent, but honestly, it wasn't worth the high prices. I have to give it to them though, the garlic bread they served before the meal was absolutely delicious! I could have easily filled up on just that. Overall, I don't think I'd go back there personally. Maybe it was just an off night, but there are so many other great dining options in the St. Louis area, so much competition!", "I stopped by a bustling restaurant to enjoy a delicious Haven burger during the Seahawks/Saints game today. The place was crowded, and I had to sit near the door. The burger I ordered was fantastic, and the restaurant quickly became busier as more people arrived. I had to navigate through a busy crowd to leave the place, indicating that it's a popular spot. I plan to revisit the Haven, perhaps for a less busy lunch on a Tuesday.", "I've only tried the vermicelli bowls because I've never had the Pho here. The vermicelli is a good size and the price is fair. If you live in the Alberta Ave neighborhood, this place is conveniently located and my orders are always ready in just 15 minutes - even on a Friday night.", "I tried the Chicken Marsala on the waiter's recommendation, but I was disappointed. The chicken was tough and dry, and the pasta was undercooked and clumped together with no flavor. My friend ordered the lasagne but didn't enjoy it; it was bland with only a thin layer of pasta. The service was lacking too - they cleared my other friend's plate while she was in the restroom, even though she wasn't finished. On the plus side, the atmosphere was great with live music, and I had a good time dancing with my husband. However, the food was terrible for the high price.", "This place is fantastic! It has a beautiful setting and is conveniently located near the Broad Street line with lots of street parking available. You can bring your own drinks. I've visited twice and loved everything I tried. My favorite dishes were the chaats, beef short ribs, lamb vindaloo, beet salad, breads/pickles, and chai. We always enjoyed sharing the chocolate cake for dessert, which was a hit with everyone. You can even pick up some beer to go from the nearby bar. We're definitely planning to return.", "My favorite restaurant serves delicious ceviche. The atmosphere is fun, and the service, especially from our server Alex, is friendly, attentive, and thoughtful.", "This store is fantastic! Everyone loves it! The salad bar offers fresh options, and they have a variety of ethnic foods to explore. Enjoy!", "Review: I ordered a delicious Mediterranean chicken shawarma, which had a good flavor and a generous amount of chicken in the pita. The food was prepared quickly and was ready for me when I arrived, showcasing good service. I definitely plan to revisit the next time I am in the area.", "I find this establishment to be quite delightful. The culinary offerings are of high quality, and the ambiance and service provided by the staff are truly pleasant. I highly recommend this dining option for individuals who follow both vegetarian and non-vegetarian diets.", "The service was a bit slow to start, but once we were in the swing of things, I was absolutely thrilled! The gumbo was simply amazing, and I couldn't get enough of the chicken & waffles. The staff was super friendly, and the location on Bourbon St was perfect for some great people watching!", "Earl's airport grab-and-go eateries offer a solid selection of sandwich choices, from turkey and tuna to the enticing Hawaiian. Today, the aroma of roast beef beckoned to me, sealing my decision. The sandwich arrived, brimming with a generous portion of tender beef, cooked to perfection and accompanied by cheddar cheese and a delectable horseradish sauce. For me, no need for lettuce or tomatoes; it's a culinary masterpiece as it stands. Conveniently located between the security checkpoint and the top of the D gates (just a stone's throw from the Delta SkyClub!), it's a quick and hassle-free option to enjoy at your gate or on the plane. Delicious!", "What an amazing experience! The food was outstanding, the service was exceptional, and the staff were very welcoming. The cheese curds appetizer with red pepper jelly was a hit, and both the fish tacos and beer brat for dinner were delicious. The portion sizes were generous, and the prices were reasonable. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable, and the manager checked in to make sure we were happy.\n\nI mentioned to the manager that I had discovered a new favorite spot and he told us about their game day specials and weekend brunch. As we left, the staff bid us farewell and offered us root beer candies. I'm definitely planning to return!", "I dropped by to have dinner and a drink, and I was very satisfied with my experience! Normally, I don't order burgers when eating out because I can easily make them at home. However, after trying the burger here, I'll have a tough time not ordering it again. In addition to the delicious food, they offer a good selection of beers, and the friendly wait staff and bartenders made me feel welcome. My meal was cooked exactly as I requested and was served promptly. The restaurant has a pleasant ambiance, and the restrooms were well-maintained. Overall, I left feeling very pleased with my visit."]
