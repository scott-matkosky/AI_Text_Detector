["Imagine you're part of a group that's making a dangerous device, like a firebomb. Just being involved in making something like that can put you in harm's way. The thing is, there's no good reason to make a bomb - they're only meant to cause harm. If you're caught making or having a bomb, you could face serious charges and a longer sentence. This is because bombs are considered violent crimes, and the law takes them very seriously.\n\nIn fact, courts have ruled that having a bomb is a violent crime because there's no peaceful reason to have one, and it's likely to be used to hurt someone or damage property. This means that if you're involved in making or having a bomb, you could face serious consequences.", "Colameta misappropriated customer information from Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and took at least two proposals with him to Monument. This stolen information may qualify as trade secrets, which are defined by Massachusetts law as any confidential or proprietary business information that provides a competitive advantage, including scientific, technical, or management information, designs, processes, or formulas (G.L.c. 266, \u00a730). Even if the information doesn't meet the strict definition of a trade secret, it may still be entitled to protection as confidential and proprietary business information (Warner-Lambert Co., 427 Mass. at 49). Notably, this type of information is only protected if it is not publicly known or generally available (Augat, Inc., 409 Mass. at 173).", "In a property tax sale, it is essential to understand the priority of liens. As noted in Taylor v. Mill (310 S.C. 526, 528, 426 S.E.2d 311, 312, 1992), Section 6323(b)(6) grants a county's tax lien priority over a federal lien. This means that when Taylor purchased the property, it was still subject to the county's lien.\n\nThis Court has previously established that Section 6323 determines priority, not extinguishment. Therefore, potential buyers must research tax sale property purchases and be aware of any federal tax liens. Failure to do so may stifle tax sales.\n\nAppellants argue that the master erred by not giving priority to Section 6323, a more specific statute, over Section 7425, a general statute. This is a correct application of the law, as stated in Capco of Summerville, Inc. v. J.H. Gayle Constr. Co. (368 S.C. 137, 142, 628 S.E.2d 38, 41, 2006).", "The defendants also point to Oswego Laborers' Local 214 Pension Fund v. Marine Midland Bank, a 1995 case that says a plaintiff has to show that the issue affects a lot of consumers, not just a few. But as we've already explained, our complaint shows that the defendants' unauthorized use of the Del Monico's name for non-Ocinomled restaurants and products hurt consumers and the public at large. This is because it was likely to cause confusion among consumers. Other cases, like CommScope, Inc. of N.C. v. Commscope (U.S.A.) Int'l Grp. Co. and New York City Triathlon, LLC v. NYC Triathlon, support this idea.", "Although Mr. Norwood's request for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) was denied, he still has valid concerns about the fairness of his sentence. While he acknowledges that the guideline range wouldn't have changed, he argues that the district court made a mistake by not letting the jury decide certain key issues. We understand his frustration, but unfortunately, the law doesn't allow him to raise these concerns through a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. This type of motion is only meant to address sentence reductions resulting from changes to the sentencing guidelines, not to revisit other aspects of the sentence. As the courts have consistently held, including in United States v. Price and United States v. Gay, the scope of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is limited to the specific guideline range in question.", "In accordance with established precedent, including United States v. 887 (9th Cir. 1991), United States v. Ramirez, 770 F.2d 1458, 1461 (9th Cir. 1985), and United States v. Manfredi, 722 F.2d 519, 522 (9th Cir. 1983), it is essential to recognize that the distinction between misdemeanors and felonies is often irrelevant in situations involving dangerous individuals. Unfortunately, law enforcement officers have been killed during traffic stops for minor infractions, highlighting the importance of this consideration.\n\nHowever, the facts of this case are disputed, and it is imperative that these disputed facts be submitted to the jury, even when qualified immunity from suit is at issue. As the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution clearly stipulates, issues of credibility are the purview of the trier of fact. This principle is succinctly articulated in Thompson v. Mahre, 110 F.3d 716, 719 (9th Cir. 1997), and further supported by Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304, 317-18, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995).\n\nRegarding LaLonde's claims of excessive force, I...", "At its core, Landowners contend that Star Enterprise's negligent actions have hindered their capacity to enter into agreements with third parties for the sale of their properties, resulting in damages similar to those addressed by the Virginia Supreme Court in Philip Morris, which established a physical impact requirement. Landowners cite Pruitt v. Allied Chemical Corp. (523 F.Supp. 975, E.D.Va.1981) to support their argument that Virginia law allows for compensation for purely economic losses in the absence of direct physical harm. In Pruitt, the plaintiffs were individuals who earned a living from marine life in the Chesapeake Bay, which was allegedly polluted by chemicals discharged into the Bay by the defendant. The federal district court, interpreting Virginia law, ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. This ruling is consistent with other cases, including Union Oil Co. v. Oppen (501 F.2d 558, 9th Cir.1974) and Burgess v. M/V Tamano (370 F.Supp. 247).", "In a groundbreaking ruling, the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals declared that insurance policies are an integral part of a bankruptcy estate, a principle that has been upheld for decades. (Cas. and Sur. Co., 435 F.3d 252, 260 (3d Cir.2006)) This landmark decision was reinforced by a string of subsequent cases, including Estate of Lellock v. The Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 811 F.2d 186, 189 (3d Cir.1987), In re Louisiana World Exposition, Inc., 832 F.2d 1391, 1399 (5th Cir.1987), and In re SN Liquidation, Inc., 388 B.R. 579, 583-584 (Bankr.D.Del.2008), which unequivocally stated that insurance policies purchased and paid for by a debtor are, in fact, property of the estate. This notion was further solidified by In re World Health Alternatives, Inc., 369 B.R. 805, 809 (Bankr.D.Del.2007), and In re A (Bankr.E.D.N.Y.1999), which echoed the same sentiment. However, it's worth noting that In re Circle K Corp., 121 B.R. 257 (Bankr.D.Ariz.1990), presented a contrasting view. 31. For further insight, see In re Allied Digital, 306 B.R. at...", "It's intriguing that Georgia's traditional K-12 schools don't seem to offer the same innovative approach as CCAT, with its year-round program, multi-age classrooms, and student-centered learning based on constructivist and multiple intelligence theories. What makes this curriculum so unique that it deserves to be considered 'special'? The majority doesn't provide clear answers. If a 'special school' only needs to differ slightly from a regular local school, then couldn't the Charter Schools Commission create a variety of charter schools that would pass constitutional muster? Even if the three charter schools in question don't quite meet the mark, it's possible that the majority is mistaken in striking down the 2008 Act entirely. As we've seen in cases like Blevins, the normal course of constitutional review suggests that...", "The Florida Legislature established the State Risk Management Trust Fund as a self-insurance program to provide liability insurance coverage to government agencies and employees in civil rights cases, as outlined in Section 284.30 of the Florida Statutes. This statute requires that when a party seeks attorney's fees from a state agency, they must serve notice on the Department of Financial Services (DFS) along with a copy of the pleading claiming the fees. On appeal, N.S. argues that a parent involved in a dependency proceeding does not meet the statutory definition, which states that the fund is designed to provide insurance to state agencies through a risk management program administered by DFS. While the courts have previously addressed this issue (see 1st DCA 1987), they have not specifically ruled on whether this provision applies to parents in dependency proceedings.", "In a dramatic turn of events, the merits of the motions in question were initially rendered moot by the trial court's order, only to be revived when this Court vacated the new trial order. However, the majority's opinion effectively decided those motions while retaining jurisdiction over the proceedings, inadvertently rendering the pending motions for entry of judgment on the verdict and entry of JNOV moot. According to the mootness doctrine, this Court lacks the authority to issue a judgment or opinion on these now-moot motions. But here's the twist: when this Court vacated the trial court's order granting a new trial, the trial court regained jurisdiction over the case, pending the entry of a final judgment. As the Texas Supreme Court ruled in In re Baylor Med. Ctr. at Garland, 'the trial court retains jurisdiction over the case until entry of final judgment.' (280 S.W.3d 227, 230-32, 2008). And now, this Court's judgment takes center stage...", "The court doesn't think that the pretrial publicity or prejudice would require moving the trial to a different location. Additionally, the court believes that Johnson gave up her right to request a change of venue because she didn't bring it up again after the jury selection process. During this process, the court looked at the potential jurors' answers to determine if they could be fair and impartial. If the court decides that there's no reason to assume prejudice before the trial, it will look at the jurors' answers to decide if a change of venue is needed.", "In a bizarre twist, the female robber claimed she had no recollection of strong-arming the store clerk for cash, instead blaming her partner in crime for giving the orders. But the clerk's eyewitness account told a different story, placing the female robber squarely at the scene of the crime, demanding money with an iron fist. In a desperate bid to deflect blame, she pointed to her inebriated state and hinted that her accomplices had coerced her into participating. However, this convenient excuse didn't quite add up, as it's possible she was trying to downplay her role in the heist to avoid taking the fall. As the courts have previously ruled, a statement can't be considered reliable simply because it's part of a larger confession, especially when it shifts the blame onto someone else.", "When it comes to sentencing for bank robbery, the court can impose sentences consecutively or concurrently. However, there's a catch. The statute doesn't allow the court to decide whether a future sentence will be consecutive or concurrent to previous sentences. Instead, when sentences are given at different times, the court can only decide whether to make them consecutive or concurrent if the defendant is already serving a sentence that hasn't been completed.\n\nIn other words, there must be an existing sentence at the time the district court imposes its sentence. The court can't impose a sentence consecutively to a sentence that doesn't exist yet. This interpretation is supported by well-reasoned cases from other circuits. For example, see Romandine v. United States (2000) and United States v. Quintero (1998).", "The plan to fix the site was finalized in September 1991. Later, in September 1997, a lawsuit was filed to get back the costs of cleaning up the site. The court had to decide if the initial installation of wells was a cleanup action that would start the six-year time limit for filing a lawsuit. The plaintiff argued that no cleanup could happen until the final plan was officially approved. However, the court disagreed and instead looked at how close the action was to when the final cleanup plan was revealed, which might be before the plan was officially approved.", "When someone reports discrimination at work, the law protects them from being punished or fired because of it. In this case, Jiles claimed he was fired because he reported racial discrimination in May 2006. However, the court found that there was no clear connection between Jiles' report and his termination eight months later in January 2007. The court decided that eight months was too long of a time period to prove that Jiles was fired because of his report. We agree with the court's decision.", "To determine if one crime is a lesser included offense of another, you need to compare the definitions of the two crimes. The lesser crime must have all its essential elements included in the greater crime. If the lesser crime has an essential element that is not fully covered by the greater crime, then it is not a lesser included offense.", "As McColman astutely observes, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(b)(2) stipulates that when an issue not raised in the pleadings is tried with the parties' express or implied consent, it shall be treated as if it were originally pleaded. Furthermore, a party may move to amend the pleadings at any time, even after judgment, to conform them to the evidence and raise an unpleaded issue. Notably, the failure to amend does not impact the outcome of the trial of that issue. However, a closer examination of Rule 15(b)(2) reveals that it only applies to claims that are actually tried, which is not the case here, as this matter was disposed of via summary judgment. Moreover, Doan explicitly objected to the handcuffing claim in both his motion for summary judgment and during oral argument, thereby withholding his consent to try the claim. This is consistent with the holding in Siler v. Webber, 448 Fed.Appx. 50, 58 (6th Cir.2011). It is also worth noting that Doan would not have been...", "Imagine a world where speaking out against injustice is met with retaliation. Thankfully, the law protects individuals who dare to challenge unlawful practices. As stated in the chapter, \"No person shall discriminate against any individual because they opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter or because they made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this chapter.\" (emphasis added)\n\nBut here's the catch: an employer can't be held accountable for retaliating against an employee unless they knew the employee was engaging in protected opposition. As the court ruled in Petersen, 301 F.3d at 1188, \"An employer's action against an employee cannot be because of that employee's protected opposition unless the employer knows the employee has engaged in protected opposition.\"\n\nIn Mr. Jones' case, he must prove that UPS knew he was engaging in protected activity when they refused to return him to work. The court has set a high bar for establishing causation, as seen in Williams v. Rice, 983 F.2d 177, 181 (10th Cir.1993). To succeed, Mr. Jones must demonstrate a clear link between his protected actions and UPS's decision. The question is, can he meet this burden of proof?", "It's unlikely that the defendant was prejudiced by the change to the present tense when his response to Mr. Falvey's question is considered in context. The defendant's use of the past tense appears to be a slip of the tongue, as he was responding to a present-tense question and began his answer with \"currently.\" Moreover, his lawyer elicited testimony from Lieutenant Commander Donald Ray Opedal that the defendant claimed to be unemployed at the August 9, 1985 meeting. The court also instructed the jury that counsel's arguments were not evidence and that their recollection of the evidence controlled, as supported by United States v. Ashworth and United States v. Sarmiento.", "Let's set the record straight! We're talking about a bold move to offset the alimony award by the exact amount the defendant swiped from the plaintiff. And we're not alone in recognizing that alimony and equitable distribution are two distinct yet interconnected forms of relief. The trial judge was on the same page!\n\nBut here's the kicker: the equitable maxim of unclean hands is a game-changer in matrimonial cases. As the court ruled in Heuer v. Heuer, this principle gives judges the discretion to call out dirty tricks. And let's be clear: if you're coming to court, you'd better come correct! As the court stated in Chrisomalis v. Chrisomalis, \"a party in equity must come into court with clean hands and... must keep them clean... throughout the proceedings.\" This isn't a suggestion, it's a requirement!\n\nThe courts have consistently upheld this principle, from A. Hollander & Son, Inc. v. Imperial Fur Blending Corp. to Thompson v. City of Atlantic City. So, if you're thinking of playing dirty, think again! The law is clear: clean hands only, please!", "According to the Supreme Court in Inc. (1974), federal questions must be explicitly stated in the complaint itself, without relying on the answer or removal petition. As established in Gully v. First Nat\u2019l Bank (1936), federal jurisdiction cannot be based on a federal defense. This principle was reaffirmed in Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams (1987), which held that a case cannot be removed to federal court solely on the basis of a federal defense. Furthermore, federal jurisdiction cannot be established through a counterclaim, as ruled in Holmes Group v. Vornado Air Circulation Sys., Inc. (2002).", "In a landmark decision, the Supreme Court's ruling in Alleyne v. United States, 227, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999), was applied retroactively, vacating Pizarro's sentence and ordering resentencing. Notably, this development occurred after Pizarro had submitted his opening brief in his third appeal. The Supreme Court's subsequent denial of Pizarro's petition for a writ of certiorari in Pizarro-Morales v. United States, 546 U.S. 1199, 126 S.Ct. 1397, 164 L.Ed.2d 99 (2006), does not alter the fact that Pizarro's conviction was not yet final at the time of the Alleyne decision, given the prior vacation of his sentence and remand for resentencing. This is consistent with established precedent, as seen in Berman v. United States, 302 U.S. 212, 58 S.Ct. 164 (1937), and Mercer v. Theriot, 377 U.S. 152, 153, 84 S.Ct. 1157, 12 L.Ed.2d 206 (1964), which hold that a conviction is not final if the sentence is vacated.", "In a recent case, the court ruled that pension-plan proceeds remain exempt from creditors even after the beneficiary receives them, as per the Wisconsin statute. However, this ruling is not applicable to the current matter due to significant differences in the exemption statute.\n\nDespite the clear language of \u00a7 522(d)(10), the debtor argues that exempt pension plan funds rolled over into an IRA should retain their exemption status, citing \"equitable\" considerations. However, as established in In re Clark, a debtor's exemption rights are governed by statute, and none of the statutory provisions support this claim.\n\nIn contrast, In re Donaghy presents a differing opinion on this matter. Nevertheless, the debtor has failed to provide any evidence to support their argument, leaving the statutory provisions as the guiding authority.", "The court found that no physician had ever described the claimant, Reynolds, as obese or suggested that her weight had worsened her existing medical conditions. As a result, even if Reynolds' failure to mention her weight did not automatically exclude it from consideration, there was no evidence available for the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) to review regarding the impact of obesity on her condition.\n\nFurthermore, the ALJ did not err in assessing Reynolds' credibility. As the judge who directly observed the witness's demeanor, the ALJ was in the best position to evaluate her credibility. According to established case law, including Walters v. Commissioner of Social Security (127 F.3d 525, 531, 6th Cir. 1997), an ALJ's credibility assessment is given significant deference and will not be overturned unless there is a compelling reason to do so. This is supported by Smith v. Halter (307 F.3d 377, 379, 6th Cir. 2001), which emphasizes the importance of the ALJ's firsthand observation in making a credibility determination. In social security cases, the ALJ's evaluation of a claimant's credibility is a critical aspect of the decision-making process.", "To qualify for special treatment under the Bankruptcy Code, a car loan must be taken out by a debtor and made within 910 days of filing for bankruptcy. This case was filed after October 17, 2005, when the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA) took effect. All references to statutes in this case refer to BAPCPA, unless otherwise noted. The court uses a formula to determine the interest rate, taking into account the risk of nonpayment. According to Section 1325(a), certain requirements must be met. Previous court cases, such as In re Billings and In re Horn, have established important precedents in this area.", "In the medical records, there is no evidence of any potential medical treatment that Monroe County or the individual defendants could have provided to save the life of the deceased. Phillips argues that she does not need to prove that chemotherapy would have saved the deceased's life. However, she misunderstands the issue of causation. While in a survival action, damages for the deceased's physical suffering and mental anxiety due to delayed medical care would be relevant, in a wrongful death case, the plaintiff must first establish a causal link between the alleged negligence and the death before seeking damages. As established in Wilks v. American Tobacco Co. (680 So.2d 839, 842, Miss. 1996), the plaintiff must clear this causation hurdle. Furthermore, Phillips suggests that she only needs to...", "In light of the evidence, it's clear that the second Olano prong has been met: the mistake - both the lack of a jury verdict on a crucial aspect of the offense and the omission of that element from the indictment - was glaringly obvious. \n\nNext, we need to consider whether this obvious error impacted Thomas's fundamental rights. According to the courts, an error affects a defendant's substantial rights if it's prejudicial and influenced the outcome of the trial. As stated in Gore (154 F.3d at 47), this means the error must have had a tangible impact on the proceedings. \n\nWhile the concept of prejudice is also relevant in determining whether an error is harmless under Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a), the key distinction here is that the burden of proof falls on the defendant, not the prosecution. This is supported by rulings in United States v. Vazquez (271 F.3d 93, 100-01, 3d Cir. 2001) and United States v. Terry (240 F.3d 65).", "As a dedicated special education teacher, she's finally taking the first steps towards achieving her dream career. But despite her hard work, she's facing an uphill battle. The allegations against her are piling up, and it's clear that she's still suffering from ongoing harm. That's why she's fighting for injunctive relief - she wants the individuals responsible to take action and change her grade, allowing her to continue her studies at Hunger College. This isn't about dwelling on past mistakes; it's about taking proactive steps to prevent future harm. As the courts have consistently ruled, prospective relief is necessary to address the lingering effects of past injuries. By granting this injunction, we can ensure that she's given a fair chance to succeed, and that her future is brighter than her past.", "The court's decision is supported by previous cases, including Gibbs v. Gibbs (1996). In contrast, the Straney case cited by the dissenting opinion is different because it involved a change in the time-sharing arrangement, not a change in custody. To modify a custody order, two conditions must be met: there must be a significant change in circumstances, and the change must be in the best interest of the child. The party seeking the modification has a heavy burden of proof to show both of these conditions are met. The trial court failed to apply this strict standard in this case.", "N.C. App. & T.J.B.

United States (1986). Premier fully participated in the review and has no control over its suppliers' cooperation. According to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b), adverse inferences can be used when an interested party fails to cooperate, but Premier's suppliers are not considered interested parties. Therefore, the Court will not apply adverse facts to Premier due to its suppliers' deficiencies, as supported by Kompass Food Trading Int'l v. United States (2000).", "In order to establish a violation of a constitutional right, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation. As stated in Anderson v. Creighton (1987), an official should understand that their actions violate this right. The burden of proof lies with the plaintiff to show that the right was clearly established before the defendant took or failed to take action. This is supported by Rice v. Burks (1993), which cites Rakovich v. Wade (1988).\n\nTo meet this burden, the plaintiff must provide either a closely analogous case or evidence that the defendant's conduct is so blatantly unconstitutional that any reasonable official would recognize it as such, without needing guidance from the courts. This is further explained in Rice (1993) and McDonald v. Haskins (1992). The key question is whether qualified immunity applies in such cases.", "In the grand scheme of things, any potential bias against the Defendant was negligible and could have even been leveraged to their advantage by their legal team. Even if some prejudice did occur, it was an isolated incident that didn't have a lasting impact on the trial's outcome. In fact, it only appears once in the transcript and was never brought up again. As the courts have previously established, a single mistake doesn't necessarily taint the entire trial. See United States v. Beckett, where it was ruled that 'prosecutorial misconduct, although unfortunate, doesn't automatically warrant an appeal unless it directly contributed to the guilty verdict.' Similarly, in United States v. Bermea, the court held that [insert holding]. Given this, the argument for a new trial based on this ground doesn't hold much water.", "In the absence of timely objections, the court will promptly render a judgment based on the referee's report. \n\nNotably, an amended order was issued on December 22, 2009, to rectify a typographical error.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that prejudgment interest awarded to a successful defendant on a counterclaim accrues from the date the counterclaim is filed, not the plaintiff's complaint. This principle is clearly illustrated in Uncle Henry's, Inc. v. Plaut Consulting, Inc. (382 F.Supp.2d 150, 154 (D.Me.2005)), which interprets 14 M.R.S. \u00a7 1602-B(5) (2009).\n\nHowever, we have established an exception to this general rule in the context of post-judgment interest on certain child support arrearage claims, which are considered a unique area of the law. This exception is exemplified in Walsh v. Cusack (2008 ME 74, \u00b6 9, 946 A.2d 414, 417).\n\nFor further insight, see Walsh (2008 ME 74, \u00b6\u00b6 10-11, 946 A.2d at 417-18), which provides a detailed analysis of this exception, as well as Tarbuck v.

As noted by several courts and commentators, the discussion of separation of powers was not an independent rationale, but rather part of the Section 5 analysis. For example, Guerrero (290 F.3d at 1219-20) and Kikumura (242 F.3d at 958-59) both emphasize the importance of reading the language in context. Similarly, Gregory P. Magarian's article (99 Mich. L.Rev. 1903, 1914, 2001) supports this conclusion. Therefore, the court concludes that", "The Supreme Court has consistently held that searches and seizures inside a home without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable (States Dist.

However, the Court has established exceptions to the warrant requirement in cases where \"special needs, beyond the normal need for law enforcement, make the warrant and probable-cause requirement impracticable\" (New Jersey v. T.L.O., 469 U.S. 325, 351, 105 S.Ct. 733, 83 L.Ed.2d 720, 1985). For example, the Court has allowed school officials to conduct warrantless searches of student property without probable cause (New Jersey v. T.L.O., 1985). Similarly, in O'Connor v. Ortega (480 U.S. 709, 107 S.Ct. 1492, 94 L.Ed.2d 714, 1987), the Court held that [insert holding]. Additionally, in Griffin v.

By not opting out, the class member is essentially agreeing that the class certification is proper. Courts have consistently ruled that if a class member doesn't opt out, they can't later argue that the class doesn't have adequate representation. This is because the right to opt out protects class members' interests from alleged inadequate representation.", "The distinction between the debtor's name and the name used to file a security interest appears to be insignificant under Section 409.402(7) of the statutes. However, in other contexts, a properly perfected security interest can become unperfected if the creditor fails to take action. For example, Section 409.103(l)(d)1, (2)(b), and (3)(e) of the statutes provide four-month grace periods to preserve perfection in collateral removed from jurisdiction. Additionally, Section 409.403(2) states that financing statements lapse after five years unless continued.\n\nNotably, the Ansley court ruled that filing a security interest under the name \"Ansley Farms\" instead of the debtor's true name, \"Emory Ansley\", is seriously misleading and renders the security interest unperfected. Similar rulings can be found in other cases, such as In Re Wishart (10 U.C.C. Rep. Serv. 1296, Bankr. W.D. Mich. 1972) and In Re Brawn (7 U.C.C. Rep. Serv. 565, D.C.).", "The agreement's language is key. As the court in Hymel emphasized, the contractual rate of interest only applies if it explicitly covers both pre- and post-judgment periods. Otherwise, it would conflict with the merger rule. In fact, experts note that to \"contract out\" of statutory post-judgment interest rates, the language must specifically reference the post-judgment period (Reisberg & Pauley, 2013 Int'l Arb. L.Rev. 25, 29-30). This is consistent with Carte Blanche (888 F.2d at 264, 268-70) and Hosier v.

As established in precedent, including Yamada v. Nobel Biocare Holding AG (275 F.R.D. 573, 578 (C.D.Cal.2011)), where it was held that consistently made alleged omissions and affirmative misrepresentations are common to all members of the putative class, and Wiener v. Dannon Co. (255 F.R.D. 658, 669 (C.D.Cal.2009)), which stated that an inference of reliance arises as to the entire class only if material misrepresentations were made to all class members, as well as Negrete v.

Voluntary abandonment of this purpose after taking action does not constitute a defense. \n\nHistorically, the definition of an attempt to commit a crime has been outlined in the 1928 and 1949 Manuals for Courts-Martial, U.S. Army, as follows: an act done with the intent to commit a particular crime, which forms part of a series of acts that would likely result in the crime's actual commission if not interrupted by circumstances beyond the individual's control.\n\nNotably, the Articles for the Government of the Navy did not have a general statutory prohibition on attempts, but such actions were often punishable as lesser-included offenses. For example, Section 91 of the Naval Courts and Boards (1937) addresses this issue. According to naval law, if an attempt is not...", "**Determining Voluntary Consent to a Search**\n\n* The court must consider the \"unique facts and circumstances of each case\" to determine if an individual voluntarily consented to a search (Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 233, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973)).\n* The district court's analysis of the facts changed between its first and second orders, leading to a finding of constitutionally deficient consent only when considering an unlawful seizure.\n* The court properly considered the legal effect of the officer's lie about the drug dog alerting when determining if Loos and Escobar voluntarily consented to the searches of their luggage.\n* The Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of considering the specific circumstances of each case, noting that \"even when...there is a vast difference between...\" (Holding, 86, 1191 (8th Cir.1992)).", "Let's talk about \u00a7 6323(a), which is a special leave benefit that only applies to military personnel. The cases the Defendants are referencing actually involve employers who voluntarily offered extra perks to military personnel on leave. While courts have consistently ruled that employers can take away these extra benefits without violating USERRA, these cases don't apply to the statutory rights that USERRA provides. For example, in Crews v. City of Mt. Vernon, the court said it was okay for an employer to cancel a flexible work scheduling program. Similarly, in Gross v. PPG Industries, Inc., the court ruled that an employer could stop paying differential pay without violating USERRA. And in Welshans v. U.S. Postal Service, the court came to a similar conclusion. The point is, there's just no logical argument that...", "According to the Supreme Court's ruling in Sinclair, Louis, Siegel, Heath, Nussbaum & Zavertnik, P.A. v. Baucom (428 So.2d 1383, 1385, Fla. 1983), a valid charging lien requires timely notice. To achieve this, an attorney should either file a notice of lien or pursue the lien in the original action. This is supported by Daniel Mones, P.A. v. Smith (486 So.2d 559, 560, Fla. 1986), which cites Sinclair, Louis.\n\nNotice is considered timely if the charging lien is filed before the entry of the final judgment, as seen in Gaebe, Murphy, Mullen & Antonelli v. Bradt (704 So.2d 618, Fla. 4th DCA 1997). On the other hand, an attorney's charging lien is deemed untimely and cannot be established if filed after the final judgment has been entered, as held in Milio v. Leinoff & Silvers, P.A.

Therefore, we overrule appellant's third and fourth issues.\n\nRegarding appellant's fifth and sixth issues, he argues that the method of seizure violates the constitutional prohibitions on ex post facto laws, as outlined in U.S. Constitution Article I, Section 10, Clause 1 and Texas Constitution Article I, Section 16. However, ex post facto prohibitions only apply to civil statutes when the statutory scheme is punitive in purpose or effect, effectively transforming a civil remedy into a criminal penalty. As stated in Rodriguez, 93 S.W.3d at 67, this is not the case here. Furthermore, forfeitures under Chapter 59 of the Code of [insert relevant code or statute] do not constitute a criminal penalty.", "The Plaintiff's attempt to rely on prior settlement discussions as a basis for a viable amendment is fundamentally flawed. The Court rejects this misguided effort, and for good reason. At the time of these discussions, the Plaintiff had the opportunity to amend her administrative claim, as the INS had not yet denied her claim. In fact, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675(a) explicitly permits such amendments. Yet, the Plaintiff chose not to take advantage of this opportunity.\n\nFurthermore, the Plaintiff's assertion that the Defendant bears the burden of proving that her injury was not reasonably foreseeable at the time of her administrative claim is a clear misinterpretation of the law. It is well established that the burden of proving \"newly discovered evidence\" under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675(b) rests squarely on the Plaintiff's shoulders. This is not a matter of debate, as the courts have consistently held in cases such as Milano v. United States and Lowry. The Plaintiff's failure to acknowledge this fundamental principle of law undermines the credibility of her entire argument.", "Take a Stand Against Unfair Decisions: Know Your Rights!\n\nAre you dissatisfied with a decision made by an officer, board, commission, authority, or tribunal?

As stated in Super. Ct. R. 15(a), this process is your right. In fact, the court has upheld this right in cases such as Dept. of Property and Procurement, 41 V.I. 72 (Terr.Ct. 1999), citing In re Hodge, 16 V.I. 548, 555 (Terr.Ct.).

(See Exhibit M, page 12.) Additionally, the appellee distributed brochures at New Jersey campgrounds. (Id. at 15.) To obtain a brochure without visiting New Jersey, one would need to initiate contact with the appellee through a written inquiry.

(805 P.2d 1186, 1188, Colo.Ct.App.1991), we find precedent for the current situation. The Plaintiffs have acknowledged the state claims against Cox, including misrepresentation, breach of contract, and estoppel. However, they have not conceded the remaining claims, which include intentional infliction of emotional distress and defamation. Given that Cox was required to take additional steps beyond simply filing a motion to dismiss, it is only fair that he be awarded fees under \u00a7 13-17-201. Furthermore, the Plaintiffs are responsible for Cox's attorney fees, regardless of whether other claims may still be pending against other Defendants. As seen in Smith v. Town of Snowmass Village (919 P.2d 868, 873, Colo.App.1996), this is a reasonable conclusion. Therefore, I find that, pursuant to Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 ...,", "When interpreting the Minnesota Human Rights Act (MHRA), it's helpful to look at how federal courts have handled similar cases under Title VII. For example, in the case of Continental Can Co. v. State, the Minnesota court found that principles from Title VII cases can be useful in understanding the MHRA.\n\nThe idea behind Title VII is that employees have the right to work in an environment that's free from discrimination, intimidation, and harassment. This includes sexual harassment, which can be a serious problem.\n\nIn fact, many courts have ruled that employees can take action against their employer if they're sexually harassed by someone who isn't a coworker. This has been upheld by several federal appeals courts, district courts, and even a state court. For instance, in the case of Folkerson v. Circus Circus Enters., the court held that an employee can sue their employer if they're harassed by a non-employee.", "The plaintiff has failed to adequately allege a conspiracy, providing no evidence or facts to support the claim. The plaintiff cannot simply make a conclusory allegation of a conspiracy, but must show agreement and concerted action among specific parties. As the plaintiff has not done so, the \u00a7 1985(3) claim fails as a matter of law.", "Notwithstanding its shortcomings, the holding fails to adequately address Reyes's initial complaint and neglects to consider the historical context of Rule 13.1(a) in relation to his second complaint. Nevertheless, I concur with the court's judgment, as Reyes's second issue can be resolved without compromising the mandatory nature of the court reporter's duty. When a trial court renders a judgment for the recovery of real property, the security amount must be at least equivalent to the value of the property interest's rent or revenue, as stipulated in Tex.R.App. P. 24.2(a)(2)(A). In the absence of an evidentiary hearing on Reyes's motion to set supersedeas, a reporter's record of the hearing was not required, as supported by Michiana Easy Livin' Country, Inc. v.

The current appeal is only too late if the 1993 court decision, which told a company to fix its unconstitutional policy, was a final and complete ruling that could be taken to a higher court. We think the 1993 court order wasn't a complete ruling, similar to a past case where a school district was told to fix a racist atmosphere and that order wasn't considered final. Therefore, the 1995 judgment is...", "The boundaries of a search must be clearly defined, much like the specific parameters outlined in a warrant. If the government fails to adhere to these limitations, the search is deemed unlawful and invalid. When justifying a search based on an individual's consent, the government bears the responsibility of proving that the search was conducted within the scope of the consent given. Even if an individual provides a general statement of consent without specifying any limitations, the search is not given free rein. Instead, it is restricted by the bounds of reasonableness, meaning that the search must be limited to what a reasonable police officer would interpret as being within the scope of the consent. This principle is supported by the ruling in United States v. Strickland (902 F.2d 937, 941, 11th Cir. 1990), which emphasizes the importance of reasonable interpretation. Similarly, the decision in State v. Nabarro (55 Haw. 583, 583-87, 525 P.2d 573, 574-75, 1974) reinforces the idea that consent is not a blank check, and searches must be conducted within reasonable limits.", "The court did not find Perkins' testimony to be prejudicial in these circumstances.\n\nDownward Departures\n\nKornegay argues that the district court made an error in denying him a downward departure on two grounds. Both arguments relate to the 14-month state drug conviction sentence he served before being indicted for the drug deal in question. \n\nFirstly, Kornegay claims that the government delayed prosecuting him to protect Chaney, an informant, from being detected. He argues that this delay prevented his federal sentence from running concurrently with his state sentence, and therefore, a departure should be granted to avoid prejudice. This argument is supported by the ruling in United States v. Saldana (109 F.3d 100, 104, 1st Cir. 1997). \n\nHowever, the district court declined to grant the departure.", "As established in In re Russell C., 120 N.H. at 268, and supported by State v.

In the present case, the juvenile sought dismissal at the initial adjudicatory hearing due to the absence of the State's witnesses, which prevented the hearing from proceeding. The State acknowledged its inability to move forward and did not object to the petition's dismissal. Notably, the State did not request a continuance or a 14-day extension under RSA 169-B:14, II, as seen in In re Juvenile 2007-150, 156 N.H. at 802. Instead, the State's only request was...", "Federal law requires federal approval of Indian wills (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 373) and grants BIA probate judges the authority to approve settlement agreements resolving contested Indian probate proceedings (43 C.F.R. \u00a7 30.150). However, this conclusion is inconsistent with controlling precedent. The Supreme Court has explicitly rejected the idea that federal courts have inherent power to enforce settlement agreements simply because they resolve federal proceedings. In Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. (511 U.S. 375, 377-378, 114 S.Ct. 1673, 128 L.Ed.2d 391, 1994), the Court held that enforcement of such agreements requires its own basis for jurisdiction.

For example, in Dwyer v. Smith, we affirmed a directed verdict in a Title VII case despite evidence of a female police officer being subjected to pornographic material and sexually explicit conversations. Similarly, in Harris v. Clyburn, we affirmed summary judgment for the employer where the only allegation of sexual harassment was occasional tickling by a male superior in the hallway.

In this case, the two transport officers' testimony was believable, and the trial court had the right to decide the defendant was competent to stand trial. The defendant didn't show that they were harmed by any mistakes the court might have made. Since the defendant didn't show any harm, any mistakes didn't violate their rights.

As the Second Circuit Court of Appeals aptly put it in Anderson v. Branen, 'unless manifest injustice otherwise would result.' But in this case, no such injustice arises from denying Seadinovski's petition. The regulation is clear: when seeking to reopen proceedings to apply for relief, you must submit the application and supporting documents together. It's a straightforward rule, and failing to follow it is a legitimate reason to deny the motion. The courts have consistently upheld this principle, as seen in Zhen Nan Lin v.

On appeal, the Defendants argue that the Plaintiff should not have been allowed to use the 2014 Report to support the testimony of their expert witness. We agree with the Defendants on this point. It is well established that experts cannot use the opinions of other non-testifying experts to bolster their own opinions, as this improperly allows one expert to convey the opinion of another expert who is not subject to cross-examination.

Kaiser filed motions to sever under Bankruptcy Rules 7012, 7013, 7021, and 7042. But here's the thing: Rules 7012 and 7013 don't actually deal with severing claims or counterclaims. Rule 7012 is all about the format and deadlines for filing answers and responses to cross-claims, as well as designating core and non-core matters. And Rule 7013 isn't much help either. While it does cover counterclaims and cross-claims, it doesn't say anything about severing them.

The lawsuit does not aim to enforce the guarantee, but rather the debtor, as the primary borrower, is suing the lender, the primary obligee. The complaint does not allege that Turchi, as a guarantor, suffered a direct and concrete injury as a result of the bank's actions. This is supported by cases such as Borough of Berwick v.

But what happens when one parent shirks this duty, leaving the other to bear the burden alone? The Maryland State Assembly has taken bold action to ensure that deadbeat parents are held accountable for their obligations. In fact, the State Constitution empowers courts to imprison individuals who refuse to pay child or spousal support, recognizing that the welfare of vulnerable family members is at stake. (Md.

The General Assembly has further strengthened this commitment by establishing clear procedures for enforcing support orders (Md.

It's not fair to lump all agency lawyers together like they're part of a single private law firm.

As seen in Oklahoma Tax Commission (498 U.S. at 510, 111 S.Ct. 905), Congress has always had the power to limit or dispense with tribal immunity. Similarly, in Talton v. Mayes (163 U.S. 376, 384, 16 S.Ct. 986, 41 L.Ed. 196), it was established that Indian tribes are subject to Congress's dominant authority. As a result, lawsuits like this one are prohibited by the doctrine of tribal sovereign immunity, unless the plaintiff can demonstrate either a clear waiver of immunity by the tribe or an explicit congressional override of the doctrine. This is supported by cases such as Oklahoma Tax Commission (498 U.S. at 509, 111 S.Ct. 905) and Kiowa Tribe v. Manufacturing Technologies, Inc. (523 U.S. 751, 754, 118 S.Ct. 1700, 140 L.Ed.2d 981). In this case, there is no evidence that the Poarch Band has waived its immunity or that Congress has explicitly abrogated the doctrine.", "As noted in UC Hastings Mot. at 5-8, courts in their home forums have previously addressed similar arguments. For example, in Brine v. Univ. of Iowa, 90 F.3d 271, 275 (8th Cir. 1996), the Eighth Circuit affirmed the district court's holding that the University of Iowa and its Board of Regents were immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment for plaintiffs' \u00a7 1983 claims.

Specifically, the detention was of limited duration, lasting approximately forty minutes from the initial stop to the discovery of the currency. This duration is not excessive, as seen in United States v. McFarley (991 F.2d 1188, 1194, 4th Cir. 1993). Moreover, the alleged detention in this case was even shorter.", "The court demonstrated an openness to exploring supplementary considerations. As seen in Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103, 110-11, 110 S.Ct. 1691, 109 L.Ed.2d 98 (1990), the Supreme Court grappled with the question of whether Ohio had the authority to prohibit the possession of child pornography. In its ruling, the Court not only acknowledged the harm inflicted on children involved in the production of such content, as established in Ferber, but also recognized the harm that occurs when child pornography is used as a means of luring or coercing children into sexual activities. This decision underscored the importance of safeguarding children who may not be directly depicted in the pornographic material, thereby establishing a legitimate and compelling state interest. This principle is further supported by United States v. Hilton, 167 F.3d 61, 70 (1st Cir.) (<HOLDING>), cert. denied \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 120 S.Ct. 115, \u2014.", "So, the plaintiff is saying that Chase messed up by not paying flood insurance premiums from the escrow account. The plaintiff is also claiming that Chase broke a promise they made specifically to her, not just a general rule that applies to everyone. As the court in Harrison v. Gore (1995) put it, \"damages ex contractu\" happen when someone breaks a specific promise they made, while \"damages ex delicto\" happen when someone breaks a general rule that applies to everyone. Since the plaintiff's claim is about a broken promise, it's a contract issue and has a 10-year time limit. As the court said in Stokes v. Georgia-Pac. Corp. (1990), that means the plaintiff's claim is still valid.", "We now turn to the question of whether the GAO report constitutes a \"public disclosure\" under \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A). Although the report reveals that some contractors involved in the 254 ESPCs granted between 1999 and 2003 engaged in fraudulent activities, it fails to identify specific contractors or locations where fraud may have occurred. Given the large number of ESPCs and the report's lack of specificity, it does not provide sufficient information to enable the government to launch an investigation into Honeywell's activities. Therefore, we conclude that the GAO report does not qualify as a \"public disclosure\" under \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A), as established in United States v. Alcan Elec. and Eng'g, Inc., 197 F.3d 1014, 1019 (9th Cir.1999). Furthermore, neither the AAA reports nor the GAO report meet the criteria for a \"public disclosure\" under this section.", "The impact on the reproductive and parenting practices of heterosexual couples, whether married or unmarried, is negligible. As stated in Perry II (671 F.3d at 1088, 2012 WL 372713, at *21), there is no logical reason to believe that denying same-sex couples the label of \"marriage\" would encourage opposite-sex couples to have children more responsibly. Furthermore, there is no legal distinction made between biological parents and other couples under federal or state law. It has not been demonstrated that DOMA changes any laws related to childbearing, procreation, or family structure. As a result, the argument that promoting responsible parenting is a valid reason for defining marriage in a certain way lacks a legal basis, as established in Eisenstadt v. Baird (405 U.S. 438, 85, 186, 1971).", "\"The target of a notice of violation should not be forced to play a guessing game about what went wrong and when. Once defendants corrected the specific issues identified in the initial notice, plaintiffs were required to provide another notice with sufficient information to address any remaining problems that could be the subject of a federal lawsuit. This notice would need to include details that were not available at the time of the first notice. The Court rejects the argument that this imposes an impossible burden on plaintiffs. The initial notice was sufficient for its purpose, but it did not provide the necessary details to support the claims in Counts II-IV, as established in HOLDING, 1137, 1144 (9th Cir. 2002).\"\n\nI made the following changes to enhance the effectiveness of the passage:\n\n* Simplified sentence structure and wording for easier understanding\n* Added transitional phrases to improve flow and connectivity between sentences\n* Emphasized key points, such as the purpose of the notice and the Court's rejection of the argument\n* Removed unnecessary words and phrases to increase clarity and concision\n* Added a brief summary of the HOLDING citation to provide context and support for the argument.", "Defendants argue that the claims regarding the spectacled eider and Steller's eider should be dismissed with prejudice as moot. However, since a dismissal on mootness grounds is typically without prejudice to future suits, the parties disagree on the terms of the dismissal. Defendants also seek summary judgment on the remaining part of Count VIII, which alleges that the consultations on the proposed leasing program were inadequate due to a failure to consider critical habitat impacts.", "The judge's ruling omitted two crucial points that could have significantly impacted the case. Firstly, it failed to determine whether Henson had alternative housing options, as he had previously claimed to Prue. Secondly, it did not address whether Henson experienced pain and distress due to his inability to access his medication. Additionally, the judge curtailed Henson's attorney's request to argue the damages issue, but Henson has not contested this procedural decision on appeal. \n\nIt is worth noting that Prue's property may have operated as a rooming house, which could imply that Henson was a roomer rather than a tenant. If this were the case, the prohibition on self-help evictions might not have applied. A similar ruling was made in Harkins v. Win Corp. (771 A.2d 1025, 1029, D.C. 2001). However, neither party has raised this point, and therefore, it remains unaddressed.", "The Department of Labor (DOL) has explicitly stated that designating an authorized representative can restrict their authority to specific types of claims. (Id. at B-2, B-3) Moreover, defendants have provided concrete examples of benefit plans that mandate particular procedures for designating authorized representatives. For instance, some plans require participants to identify authorized representatives in writing, while others involve a formal appointment process or the completion of a specific form. (Defs.' Joint Resp., Exs. 49, 51, 58, 59, 65, 111, 115 at 5361) The critical question remains: have these plans complied with these requirements?", "Evidence that is not open to cross-examination by the prosecution is not permissible in court. However, prior statements made by the defendant that are consistent with their current testimony can be admitted, but only to demonstrate that their story has remained consistent, which is relevant when their credibility is being questioned. A defendant may present their own prior consistent statements in specific situations: when the prosecution implies they have a reason to lie, alleges their testimony is a recent fabrication, or tries to discredit them with a prior inconsistent statement. If the defendant chooses not to testify at trial, these exceptions do not apply. (Citations omitted); see also Bennett v. Commonwealth, 236 Va. 448, 468, 374 S.E.2d 303, 316 (1988) (<HOLDING>).

By mandating the demolition of the passenger gates, the WARA deprives Love Terminal Partners of their pre-existing property right to exclude others, including Dallas, from destroying them. This legislative deprivation of their right to exclude, without any compensation, constitutes a taking. As the court has previously held, the physical taking issue hinges on the interpretation of the WARA's requirements, which is a question of law that can be adjudicated on a motion for summary judgment (Billings v. United States, 322 F.3d 1328, 1332 (Fed.Cir.2003); Santa Fe Pac. R.R. Co., 294 F.3d at 1340).

Furthermore, Chief Wood and Lt. Snooks accuse McGreal of filing a complaint with the Judicial Inquiry Board against Judge Sterba without thoroughly investigating the situation. McGreal's letter emphasized the discrepancy between Sean Taylor's actual sentence and the one Lt. Snooks reported to McGreal. McGreal inferred that this difference was a response to his initial inquiries, rather than a simple mistake by Lt. Snooks. Chief Wood and Lt. Snooks argue that McGreal's statements were motivated by personal interests, and therefore are not protected by the First Amendment. As seen in Kokkinis (185 F.3d at 844-45), they submit that...", "In a shocking breach of trust, the defendant allegedly exploited his position for personal gain and sexual satisfaction. He also betrayed confidences shared with Linda and ignored the warning signs of transference and countertransference that are hallmarks of psychotherapy. What's more, each of these allegations is rooted in a deeper claim of deception. The trial judge has allowed the plaintiff to pursue a separate fraud claim, which mirrors the allegations above. In Illinois, fraud is a distinct legal claim. As such, we believe that these fraud allegations are not relevant to a claim of professional negligence, whether it involves a psychotherapist or a cleric. As the court held in Williams v. Chicago Osteopathic Health Systems, we will focus on the count of professional negligence.", "\"The assertion is unequivocally flawed and contradicts the guidelines.\" (United States v. Urias-Escobar, 281 F.3d 165, 167 (5th Cir.2002)). This glaring error is further exposed by the history of \u00a7 3B1.1. In 1993, the Guideline was amended to include Note 2, specifically to resolve a deep-seated circuit split on the very issue at hand: whether managing assets warrants an adjustment. (U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 500). This split was evident in conflicting rulings, such as United States v. Carroll, 893 F.2d 1502 (6th Cir.1990), United States v. Fuller, 897 F.2d 1217 (1st Cir.1990), United States v. Mares-Molina, 913 F.2d 770 (9th Cir.1990), and United States v. Fuentes, 954 F.2d 151 (3d Cir.1992), which all required a degree of control over other participants, whereas United States v. Chambers, 985 F.2d 1263 (4th Cir.1993), held otherwise. 6.

The legal basis for Resco's claim is sound, as the Third Circuit has established that indirect purchasers can acquire antitrust claims from direct purchasers, which does not violate standing requirements.", "We reject the claims that the prosecutions were extreme, outrageous, or indecent. The plaintiffs were aware of the videotape before their trial and have not shown that any delay in its disclosure caused harm. Therefore, their claims under Brady v. Maryland are dismissed. Additionally, since the plaintiffs have not provided evidence of underlying constitutional violations, their claims of municipal liability also fail.

According to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(1), a court can set aside a judgment that resulted from 'mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect' if a motion is filed within one year of the judgment. In this case, the district court acknowledged that the error was due to inadvertence, making Rule 60(b)(1) applicable with its one-year time limit. The district court tried to avoid the strictness of this time limit by interpreting Rule 60(b)(6) more broadly, as suggested in \u00a7 2864 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (1973). However, since Rule 60(b)(1) clearly applied, and the motion for relief was filed more than a year after the judgment, we hold that it is not valid.

Let's take a closer look at the laws that shape them. \n\nIn 1986, we relied on section 45(1) and comment A to make some crucial points. But that's not all! Let's explore some landmark cases that have paved the way.\n\nTake United States R.R. Ret. Bd. v. Fritz (1980), for instance. This game-changing case revealed that railroad retirement benefits aren't set in stone - they can be altered or even eliminated at any time! \n\nFast-forward to 1999, and we have Devlin v. Transportation Communications Int'l Union, which drove home the point that a claim to vested welfare benefits can be contradicted by the plan documents' clear reservation of the right to amend the plan.\n\nThe same year, International Union, United Auto., Aerospace and Agric. Implement Workers of Amer. v. BVR Liquidating Inc. made it crystal clear that the inclusion of a 'reservation of rights' provision means there was no intent for benefits to vest.\n\nAnd let's not forget McGrath v.

Without evidence of this kind of discrimination, Davis cannot bring a lawsuit under Title I. The law only applies when a union denies its members the right to vote or nominate candidates, which is not the case here. The problem is that Davis is trying to use Title I to challenge a union election that has already taken place, which is not allowed. The law does not support this type of lawsuit. Although Davis claims to be relying solely on...", "When it comes to freedom of expression, the government can't just make up rules as it goes along. There need to be clear standards and procedures in place. This is especially important in public spaces where people gather to express themselves. The courts have been very careful when it comes to restricting speech in these areas, and they've set a high bar for justifying any limits.\n\nHowever, the context of the situation can affect how closely the courts scrutinize these restrictions. For example, in non-public spaces like private property, the government has more flexibility to set rules as long as they're reasonable and don't favor one viewpoint over another.\n\nThe courts have established these principles through a series of important cases, including City of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Publishing Co., Freedman v. Maryland, and FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas. These cases have helped shape our understanding of the balance between free speech and government regulation.", "Individuals who wore beards as a matter of religious obligation were treated unequally. (See id. at 360-61.) The Court of Appeals held that this unequal treatment indicates that the police department has made a value judgment, prioritizing secular (i.e., medical) motivations for wearing a beard over religious motivations. (Id. at 366.) This principle is rooted in Establishment Clause jurisprudence, where the Supreme Court has disapproved of unequal treatment of religious activities compared to secular ones. (See Kir-yas Joel Village, 512 U.S. at 704, 114 S.Ct. 2481, and Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306, 314, 72 S.Ct. 679, 96 L.Ed. 954 (1952).) This bar to unequal treatment requires that civil power be exercised in a manner neutral to religion.", "\"The state court did not have the authority to hear the case.\" (Citation: page 72) HSBC also references several federal court cases where the principle of res judicata was applied in similar situations. However, in each of those cases, the state court had dismissed the plaintiff's claim, making them irrelevant to this case. (Examples: Day, 656 F.Supp.2d 331; Kremer, 456 U.S. 461, 102 S.Ct. 1883, 72 L.Ed.2d 262) Since the state courts did not grant the plaintiffs any relief, there is no question about the state court's ability to provide full relief. \n\n2. Jurisdiction over the Subject Matter \n\nHSBC argues that this Court lacks the authority to hear a case that only involves attorney's fees. According to Section 2000e-5(f)(3), federal district courts only have jurisdiction over certain actions (Holding, 1985), as seen in Lewis v. Ames Dept. Stores, Inc., No. 3:97...", "In a surprising turn of events, both the husband and wife acknowledged that their trucking business was devoid of goodwill and lacked any real value as a going concern. Yet, the court still assigned a staggering $10,000 of goodwill to the business at the end of the trial. The trial court's opinion letter, issued in March 2000, not only valued the business but also paved the way for the August 2000 judgment. During this period, the husband remained silent, failing to object to the court's assignment of goodwill. This lack of action has led the wife to argue that the husband waived his right to challenge the decision. We concur with the wife, finding that the husband's inaction means he did not properly preserve his objection to the court's goodwill valuation. As the landmark case of McDougal v. Griffith (1998) dictates, an issue not raised in the trial court cannot be raised on appeal. However, we may still consider this issue under the...", "In accordance with the Supreme Court's ruling in Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 322-23 (1986), the non-moving party cannot rely solely on their pleadings and must instead provide sufficient evidence to establish every essential element of their case through affidavits, depositions, and admissions on file. As stated in Harter v. GAF Corp., 967 F.2d 846, 852 (3d Cir. 1992), the burden is on the non-moving party to make a showing that supports their claims.\n\nIn this case, the court assumes that the plaintiffs' civil rights claims are brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, despite the complaint not explicitly stating so. The claims appear to be based on allegations of false arrest and malicious prosecution, which the court treats as violations of the Fourth Amendment. This is consistent with the holdings in Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 271-74 (1994), and Hilfirty v. Shipman, 91 F.3d 573, 579 (3d Cir. 1996).", "The record also supports the conclusion that her lack of motivation and poor credibility were undermined. As established in Thomas v. Barnhart, 278 F.3d 947, 959 (9th Cir.), the opinion of Dr. Nelson, Smith's treating physician, was given less weight due to several reasons. Specifically, the opinion was conclusory, as noted in Meanel v.

To apply estoppel principles in retrials, a valid and final judgment must have determined an issue of fact in the defendant's favor (United States v.

According to the guidelines, a defendant qualifies as a career offender if they were at least 18 years old when they committed the crime and already had two or more felony convictions for crimes of violence or controlled substance offenses (U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1).\n\nIn Romero's case, he's 36 years old, and his previous felony convictions for threatening to murder a magistrate judge and threatening to harm a corrections supervisor definitely count as crimes of violence (see United States v. Ladwig, 432 F.3d 1001, 1005 (9th Cir.2005)). The guidelines define crimes of violence to include these types of threats (U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)).\n\nTo be honest, we can't think of any reasonable argument against the court's ruling, and neither can Romero's counsel. It seems pretty clear-cut that Romero meets the criteria for a career offender.", "The clergy are better equipped than civil courts to resolve and interpret ecclesiastical law and religious faith. In a landmark decision, the Watson Court recognized that the local Presbyterian congregation was part of a hierarchical church structure and therefore deferred to the policies of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America. This ruling set a precedent, with the United States Supreme Court subsequently establishing clear limits on judicial intervention in religious congregation disputes. For instance, in Bouldin v. Alexander (1872), the Court ruled that a minority's expulsion of the majority in a congregational church is invalid. Similarly, in Gonzalez v. Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila (1929), the Court reaffirmed the importance of respecting religious institutions' autonomy. This principle was further upheld in Presbyterian Church in the United States v.

All they need to show is that the defendant was aware they had dynamite or a similar chemical compound, mixture, or device designed to detonate. But Mr. Markey is trying to wiggle out of this one, claiming he genuinely believed the dynamite was a dud. Sorry, Mr. Markey, but that's just a classic case of ignorance of the law - \"I thought the rules were different.\" As we've seen before in United States v. Capps, this type of argument doesn't hold water. In fact, it's \"easily rejected,\" as ruled in United States v. Reed. So, let's take a closer look at the evidence surrounding Mr. Markey's...", "In 1935, the court ruled in Kelley v. 598 that a graduated-rate income tax violated the Uniformity Clause. The tax had different rates for income brackets ($5,000, $10,000, and $25,000). The court held that this was non-uniform because it taxed individuals solely based on their higher income. This ruling was later cited in Saulsbury v. Bethlehem Steel Co.

The holdings in these cases are unsurprising, given the absence of state officials responsible for enforcing those laws. However, in the present case, certain state officials are explicitly tasked with enforcing the law in question.

United States, the Federal Circuit clarified the role of the Contract Disputes Act (CDA) in resolving disputes. According to the court, the CDA merely designates the person responsible for making a final decision, and once a claim is made, the parties must relinquish control and allow the contracting officer to make a binding decision. This principle was established in 1991 and has since been refined, with partial overruling in Reflectone, Inc. (60 F.3d at 1579).\n\nWith this guidance in mind, the court must determine whether Kemron properly submitted a \"claim\" to the contracting officer, thereby meeting the necessary jurisdictional requirements to pursue a CDA claim for non-monetary relief. This inquiry is crucial, as seen in cases like Record Steel & Constr., Inc. v. United States (62 Fed.Cl. 508, 520) and Todd Constr., L.P.

AIGA argued that the entire amount, including post-judgment interest, should be allowed and assigned priority level (b).

The primary purpose of the doctrine of official immunity is to shield public officers from civil liability for actions that would otherwise be considered actionable. Ministerial acts, on the other hand, are those where the law clearly defines and prescribes the duties to be performed with precision and certainty, leaving no room for discretion. (See App.\u2014Dallas 1992, writ dism'd w.o.j.) In such cases, officers are not entitled to immunity because their actions do not involve matters within their discretion. (Vasquez v.

Although no explicit assertion is made that Mooney neglected his responsibilities in assisting clients with their investments, the specific wording used clearly implies as much. The phrase \"only knew\" unequivocally suggests that Mooney's knowledge was limited to that particular area. This implication is further reinforced by the subsequent statement, \"didn't know anything about investments.\" Moreover, the phrase \"hated helping clients\" unambiguously conveys Mooney's lack of enthusiasm for fulfilling his duties to his clients. These statements collectively convey a pejorative implication that a reasonable listener would perceive as an assertion that the plaintiff failed to discharge his duties as an advisor. As established in Mehta v. Ohio Univ., 958 N.E.2d 598, 609 (Ohio Ct.App.2011), and reiterated in Scott, 496 N.E.2d at 707, such language constitutes a clear holding.

By adopting a stringent standard that only sanctions overtly abusive behavior, we can minimize the risk of councils mistakenly punishing well-intentioned but inexperienced lawyers. Moreover, even judges themselves can sometimes act unfairly or vindictively towards their colleagues. A rigorous standard can help reduce, if not eliminate, the possibility of judicial discipline being misused to target unpopular judges who are simply doing their job. Furthermore, excessive judicial discipline can have a chilling effect on the proper exercise of judicial discretion, as seen in cases like Pierson v. Ray (1967) and Williams v. United States. By striking a balance between accountability and fairness, we can ensure that our justice system remains impartial and effective.", "When it comes to the law, some decisions are set in stone.

Brooks (1994), where the North Carolina Supreme Court emphasized the importance of evidence-based decisions.\n\nOn the other hand, when it comes to interpreting the law, appellate courts have more flexibility. They can review a trial court's conclusions of law from scratch, as seen in State v. Kincaid (2001).\n\nSo, what happened in this case? On July 6, 2004, Officer Henderson, a seasoned veteran of the Burlington Police Department with 27 years of experience, responded to a call about suspicious activity at Coy's Exxon, a notorious hotspot for shoplifting, fights, and gang activity. The location had a history of trouble, with numerous calls to the police and instances of graffiti.\n\nAs the State argues, '[i]t is clear from the...' - but what does this mean for the case at hand?", "When it comes to homestead exemption, it's not just about meeting the technical requirements. A debtor's intentions and actions play a crucial role in determining whether their property qualifies for protection. For instance, if a debtor moves to a different state and attempts to sell their property, it can be seen as an abandonment of their homestead, as seen in In re Goode (1992). Similarly, if a debtor puts their property on the market for sale or lease, it can be inferred that they no longer intend to use it as their permanent residence, as held in Teasdale v. Frederick (In re Frederick) (1995). However, there are cases where the court has taken a more nuanced approach, considering the debtor's circumstances and intentions in determining whether the homestead exemption applies, such as in In re Herr (1996) and In re Crump (1980). Ultimately, it's essential to look beyond the surface level and examine the debtor's actions and intentions to ensure that the homestead exemption is applied fairly and justly.", "The appellants made their case in the lower court, citing a string of precedents that foreclosed their claims. They pointed to Harper, where the court slammed the door shut on Fair Debt Collection Practices Act allegations. They referenced Figueroa v. Merscorp, Inc., where a RICO claim was dismissed under the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, a judicial firewall that prevents federal courts from meddling in state court matters. They also invoked Distant v. Bayview Loan Servicing, LLC, where the court bluntly stated that the plaintiff's conspiracy claims were, in reality, a thinly veiled attempt to overturn a state court foreclosure judgment - a move that exceeded the court's jurisdiction. The appellants further relied on Simpson v. Putnam Cnty. Nat'l Bank of Carmel, where the court issued a decisive holding, and Smith v. Wayne Weinberger, P.C., where the court's ruling was crystal clear.", "Did you know that under the TVPA, those in higher authority can be held accountable for human rights abuses, even if they didn't directly commit the acts themselves? This means that anyone who authorized, tolerated, or knowingly ignored torture, summary execution, or disappearances can be liable for those actions. (See S.Rep. No. 102-249, at 9.)\n\nThis is important because it opens up possibilities for victims to seek justice under domestic law, even if the defendant didn't personally commit the underlying act. So, how do we determine if someone is liable for aiding and abetting these abuses? We look to federal common law for guidance.\n\nIn our circuit, the standards for aiding and abetting liability are based on our previous opinion in Cabello (402 F.3d 1148). As we explained in Romero (552 F.3d at 1315-16), this means that...", "The dissent's argument that there was no one else present to whom the purse with unknown contents could be given overlooks the presence of Officer Stewart's partner, Officer Lilly. This omission is significant because it ignores a potential alternative to the immediate search of the purse. In reality, there is no evidence to support Officer Stewart's decision to search the purse without first assessing the situation. The dissent's hypothetical scenario, which suggests that returning the purse to the appellant without searching it could have led to dangerous consequences, is purely speculative. In contrast, the officers might have determined that there was no danger in returning the purse because the situation was not as urgent as the 9-1-1 report suggested. As established in State v. Gissendaner (177 Ariz. 81, 83, 865 P.2d 125, 127 (App.1993)), the officers might have had time to evaluate the situation and make a more informed decision.", "The court ruled that a conviction under \u00a7 2252A cannot be combined with a conviction for a similar offense based on the same actions, as this would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause, which prohibits multiple punishments for the same crime. However, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals found in the case of Bobb that a defendant's convictions for both receiving and possessing child pornography did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause because the two offenses occurred on different dates and were prohibited by different laws. This ruling is consistent with other court decisions, such as United States v. Overton, in which the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that convictions for receipt and possession of child pornography did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause because they were based on separate actions. Similarly, in United States v. Polouizzi, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals held that convictions for receipt and possession of child pornography did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.", "Burglary is often proven by looking at the actions of the accused person. To commit burglary, someone must intentionally enter or stay on someone else's property without permission, with the intention of committing a crime against a person or their property. This means that specifying the exact crime they intended to commit is not necessary to charge them with burglary. However, to properly charge someone with burglary, the State must clearly state the essential elements of the underlying crime they intended to commit. Simply naming the crime or referencing the law is not enough. As stated in the Elliott case, the State must provide more details to sufficiently charge the offense.", "Meet the Court Commissioners: The Guardians of Justice\n\nIn the realm of Utah's courts of record, court commissioners wield significant judicial authority, bestowed upon them by the rules of the Judicial Council and the law. With the defendant's informed consent, these quasi-judicial officers can preside over misdemeanor trials, both with and without a jury, ensuring justice is served.\n\nUpon conviction, the commissioner has the power to impose sentence and enter a final judgment, which becomes the court's final word on the matter - a decision that stands firm, even in the face of appeal.\n\nBut what gives court commissioners this authority? The answer lies in the Utah Constitution, Article VIII, Section 1, which vests the state's judicial power in the courts. This provision is mirrored in the United States Constitution, Article III, Section 1, but with a key difference that sets Utah apart.\n\nAs the Utah Supreme Court ruled in In re Bridwell (25 Utah 2d 1, 2, 474 P.2d), court commissioners play a vital role in upholding justice in the Beehive State. Their judgments are not just final, but a testament to the integrity of Utah's judicial system.", "The court abused its discretion by modifying the timesharing agreement without sufficient evidence that it would benefit the minor child to return to their former school in Lake County and change the timesharing arrangement to make the father the primary caregiver. This decision contradicts Florida law, which requires the best interests of the child to be considered in such modifications (\u00a7 61.13(3), Fla. Stat. (2014)). Previous cases, such as Holland v. Holland (140 So.3d 1155, Fla. 1st DCA 2014) and Dobbins v. Dobbins (584 So.2d 1113, 1116, Fla. 1st DCA 1991), support this requirement. Therefore, we reverse the decision and remand the case for a new hearing. During the remand, the court must gather evidence and apply the best interests of the child standard to determine whether modifying the timesharing agreement is in the child's best interests, given the parties' disagreement on which school the child should attend (Watt v. Watt, 966 So.2d 455, Fla. 4th DCA 2007). Once this determination is made, the trial court can proceed accordingly.", "Only when it is shown that the confidence reposed by one person was actually accepted by the other, and merely reposing confidence in another may not, of itself, create the relationship.\n\nAlthough the courts of Kansas have suggested that a somewhat more protective approach may be used when one party is under a disability or disadvantage, as seen in:\n\n* Cor-nett v. Roth, 233 Kan. 936, 941, 666 P.2d 1182, 1186 (1983)\n* Wedman v. Home Nat.

Honeywell Bull, Inc., 730 F.Supp. 1041, 1054 (D.Kan.1990) (<HOLDING>)\n\nThe Supreme Court of Kansas has cautioned...", "Crowder's Fourth Amendment rights are not applicable in this case. As the district court concluded, Crowder relinquished his reasonable expectation of privacy in the Mustang when he handed it over to the shipper. Specifically, he left the doors unlocked, provided the keys to the car carrier driver, and was aware that the driver would enter and drive the vehicle. Under these circumstances, it is unreasonable to expect privacy in the vehicle's contents. Although Crowder did not explicitly authorize the driver to search the vehicle, the driver's actions were implicitly authorized, as they were acting in direct contravention to Crowder's privacy interest (United States v. Young, 350 F.3d 1302, 1308 (11th Cir.2003)).", "Pumping and body cavity search cases typically involve prison inmates and border searches, where the suspect's privacy expectation is lower and the government's interest is greater.", "So, here's the deal. We've got the authority to make this call under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. When it comes to dismissing a case under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), we take a fresh look. As we said in In re Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (754 F.3d 772, 780, 9th Cir. 2014), we're affirming the lower court's decision. They were right to toss out Winter's wrongful foreclosure claim because Winter didn't provide enough evidence to show they weren't in default. Under Nevada law, you've got to prove you didn't default to make a wrongful foreclosure claim stick (see In re Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., 754 F.3d at 785). Plus, Winter's argument that MERS' involvement made the assignment of the deed of trust and note invalid just doesn't fly under Nevada law. We've already seen this play out in Edelstein v. Bank of N.Y. Mellon (286 P.3d 249, 259-60, Nev. 2012). The lower court made the right call in dismissing the case.", "To demonstrate their intent to file Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, plaintiffs can present concrete plans. One way to do this is by showing that they have pending claims that are likely to be affected by the alleged policy or practice being challenged. As stated in Dem v. U.S. Dep't of State, 833 F. Supp. 2d 233, 262 (D.D.C. 2012), \"Recent cases have clarified that... where a FOIA requester challenges an alleged ongoing policy or practice and can demonstrate that it has pending claims that are likely to implicate that policy or practice, future injury is satisfied.\"\n\nIn contrast, in Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Judge Lamberth ruled that no case or controversy existed because CREW did not allege that it had a pending FOIA request with the agency. (527 F. Supp. 2d 101, 106 (D.D.C. 2007)). Similarly, in Coleman, the court held that a plaintiff must have a separate FOIA request pending to demonstrate standing. (134 F. Supp. 3d at 306-08, 2015 WL 5730707, at *8-9).", "To determine if Lipscomb's offense of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon qualifies as a \"crime of violence\" under \u00a7 4B1.2, we must consider whether it \"otherwise involves conduct presenting a serious risk of injury to another\" under the residual clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). This is because the offense does not involve physical force and is not an enumerated offense. We will apply the categorical approach to make this determination.", "According to the Guidelines range, the Supreme Court has made it clear that a sentencing court must provide a thorough explanation for imposing a sentence that deviates from the Guidelines (Gall, 128 S.Ct. at 597). In fact, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c) explicitly requires the court to state its reasons for doing so.\n\nMr. Johnson is now arguing that his 8-year sentence is procedurally unreasonable, citing three key reasons: first, the probation officer's extrapolation was flawed and should have been disregarded; second, he never received notice of the probation officer's extrapolation memorandum; and third, the district judge failed to provide a sufficient explanation for the sentence.\n\nHowever, a crucial fact remains: Mr. Johnson never raised these concerns in the district court. As a result, we are forced to review these arguments under the more stringent plain error standard. This is in line with precedent set by United States v. Romero (491 F.3d 1173, 1176-77, 10th Cir.2007) and United States v. Atencio (476 F.3d 1099).", "Bartholdi's claims of privilege are procedurally barred because they were not properly raised before the Commission. As Section 405 of the Communications Act explicitly states, the Commission must have an \"opportunity to pass\" on an issue before it can be subject to judicial review. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(a)(2). In this case, Bartholdi failed to raise its privilege claims before the Commission, instead only mentioning them before the WTB. Moreover, its application for review to the Commission did not mention either the attorney-client or work-product privilege. The plain language of Section 405 is clear: an issue cannot be preserved for judicial review simply by raising it before a Bureau of the FCC. Rather, it is \"the Commission\" itself that must be afforded the opportunity to pass on the issue. This is consistent with established precedent, as seen in Parsippany Hotel Management Co. v. NLRB, 99 F.3d 413, 418 (D.C.Cir.1996). Despite this, Bartholdi argues that it preserved the...", "In a previous court case (247 Fed.Appx. 730, 734), the defendant, Ray, asked for information about a confidential informant (CI) who helped the police get a search warrant. Ray said he needed this information to defend himself, but he didn't explain how it would help him. (See page 164 of the court document \"Mot. for Discovery, R. 40\".) Even on appeal, Ray didn't show how having this information would have made a difference at his trial. He just said that the CI could have testified about a drug deal, but Ray wasn't even charged with that crime. The only thing we know about the CI is that they gave information to the police that led to a successful search. This is similar to another case (Beals, 698 F.3d 248, 270) where the defendant wasn't...", "When determining whether to combine multiple units into one, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) considers a range of key factors - many of which are identical to those used in initial representation cases. These crucial considerations include the integration of operations, centralized control of management and labor relations, geographic proximity, similarity of employment terms and conditions, similarity of skills and functions, physical contact among employees, collective bargaining history, degree of separate daily supervision, and degree of employee interchange. (Frontier Tel., 344 N.L.R.B. at 1271)\n\nBut what are the most critical factors in making an accretion finding? According to the NLRB, it's employee interchange and common day-to-day supervision that take center stage. In fact, these two factors have been deemed \"critical\" to an accretion finding. (E.I. Du Pont, 341 N.L.R.B. at 608; Super Valu Stores, Inc., 283 N.L.R.B. 134, 136 (1987))\n\nDespite these guidelines, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) ultimately rejected Dean's accretion argument.", "The decision to discharge Bodenstab was justified due to the risks associated with returning him to his previous position as a Doctor of Anesthesiology at Stroger Hospital, given the PRC Staff's recommendations and observations. This decision undermines Bodenstab's claim of pretext. Bodenstab also argues that he presented sufficient evidence of pretext and circumstantial evidence of discrimination by highlighting Cook County's failure to follow its internal policies and inconsistencies in witness testimony. However, he only raised these arguments in his reply brief, thereby waiving them. Even if he hadn't, the evidence he presented is insufficient to support his claims.", "The court also considered the possibility that the defendant had simply left their license at home. But it's hard to imagine someone would risk a mandatory prison sentence by withholding a valid license. As the court put it, 'it's nearly impossible to believe' someone would play 'such an absurd game' that doesn't contribute to finding the truth. In the end, the court stuck with its traditional rule, finding no unfairness in it. Given that the firearms offense in question is still a general prohibition crime in the Commonwealth, it's no surprise that the SJC followed the same due process analysis in Powell's appeal as it did in Jones. This approach is consistent with previous holdings, such as in Morrison. And between the time of Jones and...", "If the court rules in favor of the State on the voluntariness of the defendant's confession, the jury will be instructed to determine its truthfulness without knowing the court's decision. If the jury finds the confession untrue, they must disregard it when deciding the defendant's guilt or innocence. This principle is supported by State v. Thomas (1978) and State v. Bowman (1979), which reaffirm that the trial court is the sole arbiter of voluntariness. The New Jersey Rules of Evidence have codified this principle.", "To address the petitioner's appeal, we should first reject their arguments on the merits. In my opinion, the district court correctly applied AEDPA and relevant caselaw. AEDPA aims to promote comity, finality, and federalism, as intended by Congress (Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 420, 436). To achieve this, Congress established a one-year limitations period to expedite habeas review and finalize state court convictions (Duncan v. Walker, 533 U.S. 167; H.R. Cong. Rep. No. 104-518, at 111).", "To ensure that the Florida Supreme Court reviews death sentences in a rational and consistent manner, as required by Proffitt (428 U.S. at 259, 96 S.Ct. at 2969), defendants and their counsel must have access to all relevant information considered by the court. This is crucial because it involves not only the defendant's right to counsel, as established in Anders v. California (386 U.S. 738, 742, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 1399, 18 L.Ed.2d 493, 1967), but also the right of confrontation, as outlined in Pointer v.

American General Finance, Inc. (Emery I), where the plaintiff provided detailed allegations of fraud committed against herself, but failed to provide specific information about similar fraudulent activities involving other customers of American General Finance. The plaintiff's claims lacked essential details, such as names, dates, and transaction specifics, which are crucial in identifying a violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). RICO requires evidence of multiple instances of fraud, but in this case, only one instance of fraud was alleged against the plaintiff herself. This lack of specificity was also seen in other cases, including Jepson, Inc. v. Makita Corp. and Uni*Quality, Inc. v. Infotronx, Inc., where the courts emphasized the need for more concrete evidence to support claims of fraud.", "The State can't use a trick to introduce evidence of Robertson's past threat to his ex-wife, which was already ruled inadmissible. Now, we need to decide if allowing this evidence was a serious mistake. Our court has said that letting in irrelevant evidence about past crimes can be very harmful because it might make the jury think the defendant is guilty of the current crime just because they have a bad character. In this case, the evidence is very disturbing and could have unfairly influenced the jury.", "The plaintiff consulted with at least seven medical professionals, yet none of them provided a written statement indicating that her impairments necessitated a territorial transfer. As noted in Section I, Finding 37, below, despite characterizing this transfer as a \"reasonable accommodation,\" the plaintiff fails to explain how this change would have enabled her to perform her job's essential functions or provide any supporting medical evidence. In essence, the plaintiff's reasonable accommodation claim relies solely on her own unsubstantiated testimony, which is insufficient, as established in McPhaul v.

As we've seen in cases like Coastal Group, Inc., 274 N.J.Super. at 174, 643 A.2d 649, that's just not the case. So, we're confident in our decision: the gel coat at issue is, in fact, merchandise!", "Rather than trying to escape punishment, a defendant who attempts suicide may be motivated by reasons unrelated to the alleged crime. They may choose to inflict a more severe punishment on themselves than they would face if convicted. This is illustrated in State v. Coudette (1897), where the court rejected evidence of attempted suicide as corroboration of accomplice testimony, as it was likely that the Sioux Indian defendant would commit suicide to avoid confinement regardless of guilt. Similarly, in People v. Carter (1957), the court found error in excluding testimony that offered an alternative explanation for the defendant's attempted suicide. Additionally, in Meggison v.

After the court ruled that the cocaine evidence was inadmissible, the defense argued that the remaining two charges should be dismissed because the State could no longer prove that the officer was acting lawfully. The court's refusal to dismiss these charges is the basis of this appeal. The key question is whether the officer was lawfully performing their duties, as required by \u00a7\u00a7 843.01 and 784.07(2). This issue is similar to the one addressed in Pan v.

Unfortunately, the study remains silent on this critical detail. \n\nWithout knowing whether the sample was drawn from a properly defined universe or if it's truly representative of that universe, the study's findings are rendered useless in proving irreparable injury.

In this case, the record shows that the speech of the plaintiffs, although it touched on issues of child safety and DeKalb DFCS mismanagement, was not intended to address matters of public concern from the perspective of a citizen.\n\nAs stated in White Plains Towing Corp. v.

In this case, we concur with the Commonwealth that the petitioner had a fair shot at making her case for ineffective assistance, despite the limitations imposed by the Post-Conviction Relief Act (PCRA). The timeline is telling: sentenced on January 14, 2008, she opted not to raise her claims on direct appeal, as allowed by Bomar. Instead, she filed a PCRA petition on January 12, 2009, and eventually secured relief just eleven days shy of completing her two-year probationary sentence. Notably, PCRA relief was within reach throughout her two-year sentence. As Ahlborn (699 A.2d at 720) makes clear, the opportunity for relief was there. Yet, the petitioner failed to request expedited...", "According to case law, individuals can be held liable for discriminatory behavior they are aware of but fail to address. For instance, in Gallo v. Wonderly Co., Inc. (2014), the court ruled that a person can be liable under \u00a7 296 for not taking action to remedy discriminatory behavior. Similarly, in Lewis v. Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (1999), the court established that a supervisor's failure to take adequate remedial measures can be considered \"actual participation\" under HRL \u00a7 296(6). This is supported by Cid v. ASA Institute of Business & Computer Technology, Inc. (2013), which found that failing to investigate discrimination complaints can lead to aiding and abetting liability under the New York City Human Rights Law. In contrast, Morgan v. NYS Atty.

To make this happen, the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) can designate the state prison as the place where Ragnoli will serve his federal sentence, retroactively. This would mean Ragnoli would spend less time in custody overall, as ordered by the State Court.\n\nThe BOP usually likes to get input from the federal sentencing court before making a decision like this. If they don't hear back within 60 days, they'll make the decision on their own. If the court does respond within 60 days, the BOP will follow their guidance. This is in line with a previous ruling from 1997.

The subsequent motion for reconsideration, plaintiffs' response, and defendant's reply collectively provide a comprehensive briefing of this issue. As succinctly stated by Judge Blackburn in Young v. Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (2013), equitable tolling is only applicable when a plaintiff demonstrates diligent pursuit of their claims and extraordinary circumstances beyond their control that prevented timely filing. This principle is further supported by the Tenth Circuit's holding in Marsh v. Soares (2000). In the present case, a district court order has been issued, and we must now consider whether the circumstances warrant equitable tolling of the statute of limitations.", "Given the pending criminal investigation, we believe it is appropriate to remand this case to the trial court. This will allow the City to review the field interview cards and submit those that are allegedly involved in the ongoing investigation for in-camera review by the trial court. The City claims these cards are exempt from disclosure. Meanwhile, petitioners will be granted immediate access to all field interview cards that are not submitted for in-camera review. The trial court will then determine which cards or portions of cards are exempt from disclosure. Importantly, an entire card should not be deemed exempt simply because it contains some exempt information. Instead, the exempt information should be redacted, as held in Eldridge (86 S.W.3d at 574). The trial court has the discretion to prescribe the necessary procedures.", "In a surprising turn of events, Nusspickel's sentence was called into question due to two key concerns. Firstly, despite the jury's conviction on the lesser charge of simple battery, the court found her guilty of the more severe aggravated battery charges. Secondly, allegations of misconduct surfaced, suggesting she had inappropriate contact with one of the victims after the incidents in question. Nusspickel argues that the State failed to demonstrate that the judge did not consider these impermissible factors when determining her sentence. However, according to established precedent, the trial court's sentencing decisions within the legislatively-set limits are generally considered discretionary and not subject to appellate review.

This case differs from Stewart and Cole because Hilton made a contemporaneous objection when the evidence was introduced. Although there are no identical cases, a review of Stewart, Cole, and other cases leads us to conclude that Hilton's argument is preserved for our review. As stated in Vaughn v. State, 338 Ark. 220, 992 S.W.2d 785 (1999), a defendant must renew their objection and obtain a ruling when the evidence is introduced at trial to preserve the issue for appeal. Similarly, in Holt v.

On review, we examine the denial of the motion to [insert remainder of sentence].", "The court cited two cases in support of its decision: 2010 WL 877569, at *3, and Hart, 1999 WL 225956, at *2. The court reasoned that since Samshi Homes acknowledged the documents filed by De Leon were in the form of mechanics liens, they were instruments \"provided by the laws of this state\" and therefore not presumed to be fraudulent under section 51.901(c)(2)(A) (Id.). The court concluded that Samshi Homes' complaints based on section 53.054 were beyond the scope of the current proceedings (Id. at 668). Furthermore, the court held that Samshi Homes' substantive evidentiary claims - that it, rather than Kama, owned the subject properties and that Kama never entered into an agreement with De Leon - were also beyond the scope of the section 51.903 proceedings (Id., citing Becker, 2010 WL 877569, at *3). Although factually distinct from the...", "In the past, courts have reviewed claims of ineffective trial counsel in direct appeals when there was a sufficient trial court record. However, the court rejected Mr. Wheat's argument, stating that the new rule provides the only procedure for seeking relief in the sentencing court for ineffective counsel, and failing to file a motion constitutes a complete waiver of this right. The rule's language remains unchanged, providing the exclusive means to raise ineffective assistance of counsel claims. This has been confirmed in subsequent cases, such as Brown and State v. Celis-Garcia.", "Under the Fourteenth Amendment, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants' actions violate their due process rights. Specifically, they claim that Defendants have deprived them of procedural due process in several ways. \n\nFirstly, Plaintiffs argue that they are forced to participate in the five-phase treatment program at Atascadero without their consent. Secondly, they allege that Defendants administer medication to them in non-emergency situations without their permission. Finally, they claim that Defendants subject them to privilege reductions, access level reductions, and re-classifications without providing adequate notice or opportunity to respond to accusations of alleged sanctionable conduct.\n\nAs the court held in The Fourte (9th Cir.1994), such deprivations may constitute a violation of Plaintiffs' liberty interest. Therefore, we will consider these allegations in more detail below.", "The crux of the matter lies in identifying the issue at hand and determining whether one party presented it, only to be disputed by another. As the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled in Gies v. Nissen Corp. (1973), an issue is considered 'joined' when one party formally requests relief from the other through a pleading. This means that when a party serves a cross-claim, they're essentially throwing down the gauntlet, challenging the other party to respond. The court views this as a clear indication that the parties are locked in a dispute, with each side seeking relief from the other. This formal process ensures that both parties are on notice and can later enforce any relief granted. As seen in Goldblatt, this requirement is crucial. In the case at hand, however, the Streitzes and Marshall failed to follow this formal process, leaving the issue unresolved.", "There is no coverage for diminished value claims, as supported by the following court cases:\n\n* Siegle v. Progressive Consumers Ins. Co. (2001): The court ruled that the policy does not obligate the insurer to pay for diminished market value, as the insurer's liability is limited to the actual cash value or the cost of repair or replacement.\n* Rezevskis v. Aries Ins. Co. (2001): The court held that diminished value is not a covered loss, as it is not a type of damage that can be repaired.\n* O'Brien v. Progressive Northern Ins. Co.: [insert relevant information from this case]\n\nThese cases clearly establish that diminished value claims are not covered under the policy.", "In a series of landmark cases, the Illinois courts have consistently held that defective petitions can be challenged and invalidated, even if they have been approved by a court. For instance, in 1934, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that a petition with deficient signatures could be challenged through a quo warranto proceeding, placing the burden of justification on the defendant (356 Ill. 340, 343-46). This principle has been reaffirmed in subsequent cases, including People ex rel. Curtin v. Heizer (1967), where the court allowed a collateral attack on a county court's proceedings to establish a fire district due to a jurisdictional defect in the petition (36 Ill. 2d 438, 441). Similarly, in People ex rel. Mills v. Fairfield Community High School District No. 225 (1947), the court declared that an attempted judgment in an annexation case was a nullity due to a defective petition, and could be challenged through quo warranto despite the court's initial finding of jurisdiction (397 Ill. 233). This line of reasoning has been upheld in more recent cases, such as City of Wood Dale (244 Ill. App. 3d at 834-36), and People ex rel. Village of Long Grove v. [case citation]. These decisions demonstrate the importance of ensuring that petitions meet the necessary legal requirements, and that defects can have serious consequences for the validity of subsequent proceedings.", "\"In this instance, the uncooperative witness remains free while the appeal is pending.

Johnson (1984), In re Witness Before Special October 1981 Grand Jury (1983), In re Rosahn (1982), and Brown v. United States (1972).

In light of these cumulative facts, a jury would be justified in concluding that the Plaintiff was, in fact, targeted or singled out for the call specifically due to his known ethnicity or national origin. As explicitly stated in the Report, it has been well-established that prisoners are protected under the Equal Protection Clause from invidious discrimination. (Report at 57, citing Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 556, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974)). These protections unequivocally extend to claims based on the denial of specific prison work assignments due to race, as exemplified in LaBounty v. Adler, 933 F.2d 121, 123 (2d Cir.1991). Furthermore, a recent district court decision has relied on this principle, underscoring its continued relevance and applicability.", "In a crucial moment, Ischa the drug dog was deployed to inspect Hill's vehicle after his arrest. Notably, the canine's involvement did not prolong Hill's detention or expand the scope of the search beyond what was already justified. The officers' decision to hold the car pending the inspection was therefore unwaveringly justified. According to Edwards, Ischa's alert on the outside of the car was a pivotal moment. Considering Hill's suspicious behavior, his outstanding warrant for a controlled substance offense, his notorious reputation for drug activity, and the conclusive indication from a highly trained drug dog, we firmly conclude that the district court correctly found probable cause to search the vehicle's interior for illicit contraband. This ruling is squarely in line with established precedent, as seen in United States v. Linkous (285 F.3d 716, 721, 8th Cir. 2002) and United States v.

Additionally, Davis v. State, 859 So.2d 465, 472 (Fla.2003) held that a confession remains voluntary despite law enforcement's characterization of the situation as a \"missing-person case,\" given that the detectives accurately informed the defendant of the missing person's identity and merely failed to disclose their prior knowledge of the victim's death. Furthermore, Nelson v. State, 850 So.2d 514, 521-22 (Fla.2003) established a significant holding in this regard. In summary, a common thread runs through each of these cases, namely...", "We take issue with Sachs's assertion that the sale of UPCM's stock, but not its real property assets, automatically exempts this transaction from UREBA's scope. While stocks and shares are typically considered personal property, there are instances where their transfer is merely incidental to the transfer of real property assets. As demonstrated in J.I. Kislak v. Carol Mgmt. Corp. (1959), a corporation's stock sale can be equivalent to a sale of its assets. Many jurisdictions focus on the substance of such transactions rather than their form. For example, in Cooney v. Ritter (1991) and Shochet Sec., Inc. v. First Union Corp., the courts adopted this approach.", "In the past, the Supreme Court has ruled on cases related to free speech and equal protection under the law. For example, in 1952, the court decided that the government can't restrict people's freedom of speech or treat certain groups unfairly. Similarly, in 1948, the court ruled that people should be treated equally and not discriminated against.\n\nThe government is now arguing that cable companies, not the government, are responsible for deciding what content is inappropriate and should be blocked. However, even if a private company makes this decision, the government can still be held accountable if it encouraged or allowed the company to restrict people's access to certain content.\n\nIn other words, just because a private company is making the decision, it doesn't mean the government is off the hook. If the government played a role in encouraging or allowing the company to restrict access to certain content, it can still be held responsible.

The Commission chose to accept the testimony...", "In a dramatic turn of events, the court took a bold stance on December 7, 2007, dismissing two cases due to the State's failure to prosecute. The reason? The State had neglected to file any charging documents in either case, leaving the court no choice but to take action. The court's orders were clear: the cases were dismissed with prejudice, citing the State's inaction as the reason.\n\nBut this raises an important question: does the court have the authority to dismiss a criminal action when no charging document has been filed? The answer lies in N.D.R.Crim.P. 48(b). As the district court generally has jurisdiction over criminal cases under N.D. Const, art. VI, \u00a7 8, and N.D.C.C. \u00a7 27-05-06(1), this Court has the power to weigh in on this critical issue. And with jurisdiction granted under N.D. Const, art. VI, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 6, and N.D.C.C. \u00a7 29-28-07(1), we can look to precedent-setting cases like City of Jamestown v. Snellman (1998) and State v.

The answer is multifaceted. While they were indeed responsible for disseminating certain weather data, they did not fall short in their duty regarding Critical Weather Advisories (CWAs) or Pilot Reports (PIREPs). Moreover, they had no obligation to share Meteorological Impact Statements (MISs) or the information they contain.\n\n**The Scope of Duty: A Reasonable Standard**\n\nThe key issue at hand is not whether the government had a duty to report weather conditions, but rather the extent of that duty. Air traffic controllers are held to a reasonable standard, expected to act as a prudent controller with similar experience and training would in similar circumstances. This principle is well-established in case law, as seen in Kelley v. United States (2009) and Mussivand (544 N.E.2d at 270). In the context of Flight 2745, we must examine the specifics of the situation to determine the controllers' responsibilities.", "Crucially, under current law, the Debtor will not receive a discharge unless they fulfill their obligations under the Plan, as mandated by 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1141(d)(5). This means that if the Debtor fails to perform, Osh-untola will not be significantly prejudiced by the Plan's confirmation. Notably, the Court does not interpret 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 108 as extending this period. Although Oshuntola did not raise objections on these grounds, the Court has a paramount duty to ensure that any confirmed plan meets the stringent requirements of the Bankruptcy Code, as emphasized in In re Great Northwest Recreation Center, Inc. (74 B.R. 846, 852, Bankr.D.Mont.1987). Furthermore, courts have historically disagreed on whether individual debtors can retain exempt property without violating the \"absolute priority\" rule, as seen in In re Bullard (358 B.R. 541, 544-45, Bankr.D.Conn.2007). Ultimately, the modification concludes with the phrase...", "In a bold move, the Government argues that the urgent need to protect law enforcement and the public from potential threats justified the entry into the apartment building, overriding any expectation of privacy. This claim is rooted in the cumulative evidence of the circumstances. However, the Government's primary stance is that the Defendant has no legitimate claim to privacy in the common areas of the building. This crucial point takes center stage in the Court's Fourth Amendment investigation. The reality is, there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in the shared spaces of a multi-unit apartment building, as established in landmark cases such as United States v. Acosta and United States v. Dickens.", "In the case of Bronster (82 Hawai'i at 40, 919 P.2d at 302), the court defined \"damage\" as a product failing to meet a customer's expectations, or in other words, providing \"insufficient product value.\"\n\nAccording to the economic loss rule, a manufacturer is not responsible for preventing a product from damaging itself, whether it's due to negligence or strict products liability.

This means that if a private party refuses to extend a contract opportunity to someone solely because of their race, it violates their Section 1 rights. This is similar to the ruling in Jones, where a Negro's right to purchase property was violated when a private seller refused to sell to them because of their race. The Court reaffirmed this in 427 U.S. at 170-71, 96 S.Ct. at 2594, and in subsequent cases such as Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc.

Christman presented...", "We respectfully submit a motion for attorneys' fees based on the proposal for settlement filed by Rebeca Ipox in her individual capacity. In wrongful death cases involving joint personal representatives, it is well-established that the joint personal representatives constitute the party plaintiffs. As such, only the joint personal representatives, acting in their official capacity, are authorized to make a valid demand for judgment. Consequently, the demand for judgment at issue in this case is invalid. This position is supported by Florida Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 768.20 and 768.79 (2001), as well as the holding in Reid, 888 So.2d at 103. \n\nAppellees' assertion that Rebeca Ipox's service of the proposal for settlement should be deemed to be the act of both joint personal representatives is unfounded. The proposal for settlement explicitly states that it was made by Rebeca Ipox in her individual capacity (see Holding, 984). Furthermore, there is no evidence to suggest that the joint personal representatives authorized or ratified Rebeca Ipox's actions in this regard.", "The key difference between this case and Button is that employees here must choose between a lawsuit and a conciliation offer, whereas in Button, there was no conciliation offer. However, in both cases, individuals had to decide whether to pursue a lawsuit or not. This similarity means that the solicitation in this case falls within the scope of protected activity established in Button. The characteristics that brought the solicitation in Button under constitutional protection are equally present here. As supported by Great Western Cities, Inc. v. Binstein, 476 F.Supp. 827 (N.D.I11.1979), and the continued vitality of Button, the solicitation in this case is protected.", "According to Wenner, 351 F.3d at 973, a burglary occurs in a dwelling. The categorical approach, as set forth in Taylor, requires the trial court to examine only the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense. This approach is outlined in 495 U.S. at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143. Applying this approach to Rodriguez's California first-degree burglary conviction, it does not constitute generic burglary. This is because California Penal Code Sections 459 and 460 do not require \"unlawful or unprivileged entry\" for a burglary conviction, as noted in Taylor, 495 U.S. at 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143. In fact, some states' burglary statutes, including California's, define burglary more broadly, eliminating the requirement that the entry be unlawful. This is supported by People v. Frye, 18 Cal.4th 894, 954, 77 Cal.Rptr.2d 25, 959 P.2d 183 (Cal. 1998). In cases like this, where the state burglary statute is...", "I disagree with the decision.

Mr. Reimer had done similar tests plenty of times before on boilers that were just as old and worn out, and he never cooled them down first. Nothing he saw or discussed with Mr. Nelson suggested that this particular boiler was any more dangerous than the others. Of course, the other side will probably try to dispute Mr. Reimer's story, but based on what we know so far, it's clear that there's a real question about how much Mr. Reimer knew about the risks involved. It's kind of like those cases where people did something similar before without getting hurt, like in Kraft or Piotrowski, and it turned out to be important in figuring out how much risk they really knew about.", "\"Protecting Individuals from Unjust Administrative Actions\n\nThe law provides safeguards against administrative decisions that overstep their bounds.

Ex. 45). If the Plan had intended to provide these benefits to employees terminated before 55, it would have been unnecessary to rehire laid-off employees after they turned 55 just to make them eligible. Pan Am's decision to accommodate these employees and offer them higher benefits was a generous gesture, not a contractual obligation. In fact, it was a one-time favor that didn't create a precedent for future employees or modify the Plan's terms. As the court ruled in Perreca v. Gluck, 295 F.3d 215, 224-25 (2d Cir.2002), this kind of voluntary action doesn't establish a binding commitment. Therefore, PBGC's interpretation of the Plan's...", "As the court has previously held, an indictment must be sufficient to inform a jury of the charged offense. In United States v. Young, the court cited Boyce Motor Lines, Inc. v. United States, stating that the allegations in the indictment must be enough to notify a jury of the offense. Similarly, in United States v. Sampson and United States v. Barker Steel Co., Inc., the court emphasized that an indictment is sufficient if it includes the essential elements of the offense and fairly informs the defendant of the charges against them. As the court put it in Hamling v. U, an indictment must meet two key requirements: it must contain the elements of the offense and inform the defendant of the charges, and it must enable the defendant to plead an acquittal or conviction to prevent future prosecutions for the same offense. Following this principle, the Teleguz court upheld section 922(k).", "As we draw our conclusion, we're aware that courts in other jurisdictions have rejected the notion that reforms to the juvenile justice system have altered its fundamental character as a guardian of the state's children. For instance, in Valdez v. State (1991), the Arkansas Court of Appeals upheld this principle, as did the California Court of Appeal in In re Myresheia W. (1998) and the Georgia Supreme Court in In re L.C. (2001). Similarly, in State, ex rel. D.J. (2002), a dissenting justice in Louisiana argued that changes to the system warranted a jury trial, while in State v. G (971), the court upheld a statute requiring juvenile trials to be heard by the court, with a concurring justice acknowledging that if the juvenile code became purely punitive, a jury trial might be justified under the state constitution. Additionally, in State v. Hezzie R. (1998), the Wisconsin Supreme Court made a significant holding on this issue.

Dickey-Williams has filed three timely objections, arguing that the Report erred in dismissing the ALJ's failure to apply the treating physician rule to Dr. Clague's opinions, neglected to properly consider psychologist Ross Thayer's opinions, and overlooked the ALJ's failure to discuss how migraines impact her residual function capacity (Objection at 2-7, ECF No. 14).

In fact, the FTC's history shows that it has never had a long-standing policy of allowing companies to make misleading claims based on Cambridge Filter Method test results. Instead, the FTC has tried to educate consumers about the tar and nicotine levels in different cigarette brands and has even stopped some companies from making false claims about these test results. The fact that the FTC didn't force the petitioners to correct their misleading use of \"light\" descriptors doesn't mean they approved of it - not enforcing a federal law isn't the same as giving it the green light.

In the present case, Freberg was never afforded the opportunity to deliver a completed product or service to Dr. Robert Thomason. As a result, up to and including July 25, 1973, the day following Dr. Elizabeth's passing, Freberg's cause of action against the Thomasons had not yet accrued, and thus, the limitations period had not begun to run. In fact, Freberg's limitations did not commence until after he was initially prevented from continuing his tasks. This is consistent with the ruling in Scott v. Walker, supra. To hold that Freberg's cause of action accrued after each day's work would unnecessarily fragment the accrual period for each of these indivisible tasks. This is supported by the precedents set forth in Jones v. Lewis, 11 Tex. 359 (1854), Caldwell v.

As a result, the district court upheld the state post-conviction court's decision, which had denied relief due to Bishop's failure to show prejudice. (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254; Alvarado v. Hill, 252 F.3d 1066, 1068 (9th Cir. 2001))", "We lack jurisdiction to review the district court's orders because they do not meet the requirements for appealability. Specifically, they are not final judgments under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, nor are they among the types of orders listed in \u00a7 1292(a). Additionally, they were not certified as final and appealable by the district court under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) or 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b), and they do not fall within a jurisprudential exception, such as the collateral-order doctrine. See Mosley v. Cozby, 813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir. 1987); Dardar v. Lafourche Realty Co., 849 F.2d 955, 957-59 (5th Cir. 1988); Save the Bay, Inc. v. United States Army, 639 F.2d 1100, 1102-03 & n.3 (5th Cir. 1981); In re Macon Uplands Venture, 624 F.2d 26, 27-28 (5th Cir. 1980); Melancon v. Texaco, Inc., 659 F.2d 551.", "The exception to the statute does not apply in this case, as neither waiver nor resolution occurred in the workers' compensation case. \n\na. Compensability is not at issue, as Vallejos elected his remedy by filing a petition for benefits, receiving payments, and negotiating a settlement. The cases cited by Vallejos, including Vasquez v. Sorrells Grove Care, Inc., Hernandez v. United Contractors Corp., and Lowry v. Logan, are distinguishable because they involved contested workers' compensation claims where the employee's status or the claim's compensability were disputed.", "Spies listened to the recording of Vaughn's interrogation of Harris before ordering his arrest. However, she should have known that Harris's confession was suspect and untrustworthy because it was extracted from a 12-year-old child with no prior law-enforcement experience, outside his mother's presence, and using intensive techniques. The district court erred in concluding that the confession supported probable cause for the arrest. As established in Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89, 91 (1964), the confession should not have been relied upon.", "When it comes to deciding if someone should pay back a victim for the harm they caused, the court has the final say. If someone is found guilty of a crime, the victim can ask for restitution. The court will consider several factors, including how much money the victim lost because of the crime. To get restitution, the victim must show that the loss was directly caused by the defendant's actions. In this case, Willis agrees that P.H. should receive restitution.", "In the case of Sanusi v. Gonzales (2006), the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) has the discretion to deny a motion to remand a case unless the moving party can demonstrate a \"heavy burden\" of evidence that would likely change the outcome of the case if the proceedings were reopened. This means that the BIA will not typically consider granting a motion to remand unless the new evidence presented is substantial and compelling enough to warrant a different result.\n\nIn accordance with this principle, the BIA's decision not to grant discretionary relief in this case was deemed legally sound, and the court lacked the authority to review the BIA's conclusion regarding the \u00a7 212(c) factors. This is consistent with the statute 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) and supported by previous rulings, such as De La Vega v. Gonzales (2006), which held that the court's jurisdiction is limited in reviewing discretionary decisions made by the BIA.", "**COURT OPINION**\n\n**GREENBERG, Circuit Judge**\n\n**I. JURISDICTION**\n\nThomas J. Capano appeals a district court order dated June 27, 1997. The order held that Capano waived his attorney work product privilege regarding certain documents created by him, which were seized by the United States from a third party through a subpoena. The district court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231, and we have jurisdiction to review the district court's order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. (See In re Grand Jury, 111 F.3d 1066, 1073-77 (3d Cir.1997).)\n\n**II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n\nIn July...", "The absence of consent from the vehicle's owner is a crucial factor in this case. Notably, the identity of the owner was never definitively established, as no conclusive link was made between the car driven by the appellant and the vehicle stolen from Ms. Hautala. The government correctly asserts that lack of consent can be demonstrated through circumstantial evidence. In this instance, the cumulative effect of the appellant's flight, Ms. Hautala's testimony, the broken window, and the disparate VINs on the car and registration card provides a compelling body of circumstantial evidence from which the jury could reasonably infer that the vehicle belonged to someone else and that the appellant lacked permission to operate it. As established in Powell v. United States, 135 U.S.App.D.C. 254, 258, 418 F.2d 470, 474 (1969), circumstantial evidence can be sufficient to prove lack of consent.", "The law is clear: no promises can be made to witnesses before they take the stand. As the court emphasized in Shabazz, 336 F.3d at 165, any prior agreements or understandings are null and void. Moreover, a witness's vague hope for leniency is not enough to create a quid pro quo arrangement. The court has spoken: a witness's testimony must be voluntary, not bought or bartered. (Shabazz, 336 F.3d at 163)\n\nIn this case, respondent points out that Deyo's motion under CPL \u00a7 440.10 was denied after a thorough hearing. (R. Mem. at 28, n. 7) Furthermore, Deyo's own affidavit in support of his \u00a7 440.10 motion was not part of the record on appeal in petitioner's direct appeal. (R. Mem. at 32)\n\nAs we delve deeper into the case law, we find that the Supreme Court has weighed in on this issue. In Miller-El, 537 U.S. at 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, the Court established a crucial precedent. The Second Circuit has since followed suit, as seen in Richardson v. Greene, 497 F.3d 212, 217 (2d Cir.2007).", "In accordance with a legally obtained warrant, which was based on information unrelated to the initial warrantless entry, the Court declined to suppress the evidence. This decision was not due to a lack of causal connection between the search and the conduct, but rather because the search was deemed lawful in all respects. The search was carried out pursuant to a warrant that the Court determined to be lawful, and it was conducted in a lawful manner. (See id. at 813-14, 104 S.Ct. 3380.) The attenuation doctrine only applied to the initial 19-hour-old entry. In contrast, the central issue here is that the search that yielded the seized evidence was conducted with excessive force and was therefore unlawful. \n\nFurthermore, United States v. Hector, 474 F.3d 1150 (9th Cir.2007), does not support the majority's holding. (Id. at 1154-55.) Specifically, the holding emphasizes that if law enforcement officers fail to fulfill their obligation to serve warrants in a lawful manner, it may have significant implications for the admissibility of evidence obtained during such searches."]
