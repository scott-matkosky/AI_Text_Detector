Despite being lower in lung cancer cases, leptin's connection to tumour-related factors, including prognosis, remains elusive. The verdict is clear: leptin is not the clinical marker we've been searching for in the fight against lung cancer (Tab. 2, Fig. 2, Ref. 22).", "The gender of the fetus does not influence the likelihood of an emergency department (ED) visit for asthma-related issues during pregnancy. Furthermore, fetal gender is not linked to adverse outcomes in pregnant women who experience asthma-related ED visits.", "Our research suggests that a specific genetic mutation, R14C KCNQ1, isn't enough on its own to cause atrial fibrillation (AF). Instead, we think that a combination of factors is needed. Imagine it like a \"one-two punch\". The genetic mutation is the \"first hit\", which sets the stage for problems with the heart's electrical system. Then, an environmental factor like high blood pressure comes along and acts as the \"second hit\", triggering the development of AF. This combination of factors could also explain why AF becomes more common as we age.", "After controlling for age and race, our study found that circumferences and related ratios exhibit a significant correlation with height in a representative sample of the US population. These findings have important implications for the clinical and epidemiological application of these anthropometric measures and indexes.", "Interestingly, we found that hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) tend to have a significantly longer QTcD interval compared to those without LVH.
