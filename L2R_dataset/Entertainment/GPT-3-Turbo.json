Explore the artistry of I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW, an essential masterpiece that defies convention and ignites the imagination.", "\"I Am Curious: Yellow\" is a laughable and pretentious film that fails to be taken seriously, regardless of one's political views. The claim that frontal male nudity always results in an NC-17 rating is false, as there are R-rated films that feature male nudity, albeit briefly. However, films with explicit female genitalia are nearly nonexistent in mainstream cinema or television, revealing an apparent cultural discomfort with depicting women's bodies authentically.", "To prevent making such a film again, this movie is interesting as an experiment but lacks a clear story. Some may feel good for watching it due to its discussion of important issues, but it doesn't have a clear purpose. The viewer doesn't gain new insights, unless they think of some while their mind wanders during this pointless film. It might be more worthwhile to spend time watching a tree grow outside a window.", "This movie seems to take inspiration from Godard's Masculin, f\u00e9minin and I recommend watching that instead. The film excels in two areas: the authentic acting and the impressive cinematography. However, what stands out the most is the constant display of triviality. Lena Nyman's performance may come across as irritating, portraying stupidity and excessive nudity that may not be appealing. In contrast to Godard's work, this film seems to lack the intellectual depth and opts for a more foolish approach. Such differences could be attributed to the ideals of French and Swedish societies. This movie reflects the time and location in which it was made. Rating: 2/10.", "Upon hearing about this peculiar film for numerous years, I am reminded of the classic Peggy Lee song, \"Is that all there is?\". When this controversial film first emerged in the United States, I was just a young teenager and unable to attend the theater showing, although I did manage to sneak into \"Goodbye Columbus\". Eventually, I had the opportunity to view this film at a local film museum, yet by then, I found myself as old as my parents were when they originally watched it.\n\nThe sole reason this film did not fade into obscurity was due to the obscenity case that it incited upon its U.S. release. Many individuals flocked to witness this film under the false impression that it was a scandalous piece of erotica, only to be met with unappealing visuals of Swedish settings, banal street interviews, absurd political undertones, and lackluster simulated intimate scenes featuring unimpressive actors.\n\nThough some may regard it as a cultural icon, a holy grail, or a historic artifact, the general sentiment leans towards shunning it, incinerating its remnants, and sealing its ashes within a leaden chest. Despite the efforts of elite aesthetes in extracting value from its dreary pseudo-revolutionary political spiel, without the censorship controversy, it would likely have been overlooked and left to fade away.\n\nInstead, the rhythmic title of \"I Am Blank, Blank\" was incessantly echoed as a tantalizing lure for various genres of adult cinema (e.g., \"I am Curious, Lavender\" for LGBTQ films, \"I am Curious, Black\" for blaxploitation films), propelling periodic resurgences for a fresh wave of viewers enticed by the allure of a pioneering \"erotic\" masterpiece that reshaped the industry.\n\nIn conclusion, it is recommended to abstain from this ailing creation. Should one feel compelled to see it, opting to rent the video and promptly fast-forwarding to the salacious segments would deliver a swift resolution to the ordeal.", "I'd place this film right at the top of my list of unwatchable trash! It's the kind of movie that's not just bad, but so unbearable that you're expected to like it because it's supposed to be good for you. The sex scenes, once considered shocking, couldn't even excite a rabbit. The so-called controversial politics feel like something out of a high school sophomore's amateur night in Marxism. The film tries too hard to be arty, but ends up failing miserably. The grainy black and white photography, out-of-focus shots, and bad sound all contribute to a film that some dare to call art?", "The screenplay writer for this movie clearly did not refer to any books on Lucille Ball, particularly her autobiography. There are numerous inaccuracies in this biopic, from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later life with Desi. I can easily point out numerous factual errors, but the list would be endless. Ultimately, I feel that Lucille Ball is a unique individual who can only be authentically portrayed by herself. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be upset by the multitude of errors in this film. Despite the filmmakers' efforts, the movie comes across as extremely sloppy to me.", "The actress who played Lucille Ball in this movie, Rachel York, did not do a good job. The portrayal of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz by York and Danny Pino was disappointing. I recommend watching other shows like A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi or reading Lucille Ball's book for a better understanding of their lives. Another docudrama called \"Before the Laughter\" has a better casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz.", "This movie is a bloated production that lacks substance, despite its attractive cast. The plot is weak, the character dynamics feel forced, and the music is poorly matched. It tries to rely on good intentions, but ultimately falls short. Despite its historical significance due to Dorothy Stratten's involvement, it is not as memorable as Bogdanovich's earlier works. Overall, it's a harmless film, but not worth watching.", "This movie is Peter Bogdanovich's personal creation, a twist on his life where detectives take the spotlight. These suave detectives effortlessly romance stunning models, more akin to wealthy playboy filmmakers than actual crime-solvers. Bogdanovich penned the entire script, revealing his disconnect from everyday folk. They say write what you know, and he certainly did, resulting in a film that leaves the audience feeling bored, puzzled, and even envious. This gem might only appeal to those curious about Dorothy Stratten, tragically murdered shortly after filming. Yet, Patti Hanson steals the show, bringing her own flair to the screen. Stratten's presence feels forced, adding little to the already intricate plot. Ultimately, the characters are so distant from reality that only a select few could find any connection, like Manhattan magnates surrounded by supermodels. For everyone else, it's a dull snooze fest, a stark reminder of the perils of being out of touch. Bogdanovich may entertain a small circle with his in-jokes, but for the majority, it's just a yawn-inducing experience.", "Revised Passage:\n\nI had the privilege of seeing some of my favorite stars from 30 years ago, such as John Ritter, Ben Gazzara, and Audrey Hepburn. They looked absolutely radiant on screen. However, their talents were unfortunately underutilized, as they were not given compelling characters or memorable lines to work with. The lack of depth in their roles left me disengaged and indifferent to their characters' actions.\n\nWhile some of the supporting female roles, like Patty Henson and Colleen Camp, showcased competence and confidence in their smaller parts, it's a pity they didn't receive more opportunities to shine in higher-quality films. I was also disappointed that Dorothy Stratten, in her only significant film role, didn't have the chance to fully demonstrate her acting abilities.\n\nDespite the film having its share of fans, I approached it with an open mind, being a devoted Peter Bogdanovich admirer who has enjoyed his past works, such as \"The Cat's Meow\" and his early classics like \"Targets\" and \"Nickelodeon.\" It was incredibly surprising to find that this particular film struggled to keep my attention, as I found myself fighting to stay awake throughout.\n\nAn interesting coincidence is the film's concept of detectives and clients becoming romantically entangled within a detective agency, which was later echoed in the hit television series \"Moonlighting\" starring Bogdanovich's former girlfriend, Cybill Shepherd. However, the series distinguished itself by relying on clever dialogue, unlike this film that attempted to rely on slapstick humor and a limited supply of witty lines.\n\nIn conclusion, this film falls short of the brilliance of \"Paper Moon\" and merely offers a pale imitation of the classic \"What's Up, Doc?\"", "Those who are praising this movie seem to be overlooking its flaws. While the actors and technical crew perform competently, the film is ultimately let down by a poor script. Fans of the actors mentioned should consider watching their other works instead.", "Avoid casting models and Playboy bunnies in your films. Bob Fosse's \"Star 80,\" based on Dorothy Stratten's tragic story, is far more captivating than Dorothy herself on screen. Patty Hansen also lacks acting skills \u2013 her performance fell short of expectations. The movie failed to live up to the standards set by acclaimed works like \"Paper Moon\" and \"The Last Picture Show.\" Despite speculation that its release was hindered by controversy surrounding Stratten's death, its poor quality seems to be the actual reason.", "The stellar cast and vibrant New York City backdrop captivate us, yet the movie's downfall lies in its lack of substance: a romance devoid of meaningful dialogue, mirroring the superficiality of Hollywood. Woody Allen himself couldn't outshine Bogdonovich's creation, but the script's absence leaves us with an empty, soulless film.", "I found the movie \"They All Laughed\" on a heavily discounted VHS tape at a rental store, initially drawn to it by the impressive names on the cover like Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter, and Dorothy Stratten. The user rating on IMDb was 6.0, and it had received four stars in the \"Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003.\" Despite the positive references, I ultimately found the movie to be overrated and quite boring. The characters were poorly developed, and the storyline failed to evoke any laughter. The coincidences in the plot were unbelievable, and some character portrayals were far-fetched, like Ben Gazarra's excessively alluring character. The only notable aspects were the presence of Dorothy Stratten, Patti Hansen, Audrey Hepburn, and the song \"Amigo\" by Roberto Carlos. I will only keep this movie in my collection for these highlights, primarily Dorothy Stratten. Overall, I rate it a four out of ten.", "This movie is extremely terrible with multiple flaws such as comedic mishaps by John Ritter, actors delivering lines poorly, inadequate editing, and problematic sound mixing. The plot lacks direction and fails to engage the audience. Shockingly, even Dorothy Stratten, known for her subpar acting, is not the worst in this film, with at least three other actors performing worse. Patti Hansen's delivery lacks emotion, resembling Ben Stein's monotone speech, making one question her inner vitality. Even the director's children perform poorly, with one clearly reading lines from cue cards. The film's overall quality is so low that Peter Bogdanovich faced difficulties securing another project for four years. It is strongly advised to avoid watching it at all costs. If it appears in your TV guide, consider canceling your cable subscription. If a friend suggests it, reassess your friendship, and if your partner wants to view it, it might be time to find a new companion. Enduring this film again is compared to gouging one's eyes out with lawn darts, emphasizing its unbearable nature. In short, the movie is a catastrophe of immense proportions.", "I bought this video because I was intrigued by Dorothy Stratten. While it featured wonderful actors and actresses, there were so many subplots that it was hard to stay engaged. Unfortunately, the dialogue was a bit stiff and confusing, and the story felt all over the place, making it less believable. I was a little let down by what I think was one of Audrey Hepburn's final films. However, John Ritter remains my favorite in slapstick comedy, although he seemed a bit out of place in this movie.", "I might film a movie next weekend, although I'm working. I'm quite certain I can manage to squeeze it in. The individual behind this movie must have similarly found a way. Hopefully, the creators of this production have alternate jobs because it was terrible! It resembles a homemade video, and I doubt they spent more than $100 creating it. Utter garbage! Who allows this kind of thing to be released?!", "Pros: None\n\nCons: Everything\n\nPlot summary: So, get this - a female reporter picks up a hitchhiker who starts rambling about people getting taken out by zombies.\n\nReview: Let me tell you, The Zombie Chronicles is hands down the worst movie I've ever seen. This disaster was clearly made on a shoestring budget \u2013 I'd be surprised if they even spent 20 bucks on it. The acting is beyond atrocious, the gore is distastefully over-the-top, and frankly, I'm baffled as to how this movie ever saw the light of day. Trust me, steer clear of The Zombie Chronicles like it's a contagious disease.\n\nMy take: Interestingly enough, this cinematic mess was brought to you by a studio called Brain Damage Films. Well, their brains must've been mush to greenlight a catastrophe like this.\n\nRating: 1 out of 10 (If it was my call, this garbage fire would get a negative bajillion)", "To the talented team behind \"Zombie Chronicles,\" if you're reading this, I've got some friendly advice coming your way: \ud83d\ude0a\ud83e\udddf\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n1. Hey there! When crafting a \"Twist Ending\" flick, here's a hot tip - keep those close-ups of EVERY DEATH out of the opening credits! No spoilers, right? Let's keep those twists fresh and surprising!\n\n2. I applaud your creativity and resourcefulness in bringing this film to life on a shoestring budget. But hey, consider beefing up your cast with folks who can really deliver those lines with gusto. We need actors who can walk, talk, and emote all at once. (Yes, Joe Haggerty, looking at you!)\n\n3. Ah, time-traveling in films - an ambitious move! But if you're diving into the past, make sure you've got the right props and costumes to transport us there seamlessly.\n\n4. Ah, the art of the twist ending! It's all about the element of surprise, right? Keep us on our toes, but don't give away the big reveal too soon! Let that twist hit us like a speeding zombie - unexpected and thrilling.\n\nWhile I appreciate the effort, maybe this one's just for the die-hard zombie fans out there. Keep refining your craft, and who knows - your next project might just be a blockbuster hit! \ud83e\udddf\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udca5\ud83c\udfac", "Movie watched on 8/3/2003 - Rated 2 out of 10. Directed by Brad Sykes. A mindless 3-D film featuring flesh-eating zombies in a three-part story. The film focuses more on showing zombies eating human flesh in 3D rather than developing a compelling storyline like the original zombie classics. The slow-paced and predictable finales make the movie boring. The final story, which revolves around a reporter investigating a ghost town, is lackluster. Skip this 3D film and watch the classics instead.", "There are many attractive women in this movie, but unfortunately, it does not feature any nudity. Strike one. \n\nMoving on, one of the storylines is set in 1971, so it's puzzling why the main characters are driving a modern Kia Sportage. It's a continuity error that stands out. \n\nThis film was released in stereoscopic 3D, but the 3D effects are poorly executed. The result is more like double-vision blurs rather than a true 3D experience. Even compared to the company's other 3D movies like HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD, the effects in this one fall short. \n\nOverall, this movie falls flat and doesn't offer much substance. On a positive note, the actress who portrayed the daughter of the ear-eating woman stood out. She has a captivating presence reminiscent of a young Janet Margolin.", "A female reporter encounters a peculiar hitch-hiker while on her way to a remote town that appears oddly close to a freeway. The hitch-hiker offers to guide her to her destination and shares two chilling tales related to the area: one involving an adulterous couple attacked by a zombie after plotting to kill the woman's husband, and another where campers disturb an undead outlaw's grave, cutting their vacation short. Although The Zombie Chronicles by Garrett Clancy and Brad Sykes aims to create a zombie-themed anthology, its limited content falls short. The film disappoints with poor acting, uninspired locations, a lackluster script, a non-nude sex scene, and a perplexing ending. Despite some effective camera work and enthusiastic gore effects, such as ear-biting, eyeball plucking, face removal, brain squishing, and decapitation, the movie is hard to endure even for fans of low-budget horror. I rate The Zombie Chronicles 2/10 but bump it up to 3 for the absence of 3D, although this likely wouldn't have drastically changed the viewing experience.", "Brad Sykes is behind two really boring and clich\u00e9d films I've seen - this one and Camp Blood. The acting is terrible, the quality is poor, and overall, this film is disappointing. It's like a challenge for us to make better zombie videos for YouTube. I paid \u00a31 for this, but your time is more valuable than wasting it on this bad movie. It's best to steer clear of it, even at a low price.", "My girlfriend thought it would be funny to bring over The Zombie Chronicles for us to watch, but it turned out to be a regrettable decision as the movie was incredibly bad. While watching it, I made a mental list of activities I would have preferred to do instead, such as drinking bleach or doing tax returns. The film was full of mistakes and was deemed the worst I had ever seen, even worse than White Noise: The Light. The director, Garrett Clancy, also known as Sgt. Ben Draper, did not impress with his work. Even Owen Wilson reportedly attempted suicide after watching it. My girlfriend left the movie at my place, leaving me embarrassed to own such a terrible piece of cinema. In conclusion, I strongly advise against watching this film.", "Amateur, low-budget films can sometimes be surprisingly good, but unfortunately, this one falls short.\n\nThis movie, created by Brad Sykes, has poor acting overall, except for Emmy Smith who shows some potential. The camera work needs significant improvement, and the handheld camera running scenes are ineffective. The special effects lack creativity and are easily identifiable, which takes away from the realism. Additionally, there are issues with visible body parts during gory scenes. The scenery is dull and uninspiring, as seen in Sykes' other projects, and the music is a mix of cheap-sounding tunes reminiscent of adult films and poorly executed guitar-driven metal tracks.\n\nThe film lacks a coherent plot and character development, indicating a failure in the scriptwriting process. The lack of progression in Sykes' filmmaking skills is evident, as seen in his previous works. There is a plea to stop funding his projects due to their consistent poor quality.\n\nIt's clear that this film is not even worth watching casually, as even eating unpopped popcorn kernels would be preferable. One notable low point is the poorly executed military push-ups scene.\n\nAward: The worst ever military push-ups in a film.", "While not the most outstanding cinematic work, the film has intrigued me enough to view it twice. The storyline may have its shortcomings, as I found myself questioning its direction during the initial stages of the first short film. Nevertheless, I found the film strangely appealing, with its humor providing a source of entertainment.<br /><br />Jebidia's performance in the movie deserves acclaim, warranting consideration for an accolade such as an Oscar. However, his portrayal was slightly flawed by the discontinuation of his whimsical name-calling halfway through the movie.<br /><br />In conclusion, the film may be deemed somewhat lacking, yet it delivers moments of levity suitable for those seeking inexpensive amusement. If encountered at a reasonable price, such as at Poundland, it may be worth considering a purchase.", "Some movies you score for a pound can be surprisingly good - 23rd Century productions dropped a plethora of hidden gems from Italy and America that wowed audiences. Despite Hardgore releasing a few Fulci films and others, most of their releases are more like stinkers such as The Zombie Chronicles.<br /><br />The only saving grace of this film is that it's not as irritating as the Stink of Flesh. Otherwise, it's a clumsily made anthology with the technical quality of a Lego house built by a sea snail.<br /><br />This film has been criticized for showing too much action in the opening credits, leaving nothing to the imagination when the zombie attacks finally come. Bad movie aficionados will delight in spotting the 18,000 continuity errors and revel in the horrendous acting by the cast (especially the hitchhiker, who was so awful he managed to elicit a chuckle or two). Kudos to Hardgore for embracing the film's spirit by offering a print that feels like a worn-out home video from a camping trip.<br /><br />Absolutely dreadful. We've all produced something resembling this when we got our hands on a camera, but most of us had the sense to keep those projects hidden in the dark corners of our closets. Steer clear of this one.", "I received this movie as a gift and anticipated it would be bad based on the DVD cover. After more than a year of avoiding watching it, I finally did and found it to be quite disappointing. While I almost didn't finish the film due to its poor quality, I felt it was necessary to watch it completely before forming an opinion. To put it bluntly, the movie is terrible. It's surprising that such a poorly made film was even financed. It seems like it was produced on a very low budget, likely not exceeding $20,000, using basic equipment like a camcorder or cell phone camera, with amateur actors and a poorly written script.\n\nThe story follows a reporter named Tara Woodley who accidentally hits a man while on her way to report on a haunted town. The man is unharmed and they find a conveniently furnished abandoned house with a bottle of liquor on the doorstep. As they explore the house, the man begins telling Tara ghost and zombie stories, with one particularly absurd tale about a soldier named Sgt. Ben Draper. In this story, Sgt. Draper is responsible for the death of a soldier named Private Wilson, who rises from the grave as a zombie seeking revenge on those involved in his death. The twist ending of the story is unsatisfying.\n\nEven if you enjoy B-horror movies, it's best to steer clear of this film.", "I haven't watched many low-budget films, but this one is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. The main character, an elderly man, spoke as if he had undergone a lobotomy and could only utter one word every 5 seconds. A 5-year-old could have delivered a better performance. The storyline was incredibly awful, and the character playing the soldier attempted to be realistic but ended up going way overboard. I only continued watching to chuckle at the sheer terribleness of it all, hoping it would eventually improve. I can't believe this movie was even available for a 2-night rental at Blockbusters; it should have been a \"please take this for free and remove it from our store\" situation. I think there was one somewhat competent actor, aside from the female lead. The only decent aspect of the production was the makeup, but they gave away all the important scenes in the opening credits. Absolutely dreadful.", "This movie may not be suitable for typical film enthusiasts as it lacks clarity and consistency in its storyline. The abrupt shifts in time periods, poor acting, and reliance on 3D effects for attention make it more of a B-movie or \"bad movie\" choice. If you prefer films by Goddard and Antonioni, this movie is not recommended.", "You can't help but admire Brad Sykes, a man who keeps cranking out low-budget horror movies despite receiving less-than-enthusiastic reactions. He soldiers on, relentless and determined. Even the faint praise for his Camp Blood films is begrudgingly given, and I'm just as guilty of it as anyone else. Despite his limitations, Brad always manages to inject something intriguing into his work - a unique concept, a quirky character, among other things. With minimal resources, he relies on the audience to understand and appreciate his vision for what it is and what it could potentially become.\n\nJoe Haggerty delivers a lively and comical performance as Ebenezer Jackson, and it's a testament to Sykes' intuition that he recognized this eccentric portrayal would fit seamlessly into the film's framework. Coming soon to a theater near you - at least in a parallel universe!", "Summary: In the movie \"The Zombie Chronicles,\" a young reporter goes on a quest to find a ghost town and encounters a hitchhiker who shares two stories about zombies. However, the film is criticized for having amateurish acting, routine storytelling, and lackluster direction. The 3-D format is also deemed as a wasted opportunity.", "A woman seeks directions to a mysterious town and is told two zombie stories by a local weirdo. However, \"The Zombie Chronicles\" film is terrible, with inappropriate scenes, amateur acting, and poor quality. It is filled with dull moments, lacks zombie action, and looks outdated, filmed like a low-budget YouTube video from the 70s. Save yourself the torture and avoid this laughable horror movie. Rating: 0/10.", "I am astonished that I ended up spending $5 on the movie. As a dedicated fan of zombies, I had high hopes that the movie would be worth the watch. However, to my disappointment, it turned out to be a complete letdown. While the movie did have some redeeming moments, such as the intense scene where a character's head was violently torn off, there wasn't much else to capture my interest. Overall, I would rather subject myself to sliding down a razorblade slide with bare skin into a vat of vinegar than endure watching this movie again.\n\nIf there had been some gratuitous nudity included, it might have helped salvage the viewing experience, but alas, I had to resort to checking out the previews of other films produced by the same company for that. In conclusion, potential buyers should be cautious unless they have a peculiar inclination towards enjoying pain and suffering.", "I viewed this film approximately three years ago, which continues to stand out in my memory as the epitome of the worst cinematic creation ever produced. The viewing experience was so dismal that I doubt I even managed to endure it until the end. This film is of inferior quality, equivalent to a homemade video fashioned by an amateur high school student. Notably, there was a scene within this film attempting to depict the 1970s era, featuring a character clad in a polo shirt and Oakley sunglasses driving what seemed to be a relatively modern SUV, possibly a Toyota Rav-4. The nonsensical portrayal of this character, potentially equipped with a cell phone, further solidifies the ineptitude of the production. The sheer absurdity of such an inaccurate representation left me flabbergasted. Subsequently, I promptly returned the film to the video store, questioning the rationale behind stocking such a subpar creation and inquiring if it was possible to reclaim the valuable hour wasted on viewing it. To date, this film remains etched in my mind as the ultimate testament to a cinematic failure, surpassing the numerous lackluster creations that have crossed my path.", "I was quite disappointed with Love's Abiding Joy, which I had been eagerly anticipating. Upon watching it during its recent airing on Hallmark, I found it to be quite different from what I expected. The film was rather somber and filled with numerous mistakes. The editing was subpar, with many scenes feeling out of place. The premature death of baby Kathy and Clark's presence seemed out of sync. The actors appeared lackluster, lacking emotional depth, and there was a notable absence of interaction between Missie and Willie.\n\nIn my opinion, the scriptwriters should have adhered more closely to the source material. It appears that each movie strays further from Janette Oke's original writings. The film omitted crucial elements from the book, such as the mine incident involving the two boys and Clark's injury. I believe the reactions of Missie and Willie to Kathy's death should have been portrayed rather than just mentioned.\n\nAmong the four movies produced thus far, Love's Abiding Joy ranks as my least favorite. For future installments, I hope there will be a more faithful adaptation from the books. If Clark's character reappears, I wish for a more significant role with greater depth. I also anticipate more screen time for Scottie, Cookie, and possibly Marty. However, the direction of the upcoming films remains uncertain, and we can only wait to see what the scriptwriters have in store.", "The movie \"Love's Abiding Joy\" strays far from the original book, lacking accurate character details and storyline. It does a disservice to Janette Oke, her fans, and her work. The music is too loud, and the actors lack emotion. It may work as a clean family movie, but not as an adaptation of the book. It is hoped that future movies in the series will stay closer to the original plot and storyline for a more faithful adaptation.", "I was really looking forward to this movie! It's a nice family flick, but I think if Michael Landon Jr.'s editing team stepped up their game, the movie could be even better. There were too many scenes that felt out of place. I'm hoping there's another movie in the series because I've enjoyed them all so far. But if they do make another one, please, please pay more attention to the editing. The storyline felt all over the place and lacking focus, which is a shame because the previous movies in the series were fantastic. I love the characters Willie and Missy; they're such strong role models. And who doesn't love a good love story, right?", "I have read all the Love Come Softly books, and I was highly disappointed in the movie adaptation. The only similarity with the book is that Missy's father visits, unlike the book where both parents come. The movie's storyline was far-fetched and too sad compared to the book. The overall tone of the movie was bleak, even for a pioneer life setting. The film receives some credit for maintaining the family-oriented theme seen in the books, but it did not capture the essence of the original story.", "\"Despite my deep appreciation for Christian movies, I must say that \"Love's Abiding Joy\" falls short of my expectations. It's clear that there is a passion for depicting Christian themes on screen, and while I applaud the effort, the execution in this particular film lacks a certain polish. The storyline is somewhat predictable, the performances are passable, and the editing could use some work. While it may have its place as a TV movie, as a feature film it leaves much to be desired. I encourage filmmakers to continue exploring the world of Christian cinema, perhaps drawing inspiration from literary giants like G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis. There's great potential here, so keep pushing boundaries and striving for excellence!\"", "As a child, I found the weapon brandished by the murderer to be fascinating, despite my naivety back then. Even in my youthful ignorance, I couldn't help but feel that the movie's plot was lackluster and unengaging whenever the killer wasn't utilizing his signature light knife to dispatch victims. It's perplexing to see such a formidable cast involved in a production that seems to revolve solely around showcasing a miniature lightsaber. The narrative is often convoluted, culminating in a chaotic and incomprehensible ending that centers on extraterrestrial beings and the enigmatic weapon.\n\nThe story follows two youngsters and an individual who have an encounter with aliens, only to have the mysterious weapon resurface years later, triggering a series of bizarre events that involve the weapon being used for a seemingly benign killing spree. The film begs the question of its purpose, failing to deliver on impactful death scenes, elaborate alien encounters, or fully embracing its light saber theme akin to the iconic \"Star Wars\" franchise.", "The movie is about a woman named Jill Dunne, who is dealing with a disrespectful daughter named Liv and a deceitful husband named Sean. The family is targeted by a killer during a storm. However, most of the film focuses on Jill arguing with Liv and dealing with Sean's behavior. As the story progresses, Jill discovers Sean's infidelity, but their marital issues are unresolved. Eventually, the family goes on a camping trip, leading to more conflict. Despite the thrilling premise, the suspenseful moments are minimal until the end.", "This movie was terrible. The acting, plot, and premise were all awful. Skip it, don't waste your time.", "Lifetime has missed the mark once again with their latest production. The plot was nonsensical, the acting was subpar - particularly from the teenage actors, and the storyline felt overused and tired. Despite promising previews, this supposed thriller fell flat. Although Lifetime occasionally delivers good movies, this certainly wasn't one of them. I recommend steering clear of this film unless you have absolutely nothing else to do. Personally, I felt like I wasted two hours of my life watching it. I'd rather spend that time scraping my face against a brick wall and then soaking it in peroxide - at least that would be more entertaining!", "I must admit, I was genuinely taken aback by the high ratings this movie received. To me, it felt entirely nonsensical. I mean, the idea that the mother suddenly develops \"visions\" by touching random things or people? And then, touching something twice makes the vision persist... It all just felt incredibly absurd. Deedee Pfieffer's performance was particularly lacking, in my opinion. Her portrayal was quite grating. On a positive note, the girl who played Lori delivered a solid performance, as did most of the supporting cast, given the material they had to work with.<br /><br />As a fan of LMN, I usually have a very broad taste when it comes to movies, but this one seemed to push the boundaries of believability with its outlandish plot and exaggerated acting. Ultimately, it simply didn't resonate with me.", "The original book was based in the 1950s, but for the TV series, it was transformed to embody the 1930s style that most viewers prefer. Interestingly, the tube train near the end was a clever disguise - a 1950s train made to appear like a 1930s train, allowing the Underground to participate in the era's aesthetic. While the storyline revolving around the Jarrow March felt weak, the inclusion of students grappling with social issues added depth. The portrayal of Japp needing to fend for himself was lackluster, serving as mere filler. This episode could have been a compelling half-hour show or a more engaging long-form series if they had stuck closer to the original book. Ultimately, this episode falls victim to prioritizing style over substance.", "The repetitive use of the annoying mouse and lullaby was unnecessary and seemed amateurish, much like something from my early days in film school. The story felt dragged out with too many irrelevant elements, giving the impression that the creative team lacked direction or could have benefited from a shorter format. After binge-watching all the episodes up to this point in a week, I must warn others that this was the weakest one and suggest starting elsewhere.", "I watched this movie on its opening weekend in Australia, excited to see a great cast including Ledger, Edgerton, Bloom, Watts, and Rush telling the story of Ned Kelly. Unfortunately, even though Heath Ledger delivered an outstanding performance as the lead, the storyline was quite weak. This doesn't make me eager to read \"Our Sunshine.\" There were some positives though, like Edgerton's supporting acting, Jordan's solid direction (which he also showed in Buffalo Soldiers), and the realistic production design of the Australian bush. However, it feels like a missed opportunity to truly capture the essence of this Australian legend, possibly due to trying to cater to Hollywood and the US audience. I'm glad they didn't compromise on the authenticity of the beards just to please Universal though.<br /><br />I guess I'll have to settle for reading Peter Carey's fantastic novel \"Secret History of the Kelly Gang\" instead. I'd rate the movie 4 out of 10.", "I witnessed this during its premiere in Melbourne. \n\nThe film is deemed to be lacking depth and fails to leave a lasting impact. Despite having competent actors, they were hindered by a slow-paced and unimpressive screenplay. The narrative lacks substantial literary qualities and solely thrives on conventional characterizations. Regrettably, it falls short of being an entertaining popcorn flick due to its uneven pacing and subpar execution. \n\nIt is improbable that Gregor Jordan could reflect and acknowledge that he maximized the potential of the source material. \n\nNed Kelly remains a captivating historical figure, with a complex significance in Australian folklore. While seen as a potential folk hero, social crusader, and possibly a disturbed individual, Ned Kelly has maintained a prominent position in Australian folklore for more than a century. Once again, his cinematic portrayal has failed to resonate effectively. \n\nSuch is the nature of life.", "Ned Kelly (Ledger), an infamous Australian outlaw, is depicted in the movie as a mix of Robin Hood and Billy the Kid, known for rebelling against English aristocratic oppression. The film portrays a romanticized version of history, emphasizing legends over facts. Despite a slow-paced plot, the performances and direction fall short, with exaggerated accents and unconvincing storytelling. The excessive nature shots and irrelevant scenes make it a tedious watch, rendering it a forgettable historical drama better suited for television.", "They created a fantasy film reminiscent of \"Man From Snowy River\" and \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\" featuring Ned and Joe getting involved with wealthy older men's wives. Despite the many myths about Ned Kelly, there are well-documented facts that leave room for artistic interpretation. This story is not a legend lost in time but rather a recent historical event. The movie failed to do justice to the true Kelly story, unlike Peter Carey's novel \"The True History of the Kelly Gang.\" Surprisingly, Mick Jagger's 1970 portrayal was perhaps more accurate and a better film overall. A disappointing watch, but at least it was only a two-dollar rental. I'd rate it 3/10, mostly for the scenic shots of the Australian outback.", "This movie was extremely disappointing. Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom, who are thought to be heartthrobs, did not meet expectations. Rachel Griffiths was great as usual, but Geoffrey Rush's performance seemed lacking. The film failed to engage the audience and was filled with clich\u00e9s, making it a tedious watch. The final scenes, which were meant to be serious, ended up being unintentionally funny. Overall, the film was a waste of time, leaving many viewers dissatisfied with their experience.", "Ned Kelly could be called an \"Australian Western\" if the term made sense. He was seen as a heroic outlaw similar to Robin Hood and other famous bandits. Kelly, an Irish immigrant, became a fugitive and outlaw after being wrongly accused of shooting an Australian law officer. In retaliation, he and his group robbed banks to protest the mistreatment of Irish immigrants in Australia.\n\nThe movie \"Ned Kelly\" follows the typical storyline of a sympathetic outlaw facing off against authorities. It includes clich\u00e9s like the good-hearted criminal and a romanticized portrayal of robbery. While the film tries to depict Ned Kelly as a hero, it falls short due to a lackluster performance by Heath Ledger and a preachy narration.\n\nOverall, \"Ned Kelly\" may be informative about Australian history, but it's essentially a rehash of familiar themes with an Australian setting.", "This movie was incredibly disappointing; it felt like a project put together by inexperienced junior high students trying their hand at filmmaking. The lack of coherence in directing, editing, production, and scripting made it hard to believe what I was watching. Critical elements such as narrative flow, character development, and emotional arcs were poorly executed, leaving scenes feeling disconnected and relationships lacking depth. Despite some decent acting, the subpar writing overshadowed the performances. The film resembled a low-quality TV western, failing to properly capture the intriguing true story it aimed to tell. While some may argue its significance to Australians due to the subject matter, the overall quality of the movie remains deficient. Just because a historical figure like Ned Kelly is important doesn't automatically make the movie good. It falls short on all fronts, except for the attractive leads played by Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom.", "This movie skipped theaters in our area, but once it hit DVD, I eagerly grabbed a copy. However, I quickly realized I should have heeded the critics' warnings and given it a pass! \ud83d\udca5 Despite the star-studded cast, the film was a major letdown - no wonder it went straight to video. \ud83d\ude14 I had high hopes with Bloom, Ledger, and Rush on board, as they've all delivered stellar performances in the past. But sadly, the movie was a slow burn that failed to capture my interest. I struggled to connect with the characters and found myself tempted to fast-forward just to reach the end. \ud83c\udfac I wouldn't recommend this film, not even for a dose of 'eye candy' - it falls short on every front. \ud83d\udc4e", "Key points emphasized:\n\nThis version of a famous Australian story lacks engagement and feels forced and mechanical. The actors Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom give their characters personality. However, the beginning could have been more captivating by starting with a shootout and incorporating flashbacks. Every scene felt predictably signposted, resembling a bad TV soap. Despite high expectations, the movie falls short, only slightly surpassing the Mick Jagger version.", "The Ned Kelly saga holds great relevance for Australians, yet this film is utterly disappointing. Despite being an Australian narrative, it feels strangely transplanted to an American setting. Furthermore, Ned Kelly, an iconic Australian figure, inexplicably possesses an Irish accent in this film. Overall, this movie ranks as the most dreadful I have watched in a considerable amount of time.", "Right from the start, this film boldly presents a heavy-handed political narrative that leaves little room for surprises. Unlike the well-advised approach of crafting layered characters with evolving arcs in three acts, this film opts for a simplistic portrayal. The police are portrayed as shallow, inept antagonists, devoid of any depth or nobility one might expect. Rather than exploring the complexities of Ned Kelly's character, the film rushes into scenes without offering insight into his true nature. The constant solemn gazes from Ned Kelly towards the camera, coupled with the uninspiring direction, made viewing this film a tedious task that discouraged further engagement with modern cinema.", "I was drawn to this movie because of the intriguing storyline and the talented lead actor, so I decided to give it a try. Directed by Gregor Jordan (Buffalo Soldiers), the film follows Ned Kelly (played by Heath Ledger) who is framed by the police, led by Superintendent Francis Hare (Geoffrey Rush). Kelly is forced to flee, form a gang, and confront the authorities to clear his name and protect his family. Although I wasn't fully engaged while watching, I can share that the cast includes Orlando Bloom as Joseph Byrne, Naomi Watts as Julia Cook, and other actors such as Laurence Kinlan, Philip Barantini, Joel Edgerton, Kiri Paramore, Kerry Condon, Emily Browning, and Rachel Griffiths. Ledger delivers a solid performance, and there are some visually striking moments in the film, notably a gun battle towards the climax. However, my lack of full attention prevented me from fully enjoying the movie.", "I didn't understand the rating for The Amati Girls and I was being generous by giving it a 4 out of 10. What could have been a nice story with decent actors turned out to be a total mess in my opinion. The movie is full of clich\u00e9s, bad hair, and unrealistic scenes. The actors seem to be overdoing it without any real passion. It's not funny enough to be a comedy and too artificial to evoke any real emotion. I couldn't believe I was watching it on my TV in Switzerland. Maybe it just didn't translate well? Overall, it's one of the weirdest movies I've seen, and not in a good way. I'm sorry.", "The movie was terrible, especially the ending. It lacked a coherent plot, and the only redeeming quality was the exceptional performances by Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones. However, their talents were not showcased well due to the weak script. Despite their remarkable acting, the movie failed to deliver a compelling storyline. The characters were unremarkable, with the exception of DuVall's portrayal of a disoriented old man. The entire film felt aimless, with no significant events or developments. After enduring the entire film, it was evident that it offered no meaningful plot or depth. The story unfolded over just one day on a Southern plantation, limiting the potential for a compelling narrative. Despite the strong performances by the cast, the film ultimately fell short of being a worthwhile watch.", "Oh man, that movie was terrible! The performances were decent, but there was no plot at all. It was just a bunch of clowns chatting about random stuff. Robert Duvall's character was so annoying, asking the same questions repeatedly. The film only got a pass because of the famous actors in it. Overall, it was a complete mess. Nothing really happened - total waste of time!", "SWING! is a significant film as it stands out as one of the few Black-produced and enacted movies surviving from the 1930s. While many films from that era have deteriorated beyond watchability, SWING! is a commendable exception, preserved in fairly good condition. It offers a delightful opportunity to witness the talents of numerous Black performers post the peak of the old Cotton Club era, a time often overlooked today.\n\nHowever, despite its historical importance and noteworthy performances, SWING! falls short in many areas. The main plot closely resembles the typical Hollywood musicals of its time, featuring a troublesome prima donna set on sabotaging the show, and an unknown individual who miraculously saves the day. Nevertheless, the screenplay is poorly crafted and occasionally descends into trashiness, projecting derogatory images of Black America that may cause offense. The introduction of a lazy husband living off his hardworking wife, paired with exaggerated performances, sets an unsavory tone. The film further falters with scenes reminiscent of WWE Smackdown and an appalling instance of domestic violence applauded by the crowd.\n\nDespite these flaws, if you can overlook its subpar production quality, poorly developed characters, amateur acting, and weak direction, SWING! might still hold some value. It presents remarkable singing and tap dancing performances and offers a window into a forgotten facet of Black culture. Proceed with caution, though, as the acting is truly cringe-worthy!", "\"The Sunshine Boys\" is a comedy adapted by Neil Simon, where old age is depicted as irrational and mean-spirited behavior. Walter Matthau portrays an aged vaudeville performer convinced to reunite with former partner George Burns for a television special. Despite Burns entering the film after about thirty minutes, Matthau's performance overshadows the material. The film becomes increasingly noisy and less enjoyable, with director Herbert Ross failing to deliver successful gags. Matthau, although too young for the role, exaggerates his performance. The film lacks brightness and moves slowly, leading to early disappointment.", "I bought the film \"Protocol\" starring Goldie Hawn at Walmart for $5.50, hoping for another great movie from her. However, while mildly amusing, the film never truly finds its rhythm. Certain scenes, like a drawn-out party scene in a bar, feel unnecessary and drag on for too long. The preachy scene at the end of the film leaves a bad taste in my mouth, as I believe it added little to the overall movie. I'm not a fan of comedies that try to teach lessons, especially when written by someone stuck in the '60s! In the end, although I'm happy to add another Goldie Hawn film to my collection, I question if it was truly worth the money spent.", "\"Get ready for a rollercoaster ride with Protocol, a movie that may surprise you! Featuring the legendary Goldie Hawn and a stellar cast, this film follows the journey of a quirky cocktail waitress who finds herself thrust into the limelight after a chance encounter with an Arab dignitary. While the plot may take a surprising turn halfway through, Goldie's infectious charm continues to shine. If you're a fan of Goldie Hawn or just looking for some entertainment, Protocol is worth a watch!\"", "The role of an \"Executive Producer\" in a movie typically involves securing financial backing for the film. In many movies starring Sean Connery, he also serves as the executive producer, indicating his involvement in raising funds due to his significant influence in the industry. However, when the executive producer is also the star of the movie, it often suggests that the film is primarily a platform to showcase that star, rather than focusing on a strong storyline or screenplay.\n\nIn the case of the movie \"PROTOCOL,\" the story follows Sunny Davis, a quirky cocktail waitress who becomes a diplomat after saving a dignitary. As the plot unfolds, Davis faces increasingly improbable situations. The fact that Goldie Hawn stars in and executive produces the film further emphasizes the concern that the story and screenplay may not meet the desired standards.", "Unbelievable concept lacking credibility and failing to generate humor or engage viewers. It is Goldie Hawn's likability alone that saves it from total failure. Goldie's impressive career has thrived despite a lack of quality material.", "There are only two movies that deserve a 1/10 rating in my book: this disaster and \"The Man who Fell to Earth.\" I vividly recall watching Protocol at a packed theater in the early 80s during my high school days. The screenplay is so mind-numbingly dull that it insults the intelligence of anyone (even a high school student). It completely lost me with its attempt at humor involving someone getting shot in the rear end. Goldie Hawn's character is supposed to be charming but instead comes off as vacuous and foolish. The film shamelessly perpetuates offensive stereotypes about Arabs, only for Goldie to win the audience over with populist nonsense. The performances are abysmal, including Goldie Hawn's. I swore off watching any of her movies until, in my opinion, she redeemed herself in Everyone Says I Love You. Protocol represents laziness in screenplay writing at its peak. It's simply the worst kind of movie - one that requires little to no effort to make.", "One memorable scene from this movie features Goldie Hawn standing in a French-cut bikini, playfully fending off other women as they try to remove her cotton top. This scene made quite an impression on me when I first saw it at fourteen. I recently came across it on TV, where they blurred her midsection, but it served as a reminder of Goldie Hawn's allure in the '80s. Kurt Russell must have had an exciting time being with her.", "The writer discovered the Catalan-language film \"El Mar\" at an art-house video store and although appreciating its technical aspects and cinematography, was ultimately unsettled by the graphic content and found some of the characters and their actions bewildering. The story follows three children who survived a violent incident and reunite as adults, with one becoming a nun and the others as tuberculosis patients. The film features excessive violence and dark themes reminiscent of older exploitation movies, with characters' motivations and interactions often feeling disjointed. The reviewer suggests that the film lacks sufficient character development and may not appeal to those seeking a coherent and uplifting narrative. Additionally, it is noted that the film uses the Mallorqui dialect of Catalan, distinct from the Barcelona dialect, with even native Barcelonans possibly requiring subtitles to understand certain parts of the dialogue.", "I eagerly anticipated watching a Catalu\u00f1a's film in the Berlin competition. However, after the screening, I was completely disappointed and furious! The film was a chaotic mix of excessive blood, prolonged runtime, and meaningless themes. While it explored aspects like the Spanish Civil War and human revenge \u2013 familiar subjects in many films and plays, the portrayal was lackluster. Mr. Villaronga's attempt at a pseudo-tragedy falls flat and does a disservice to the history of cinema. It's disheartening to see Angela Molina in such a production. My recommendation is to steer clear of this film at all costs!", "This film was a major letdown due to its disturbingly high levels of cruelty, violence, and mean-spiritedness. The characters were unsympathetic, with the lead protagonist being particularly slimy. The over-the-top theatrics in the sickroom/house atmosphere left little room for a meaningful exploration of the Spanish civil war. The portrayal of same-sex attraction as a lurid \"horror\" was offensive and poorly executed. The actors appeared uncomfortable in their roles, seemingly trying to distance themselves from the film. Overall, the film relies on brutal scenes of violence against children and pets, making it a potentially appealing choice only for those who enjoy such content.", "A three-part \"horror\" film unfolds within the confines of a boarded-up house, as an unknown individual pleads with viewers to avoid venturing \"out there.\" Regrettably, the narrative weaves three tales to substantiate the warning.\n\nIn the initial segment, a young couple entwines with two deranged individuals following a car accident, culminating in two unsurprising plot twists. Despite its brevity (clocking in at approximately 15 minutes), the sequence proves to be swift, brutal, and skillfully executed. While its predictability is evident, the overall experience remains engaging.\n\nThe subsequent storyline centers on a man fleeing with ill-gotten gains, only to face a series of unfortunate events when his vehicle malfunctions, leading him to a local medical facility where danger lurks. The execution is glaringly overt, poorly developed, and frustratingly slow-paced, stretching to an arduous 30-minute runtime. Notably, commendable performances elevate an otherwise lackluster narrative.\n\nLastly, a narrative that teeters on the edge of horror unfolds, following an enchanting yet solitary woman in pursuit of her ideal partner. Displaying lavish set designs, an evocative atmosphere, and a sensuous interlude, the plot maintains an aura of beauty but lacks genuine fright. Once more, the outcome unfolds predictably without instilling a sense of unease.\n\nUltimately, the film concludes in an unsatisfactory manner. While the initial segment offers some semblance of entertainment value, the remainder falls short. Viewers are advised to focus on the first story and subsequently disengage from the film.", "- A very cheesy and dull road movie intended to be hip and modern, but only resulting in sleepiness.\n- The cast is wasted, the writing is stupid and pretentious.\n- The only highlights are the top-notch Lalo Schifrin's soundtrack and the original opening sequence.\n- Overall, the bad opinions and comments about this flick are totally deserved; it is really pure garbage.", "The film has nice cinematography, but lacks subtitles for key plot points, leaving non-Spanish speakers confused. Matthew McConaughey has a minor role despite being marketed as a star. Patrick McGaw shines as the lead actor. \"Scorpion Spring\" is worth watching but doesn't stand out. Recommended McConaughey films include \"A Time to Kill,\" \"The Newton Boys,\" \"Frailty,\" \"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days,\" \"Edtv,\" and \"Amistad.\" Avoid \"Larger Than Life\" and \"Angels in the Outfield\" unless looking for children's movies.", "I have been searching for this film for a long time as it is considered rare due to being part of the video nasties. Finally, towards the end of last year, I found it on DVD. It is a low-budget movie set in the Amazon jungle, focusing on tribes living in fear of the devil. The story follows Laura Crawford, a model who gets kidnapped by a gang of thugs while working in South America. They take her into the jungle, where she is guarded by a native man who refers to himself as \"The Devil\". Laura undergoes various unpleasant experiences until her captors are satisfied \u2013 with maidens being chained up and the devil illustrating gruesome acts like consuming flesh. Peter Weston, a devil hunter, ventures into the jungle to attempt to rescue her.", "As I near the end of my Video Nasties list, I came across this terrible film about a kidnapped fashion model in the jungle with bad acting, dubbed voices, and gratuitous nudity, including explicit close-ups. It also features a poorly made-up cannibal cult leader. Not recommended unless you're a die-hard Video Nasties fan, and even then, save it for last - it's not representative of the list's quality.", "I'm uncertain whether my opinion is directed towards those who branded this movie as a video nasty or towards the director, but \"Devil Hunter\" is undeniably a peculiar 'horror' film. The storyline loosely mirrors esteemed movies like \"Cannibal Ferox\" and \"Cut and Run.\" It follows the abduction of a woman in a 'jungle' by a 'tribe' of 'savages', yet the jungle resembles more of a park in Mexico. The tribe appears more like hippies dressed in Party City-esque Halloween outfits imitating tribal attire. The savages display a range of ethnicities, from white to Asian, black, and Hispanic, suggesting a lack of cohesive casting. Adding to its faults, the movie is notably deficient in gore, lacking genuine scares, and gratuitously includes unnecessary male nudity. Unfortunately, there was little to enjoy in this production, falling significantly short of expectations, earning a disappointing rating of 2 out of 10.", "This controversial film was initially prohibited in Britain but was eventually approved in November without any edits.<br /><br />\nIt stars Ursula Buchfellner, the Playboy Playmate of the Month for October 1979. The beginning alternates between Buchfellner and misty jungle scenes, leaving the purpose unclear. Emphasizing the bathtub sequence would have been more effective.<br /><br />\nThe plot follows Laura (played by Buchfellner), who gets kidnapped and held captive in the jungle for ransom. Peter (Al Cliver - known for \"The Beyond\" and \"Zombie\") is assigned to rescue her and the ransom money. During this time, one of the kidnappers (Antonio de Cabo) makes the most of his time, while another (Werner Pochath) complains incessantly.<br /><br />\nThe ransom handover ends disastrously, and Laura escapes into the jungle. Can Peter reach her before the cannibals make her their next meal? Yes, there are cannibals in this story, which explains why it was considered controversial.

Peter leaves them and sets out alone to find Laura, who has already been captured. Ignoring the approaching danger, they engage in intimate activities. Expect visceral scenes such as a brutal fight between Peter and the nude antagonist (Burt Altman).<br /><br />\nThis film doesn't hold back on gore, including blood, decapitation, and intestines.

While some films on the list were there for unknown reasons, this one wasn't exactly a standout in terms of being outrageous. It's not the most mellow film, but it's not exactly the most ban-worthy either. Personally, I wouldn't have bothered watching it if it weren't for its notorious status.\n\nThe story sets a decent foundation for the film, especially compared to most cannibal movies out there. It follows an actress who gets kidnapped and taken into the Amazon jungle.

The design, animatronics, and overall execution are criticized for being subpar. The slow and unnatural lip syncing, the disrespect towards Shredder, and the corniness of the dragonlord character are highlighted as major flaws. The critic suggests that the episode could have been improved by having the characters behave more authentically, by eliminating Venus from the plot, and by enhancing the overall quality of the writing and animation.", "Since 1987, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have been known as four brothers - Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael, and Donatello - with their teacher Splinter and their ever-changing enemies. The introduction of a female turtle, Venus, in the new series does not contribute meaningfully to the story nor add excitement. The original TMNT series from 1987, with its familiar characters and new adversaries in each episode, was much better in comparison. Introducing a female turtle weakens the action and does not align with the engaging storytelling we enjoy. We hope for more new adventures in the TMNT series, but prefer to stick with the original characters from 1987 without the addition of a female turtle.", "Do not waste your time on this film.

Even an amateur with a camera could probably do better. <br/><br/>\nWhen it comes to acting, we might want to broaden our search beyond the supermarket. Great actors often come with experience or training! Now, onto the director, Mr. Jon Keeyes. Let's work together to find your strengths. Directing may not be your calling, but we can figure it out. Your angles might need a bit of tweaking, and the dialogue could use some finesse. And the music cues? Let's fine-tune those. Making movies is an art form that requires skill, and I believe in your potential to grow.<br/><br/>\nRather than a shootout flick, let's explore other creative avenues together. Maybe a fresh start is what we need. Consider trying something new or maybe taking a breather. Your hard work is appreciated, and I think you have more to offer!<br/><br/>\nRating: 1/10 (we all start somewhere!)", "I rented a DVD of this movie without any prior knowledge. Seeing Michael Madsen in a film I had never heard of made me suspicious, but since it was a freebie, I decided to give it a shot.\n\nIn hindsight, it seems like Mr. Blonde would likely want to erase any memory of being associated with such a poorly made film. The script and dialogs are terrible, and even the presence of good actors couldn't salvage the movie. The amateur actors featured in the film, particularly non-native English speakers attempting to portray native English speakers, only added to the lackluster experience. The dialogue feels unnatural and cringe-worthy, making it hard to believe anything happening in the movie. The music doesn't fit and overall, the production gives off a vibe reminiscent of a subpar school play.\n\nI suggest watching it just to gain an appreciation for better quality movies. This is why despite deserving a rating of 1, I gave it a 3.", "I stumbled upon this DVD at my friend's place, assuming it was a Turkish action flick featuring lesser-known Hollywood stars. Intrigued, I decided to give it a chance later on. However, watching it turned out to be quite a grueling ordeal. Initially, I scoffed at the thought of Turks attempting a Hollywood-style heist/hostage film, only to realize that the film was actually shot in America with an American director and crew. This revelation left me pondering how they managed to secure actors like Micheal Madsen, Edward Furlong, and Arnold Vosloo for this project \u2014 money, most likely. Delving deeper into my contemplation, I unraveled the secret behind securing a supposedly international cast: by cutting costs and hiring the most affordable equipment and crew available. The idea that the filmmakers may have also written and directed the movie themselves to stretch their budget further crossed my mind.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the movie wasn't as terrible as everyone claims. It prompts you to contemplate and reflect \u2014 a rare trait among contemporary films. It sparks curiosity, evokes disbelief, and encourages you to delve deeper into its narrative.", "What was the deal with all the Turkish actors? No offense, but it seemed like a wasted effort for them. The film lacked a solid script to challenge the actors' skills or showcase their talent. It provided very little substance; I specifically got the film to watch Michael Madsen, one of my favorite actors, but unfortunately, it turned out to be another disappointment for him. The script was atrocious, offering no depth or complexity for the characters. Madsen attempted to portray a tough character, but the weak script and direction limited his ability to bring depth and interest to the role.\n\nThe gunfight sound effects at the beginning of the film were unconvincing, resembling the noise of paintball guns in a skirmish rather than actual firearms. It was strange and lacked realism; even a video game would have better sound effects. Moreover, there was an irritating character in the robbery gang at the start of the film, whose high-pitched American accent made him sound like a girl while delivering lines such as \"Let's get the heck out of here\" and \"What are we gonna do, man?\" It was oddly amusing and elicited a brief chuckle. Overall, this film was silly and disappointing, especially for Madsen. Hopefully, he will recover from this setback.", "This movie didn't meet my expectations. Initially, I found the plot summary to be promising and decided to watch it. However, the acting was subpar, with the actors appearing uncomfortable in front of the camera, resulting in a lack of authenticity. I feel sorry for Edward Furlong, as I have fond memories of his performance in Terminator 2, a favorite of mine from years past that I've watched countless times.\n\nFurthermore, the plot itself was poorly constructed, with seemingly uninspired dialogue that may have been a result of the writers' lack of sleep.\n\nOn a positive note, despite its flaws, the movie falls into the category of being so bad that it becomes somewhat entertaining. It becomes the type of film you continue watching just to witness how much worse it can get, allowing you to later regale others with tales of its sheer terribleness.\n\nI believe everyone should watch this movie as a means to appreciate truly exceptional films even more.", "I am a huge admirer of Arnold Vosloo. It was a delight to finally see him take on a leading role in a recent movie, rather than just a minor part.<br /><br />However, having studied film appreciation in college, the one aspect that stood out to me negatively was the film's location in a deserted area without any background activity or bystanders.<br /><br />While the acting could have been better, Arnold's exceptional performance shines through. I attribute any shortcomings to poor direction and a supporting cast that falls short.<br /><br />I admire Arnold Vosloo greatly, and his presence in the film made it worth watching. Without him, I may have dismissed it as another disappointing movie.<br /><br />The rape scene was harsh and seemed unnecessary, although the actors who made it through to the end delivered solid performances. However, the sound effects during the shoot-out were subpar. Despite some continuity errors, these are forgivable given the film's overall quality.<br /><br />Overall, I found the film enjoyable, mainly due to Arnold Vosloo's involvement.<br /><br />Best regards, Jackie", "This is an artistic film produced either in 1969 or 1972, as noted by conflicting sources (the National Film Preservation Foundation cites 1969, whereas IMDb suggests 1972). Despite the ambiguity surrounding its exact year of creation, the film distinctly captures the essence of the late 1960s to early 1970s period. Its cinematography and pop art aesthetics embody the stylistic sensibilities of this era.\n\nComprising of three minimalist yet visually distorted images achieved through unconventional camera techniques, the film is enhanced by a musical accompaniment. Devoid of any dialogue or discernible narrative structure, it appears to be a deliberate exploration of performance art. The initial intrigue dissipates swiftly, leaving behind a monotonous experience. In essence, the film may only resonate with its creators, their acquaintances, and individuals considered avant-garde and ahead of their time, eluding conventional understanding.", "Nine minutes of trippy, swirling abstract images, sometimes even mirroring each other, can seriously mess with your head. I noticed a creepy eye right at the beginning, followed by some birds blending into different colors. Personally, it wasn't really my thing. Honestly, it felt like it went on for about 8 and a half minutes too long.", "This film boasts a plethora of stunning individuals that may captivate your attention. However, beneath the glamorous facade lies a lackluster script and an unengaging storyline. Despite some commendable performances, the overuse of distracting camera effects detracts from the viewing experience. While the cast shows promise, \"Loaded\" ultimately falls short of being a worthwhile watch. It's best to pass on this one, as it fails to deliver on its potential.", "This movie is the worst ever made. It goes beyond being bad and is an embarrassment to the art of filmmaking. It is so horrific that it questions humanity and our existence. The excessive use of cheesy editing effects and lack of originality make it unbearable to watch. Despite enjoying \"bad\" movies, this one crosses the line into a new dimension of awful. The most disturbing aspect is the apparent significant amount of money put into its production. It is suggested that the director should consume Drain-O due to the travesty created. This movie is so agonizing that it could be used as a form of torture. Overall, films like this should not be created and should be stopped immediately.", "There are moments when finishing a movie leaves one wishing for a refund on the time invested. This experience was undoubtedly one of those times. I came close to giving up, with just 15 minutes left to endure... and I regret not doing so.<br /><br />The rapid transition of a man from a respectable, controlled life to one of utter weakness and recklessness is hard to comprehend.<br /><br />Starting from a graduation party to the expected conclusion, Tristan Price (portrayed by Jesse Metcalfe), a man of privilege and sophistication, allows himself to be swayed by a woman, violence, and intoxicating substances. While the attraction to the captivating April (played by Nathalie Kelley) is understandable, his quick descent into drugs, violence, and unwavering commitment to a stranger is baffling.<br /><br />To be honest, apart from having the opportunity to admire Nathalie Kelley and Monica Keena, this movie lacks any redeeming qualities. Save your money, save your time... do anything else.", "The movie features a weak plot, predictable violence, and characters that are only somewhat interesting. It feels like the writer - who is also one of the stars - was embellishing their own mistakes and inserting wild drug and murder fantasies to make it more exciting. The film's rap and house soundtrack, along with the family conflicts, are poorly acted, stereotypical, and ultimately very dull. Additionally, the title is unoriginal, with IMDb showing five other movies released in 2007-2008 with the same name. I stumbled upon it on Showtime, which mistakenly listed the synopsis for a different film. It wasn't until halfway through that I realized none of the characters were undercover cops, which could have added an intriguing twist despite being a stereotype.", "While some have praised this film for its realistic depiction of drug effects and their impact on individuals, the overall execution falls short. The techniques used are repetitive and fail to engage viewers in a meaningful way. The plot lacks creativity, coherence, and fails to captivate the audience. Despite having some visually appealing actors, the lackluster action sequences do not offer much excitement. \n\nIn contrast to the allure of \"bad\" movies, this film falls flat and offers little substance. For viewers seeking educational films on drug issues, there are far more effective options available such as 'Requiem For A Dream', 'Trainspotting', 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas', and 'Candy'.\n\nAdditionally, the movie lacks originality and even borrows memorable lines from other movies. Ultimately, it is advised to steer clear of this film to save both your money and time.", "According to IMDb, Corey Large is set to appear in a movie called \"Reload\" as a character named Sebastian Cole. The film is in production as of June 2008. The speaker questions how a poor-quality movie like this could deserve a sequel, especially considering that Sebastian supposedly died in a previous movie, \"Loaded.\" They watched \"Loaded\" during early morning insomnia episodes, and though they found it lacking overall, they thought Corey Large's acting was a highlight. They were somewhat surprised by the praise for the female actors, particularly the one playing Brooke, whom they found pretty but not outstanding.", "This film was brimming with potential and an intriguing plot, yet it failed to deliver due to the incompetence of the actors, director, and editors.<br /><br />My heart goes out to the writers, as their work could have shone if given the chance. The performances were lackluster, with only a handful of characters managing to be convincing.<br /><br />The editing appeared to be a showcase of newly learned techniques, resulting in excessive and distracting flashy cuts in nearly every scene. While these cuts were seemingly meant to convey deeper meaning, they fell flat and only served to irk the audience.<br /><br />Hoping for a satisfying conclusion to the turmoil depicted in the film, I was met with disappointment. Instead of closure, I felt as though my time had been squandered and the filmmakers had squandered their resources.", "This film is a poorly executed thriller that borrows elements from various other movies but fails to deliver any coherent storyline or engaging characters. The lackluster acting and nonexistent plot make it difficult to believe that such a film could even get made, let alone released. It is the type of film that makes people turn to illegal downloads out of disappointment. The trailer is misleading, giving the impression of a different movie altogether. Save yourself the time and money by avoiding this painful movie.", "6/10 Acting: Some decent performances, but nothing to write home about. \ud83c\udfad\n\n4/10 Director: Makes some questionable choices that leave you scratching your head. \ud83e\udd14\n\n2/10 Writer: The story is a mess with glaring flaws that make it hard to follow. \ud83d\udcdd\n\n4/10 Overall score: Not a must-watch. \ud83c\udfac\n\nThis movie is a rollercoaster of exaggerated characters and baffling plot twists that make you wonder, \"What were they thinking?\" The overuse of special effects, slow motions, and camera gimmicks can leave you feeling restless after just 30 minutes. The soundtrack tries to carry the story, but it's drowned out by the sheer volume of tracks jammed into this film. With nearly half of the first hour dedicated to music, it's a struggle to find the right balance of dialogue and storytelling. \ud83c\udfb5\ud83d\udcfd\ufe0f", "This is a movie that falls short in terms of entertainment quality. Although there are many worse movies out there. \n\nIn the gangster/drug scene genre, it's challenging to create a believable storyline, and this movie fails in that aspect. For instance, Sebastian's motives seem far-fetched and clich\u00e9. Additionally, the character relationships in the movie are not convincing.\n\nThe plot follows Tristan, who distances himself from his family, but the reasons for this are unclear. The film briefly touches on interesting themes such as the lack of rebellious behavior in upper-class families but fails to explore them in depth.\n\nWhile the movie raises some thought-provoking questions suitable for a socially critical drama, it falls short by focusing more on \"cool\" production techniques and special effects rather than character development and storyline evolution.\n\nIt attempts to convey an anti-substance abuse and violence message but ends up resembling a cheap action movie with average actors. Vinnie Jones manages to salvage some aspects of the film with his performance.\n\nIn conclusion, this movie is not recommendable, earning only 1 star for Vinnie Jones' performance and 2 stars for the editing.", "From the very start of the movie, you can sense the director's unique vision at play. Rather than allowing the story to dictate the style of the film, the director has boldly chosen to shape the narrative around a distinct cinematic approach. However, the execution falls quite short of expectations. It appears that the director aimed to create a stylish film but missed the mark by a wide margin. Despite its shortcomings, I must acknowledge that he does have a good command of the medium. I've certainly seen worse films than this one. To the film's credit, the director manages to maintain a sense of continuity throughout, and the actors deliver commendable performances.", "I briefly perused the movie, scrutinizing it just enough to grasp the essence of its plot. Frankly speaking, I found it rather uninteresting, with certain sequences leaving me perplexed. My sole motivation for watching this film was the captivating presence of CHACE CRAWFORD whom I find undeniably attractive, although I must admit his hairstyle in the movie was peculiar, yet still appealing.<br /><br />\nNevertheless, as appealing as CHACE's allure may be, it fell short in compensating for the film's shortcomings. While the storyline may have merit, what truly detracted from my viewing experience was the incessant profanity littered throughout - a rather unnecessary and off-putting component. Moreover, the ostentatious visual effects and erratic camera movements proved to be a source of discomfort.<br /><br />\nIn conclusion, despite the somewhat tolerable narrative, the film left me rather disenchanted, foundering in overwrought melodrama. Hence, I selectively confined my attention to scenes featuring CHACE. Humorously enough, this movie scarcely merits consideration, unless one harbors an unwavering allegiance to a particular cast member, much like my own fervor for CHACE. Indeed, the cast exuded undeniable allure, with the female contingent radiating a particularly captivating charm. Yet, without doubt, CHACE reigns supreme.", "This whimsical horror film stars Vincent Price as a deranged magician who discovers his magical abilities have been taken by someone else. He plots ways to seek revenge on those who have betrayed him, but his grand plan appears to have unintended consequences.<br /><br />While Price's performance falls slightly short of his best works, he remains the standout reason to tune into this suspenseful movie. The supporting ensemble features Patrick O'Neal, Mary Murphy, Eva Gabor, and Jay Novello.", "I absolutely would have loved this film if I hadn't already read Pat Barker's 'Union Street.' But, that's not the case! Let me tell you - this film is right up my alley, incredibly well-crafted, and trust me, I'm not here to say otherwise. However, as an adaptation, it falls short in every possible way!\n\nThe gut-wrenching novel depicting the harsh reality of life in a working-class area in northern England gripped my heart and didn't let go for weeks! I was taken on a rollercoaster of emotions - tears, repulsion, shock, anger, sympathy, and pure misery, all thanks to the women of Union Street. Wow! This novel had moments where I almost had to look away, but I just couldn't stop reading. Yes, it's bleak, but my goodness, it's enthralling!\n\nNow, about the film - oh my goodness! Hollywood took Barker's raw truth and then sprinkled it with sweet icing sugar. Don't get me wrong, it's a beautiful film with an inspiring soundtrack, stellar performances, a story of hope and romance... absolutely! But is it a true adaptation of 'Union Street'? Definitely not!\n\nThe complex stories of the women from Union Street are distilled into Fonda's character in the movie - sure, they touch upon some tales, but many are just brushed aside. I get it, some themes from Barker's work are too sensitive for a wide audience, and portraying a narrative with seven main characters is a challenge. But here's my gripe - the soul and the gritty essence of the novel are missing! The darkness, rain, broken windows, and the vivid description of poverty are replaced with sunshine, pristine houses, and a cheerful score.\n\nIf you enjoyed the film for its positive outlook and hopeful tone in the face of harsh reality, then let me suggest this - brace yourself before diving into the book. You're in for something more akin to 'Schindler's List'...minus the happy ending!", "I caught a glimpse of the capsule comment raving about \"great acting.\" But let me tell you, these two actors delivered cringeworthy performances with zero chemistry, even under the direction of a usually great filmmaker who is way off his game here. Robert De Niro must be the master of being both brilliant and clueless at the same time. Jane Fonda's portrayal is all over the place, showing that she's lost in a poorly written character. The film's pacing is more agonizing than molasses, making it a real downer to sit through. Despite its aim to be an inspiring tale of overcoming illiteracy, the reality is a massive letdown. I'd rate it a measly 1 out of 10, easily one of the worst films I've seen at this budget level.", "Robert DeNiro plays an incredibly intelligent illiterate in this movie. The film wastes talented actors and is disappointing. The script and dialogue are unbelievable. Jane Fonda's character is a caricature and not amusing. The movie is slow-paced, poorly shot, and too preachy, filled with cliches. Swoozie Kurtz gives a good performance, but it doesn't redeem the film. Additionally, new IMDB rules needing ten lines for reviews are annoying. When a movie is this bad, a longer review isn't necessary. Avoid watching this film as it's a waste of time.", "A man has unnatural feelings for a pig in this absurd comedy with a chaotic opening scene. Unfortunately, the film remains off-putting throughout with unclear storytelling and confusing dialogue. While it boasts good cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond and the briefly seen Sally Kirkland and Frederic Forrest, it may not appeal to all viewers.", "Dear Bait, I express my disdain towards you through the following points: \n\n1. Your attempts at humor fall flat, as your jokes are clich\u00e9d and lack originality, failing to evoke any genuine laughter but rather inducing a sense of nausea. \n\n2. Your dramatic elements come across as contrived and unconvincing, with exaggerated performances and unimpressive villains, reminiscent more of a failed attempt at intimidation by Bill Gates rather than a genuine threat. The portrayal of emotional scenes by Jamie Foxx is so exaggerated that it borders on the ridiculous, invoking further disbelief and discomfort. \n\n3. Your action sequences are lackluster and drawn-out, with shaky camerawork exacerbating the viewer\u2019s discomfort to an extent reminiscent of The Blair Witch Project. The erratic filming style leads to a nauseating experience, further fueling the desire to disengage.\n\n4. Though striving to be a commendable production, your film falls short, resulting in an utter disappointment. The prospect of enduring your mediocrity is so exasperating that I would prefer enduring the harsh conditions of traversing the Sahara with minimal resources and Meryl Streep as my sole companion. Such a predicament sounds more tolerable than subjecting oneself to the absurd narrative and overacted performances of Bait. The nonsensical plot developments, such as miraculous escapes from life-threatening situations, only intensify the frustration, prompting a desire for immediate relief from the cinematic agony. Hence, I implore that such cinematic travesties are best avoided in the future to shield oneself from such distressing experiences.", "The movie's premise has already been discussed, and if you're still here, there's no need for me to play the role of a movie critic. Personally, my view on the film is rather disappointing. While I admire Takashi Miike as a filmmaker, this particular work falls beneath his usual standard, much like DOA 2 and 3, and various others.\n\nSome may overlook the movie's flaws simply because it bears Takashi's name, subscribing to a blind loyalty akin to that of high schoolers. However, for discerning viewers like us, enduring an hour and a half of senseless yelling from a child can be quite grating (and yes, it does detract from the viewing experience), while the film's pacing borders on inducing catatonia, and the acting... well, let's just say it's questionable.\n\nDie-hard Takashi fans may still give it a watch out of curiosity. Yet, it lacks any semblance of originality (think The NeverEnding Story) or meaningful character development besides a surface-level exploration of the lead character in the face of adversity.\n\nAlthough noted as Miike's first co-writing credit, the film fails to showcase much of his distinctive personality. Instead, we get glimpses of his signature visual style through the lens of the director of photography.\n\nThe movie possessed the potential to be remarkable, given its relatively straightforward premise. Regrettably, it appears to have faltered in its execution.\n\nFor those new to Miike's works, I recommend starting with classics like Gozu, Ichi the Killer, and Audition before delving into his deeper catalog, including Blue's Harp, Fudoh, Rainy Dog, and Bird People of China.", "The movie doesn't do justice to its talented cast. The dialogue feels forced, the ghosts lack magic, and some of the performances seem half-hearted. George C. Scott's portrayal of Scrooge lacks conviction, while Edward Woodward's stilt-walking Ghost of Christmas Present is reminiscent of Bernard Cribbins. Only Frank Finlay stands out with his overacting.", "I was thrilled beyond measure to watch this movie after immersing myself in the book just a week before. Anticipation was at its peak as my 13-year-old son and I settled in, ready to experience a beloved holiday tale brought to vivid life on the screen.\n\nHowever, my excitement soon turned to disappointment. The movie strayed far too frequently from the beloved book, leaving me disheartened. While George C. Scott\u2019s talent shone through, his portrayal felt lackluster for the most part, with moments of true immersion few and far between.\n\nAlthough I understand the limitations of filmmaking in '84, particularly in the absence of today's advanced CG effects, the overall quality left much to be desired, especially during the encounter with Jacob Marley.\n\nThe most crushing blow came from the omission of a pivotal moment in the story: the captivating journey where the Spirit of Christmas Present reveals the enduring light and love of the holiday season in the face of despair around the world.\n\nDespite my reservations, I must commend Mr. Scott for his portrayal of the transformed Scrooge at the end, a truly refreshing perspective. Yet, I couldn't help but wish for a grittier representation of Bob Cratchit and a more convincing performance from the depiction of Tiny Tim.\n\nOverall, while this adaptation had its moments, it left me yearning for a more faithful retelling that captured the true essence and emotion of this timeless classic.", "Having previously viewed three other adaptations of the same film, I find this one to be the weakest due to Scott's lackluster and unengaging performance. His portrayal lacks depth, making it hard to connect with the story. Alistair Sim's depiction of the role was far superior. Scott fails to convincingly deliver the dialogue during Scrooge's pivotal moments, resulting in a lack of emotional impact. Comparatively, the actors in the Alistair Sim version outshine those in this adaptation. Even musical renditions and interpretations by the Muppets are more skillfully executed. Overall, this version is disappointing.", "I viewed a film in my English class this afternoon and was rather dismayed by the quality of this particular adaptation. While George C. Scott delivered a commendable performance as Scrooge, the remaining cast members fell short of expectations. The inconsistent acting and the recurrent proclamation of \"Merry Christmas to everyone!\" had me alternating between amusement and near slumber.<br /><br />This film is an interpretation of a short story by Charles Dickens, depicting a wealthy individual who initially dismisses the holiday season as mere nonsense. Following encounters with three enlightening spirits, the protagonist experiences a transformation in his perspective on Christmas.<br /><br />I am perplexed as to how a production with such a hastily constructed screenplay garnered positive reviews. Instead of endorsing this lackluster film, I wholeheartedly recommend the comedic rendition of the tale, \"Scrooged,\" featuring Bill Murray. It, at the very least, managed to elicit laughter.", "When will this pain end? I never want to watch another remake of A Christmas Carol. They just keep churning out movies with the same story, all competing to be the best, but they always fall short. It's such a tired old tale, full of morals and outdated, happy-go-lucky thinking. Like anyone actually learns anything from it! The fact that they keep making different versions shows that we never really do.", "It was 9:30 PM last night at my friend's camping trailer and we were excited to catch a new episode of South Park. That being said, South Park airs at 10:30 PM in my country, so to pass the time, we tuned into another show, Father of the Pride. I must confess, I've only seen a couple of episodes of Father of the Pride. Initially, I found it lacking in humor and unnecessarily crude, prompting me to consider the importance of getting enough rest for an early morning football game. Nevertheless, I decided to give Father of the Pride another chance recently and noticed striking similarities to The Simpsons, except with lions in place of the iconic yellow human characters.<br /><br />Curiously, I question the show's TV-14 rating as I find The Simpsons to be more overtly vulgar, with Father of the Pride only featuring a few unimpressive homosexual jokes. The Simpsons also delves into darker themes and crude content, especially in their Halloween specials. Despite learning that the creator of Father of the Pride also directed Shrek 2, I believe the film outshines the show, perhaps due to the creator's focus on family-friendly content. Admittedly, Father of the Pride did manage to bring a smile to my face, even leading to a moment of genuine laughter on a few occasions.<br /><br />All things considered, I view Father of the Pride with indifference. It doesn't incite hatred, yet it fails to capture my interest as compellingly as The Simpsons has in the past.<br /><br />Rating: 3.5/10", "This is an exciting futuristic twist on Jules Verne's \"Mysterious Island\"! The sound editing may not be up to par, but it adds to the charm \u2013 hearing the on-set dialogue and recorded voices simultaneously gives it a raw, authentic feel. Shot with a group of lively Boston actors in scenic New Hampshire, this amateur film has a captivating energy that will leave New England viewers spellbound! With the director's voice guiding the actors and unique characters like a mind-talking guy and a deep-voiced blue alien, there's never a dull moment. Despite its flaws, the imaginative special effects and dynamic music create an unforgettable experience. Even with its jerky animation reminiscent of Karl Zeman's style, this film showcases Brett Piper's early talent and creativity. In the end, \"Mysterious Planet\" puts other classics like EQUINOX or PLANET OF THE DINOSAURS to shame, making it a must-see for budding filmmakers! And can you believe it was made on a shoestring budget? A true inspiration for anyone passionate about cinema!", "\"Let me share with you a hidden gem - Mysterious Planet, a hilariously bad movie that somehow manages to find a special place in my heart. From its comically poor special effects to the laughably awful soundtrack in the first 15 minutes, it's a ride you won't soon forget.<br /><br />Picture this: a space scene so nonsensical that you'll be questioning your sanity, with washing-up liquid bottles flying by as dialogue gets lost in a sea of confusion.

The outcome is nothing short of mundane.", "In this TV movie, William Russ is the protagonist who reappears to settle his debts and faces persuasion from the versatile Peter Falk (Colombo) to return home. Despite engaging performances from the former star Peter Falk, the plot is mediocre with predictable storytelling. The movie falls short with an underwhelming performance from William Russ, resulting in a lackluster viewing experience that earns it a \"D\" grade.", "\"Finding John Christmas\" is a poorly executed film with a confusing plot, bad dialogue, and lackluster acting from Valerie Bertinelli and co-stars.

Merry Christmas!", "I never really like to talk about good movies, but when it comes to a bad one, I have to be straight up about it. Let's chat about Vivah - this guy, Sooraj Badjatya, seems to have totally missed the mark after the success of Hum Aapke Hain Kaun. He thought he could strike gold with this cheesy wedding flick. Vivah is dripping with cheese to the point that the Badjatyas have out-cheesed the Johars and Chopras by a mile.<br /><br />Not one moment during the movie made me go 'Wow, this is good!'.

So, be prepared for that!", "I wouldn't necessarily call this movie terrible, but it definitely didn't impress me. I was hoping for something better, especially after watching \"Hum Aapke Hain Kaun.\" This film felt completely outdated. I kept waiting for some surprising twists, but all I got was the girl getting burned and earning her aunt's affection.\n\nDespite being engaged, the characters needed approval for every little thing, and they were painfully shy despite numerous interactions. I thought the aunt would be more wicked, but she just complained incessantly.\n\nSure, we all have our moments with the kids, but we don't constantly shed tears. This movie painted an idealistic picture of a happy family, with one villainous woman, supportive in-laws, and a man deeply in love with his wife. It was interesting how the roles reversed for Anupam Kher from \"HAHK,\" now playing the poor bride's father. I had a feeling Mohnish Behl would make an appearance as well. All in all, I feel like I wasted my time watching this. I'd rate it a 2 out of 10.", "An adult version of Cinderella immersed in a dreamy, unrealistically romantic tale, with Shahid Kapoor shining as the star. If you seek dreamlike love stories, this is your pick, but for realistic folks, it might not be worth your three hours. Wake up and skip this film! Four out of five viewers with me didn't enjoy it, mainly due to its overly unrealistic scenes. Can it really surpass a classic like Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam?", "After being absolutely dazzled by Mr. Brosnan's charismatic turn as a scoundrel in \"The Tailor of Panama\" (a perfect 10/10 in every category: casting, acting, script, story, editing, pace, music, emotional depth, and more), I eagerly awaited his newest film. However, my excitement quickly transformed to disappointment. This movie felt more like a dry script reading than a full-blown cinematic experience, choosing vulgarity over substance at every turn. It pales in comparison to the richness and satisfaction found in \"The Tailor of Panama.\" The blame lies squarely on the shoulders of the screenwriter and director. Despite sitting in anticipation for that anticipated standout moment, it never materialized. No laughter, no tears, just one fleeting smile from a snippet of dialogue. Was it worth the $7 ticket price? Not in the slightest.", "I was on the verge of leaving, but I had already paid for the movie ticket, and my equally disappointed friend insisted on staying. After the charming innocence of \"A New Hope\" and the captivating sophistication of \"The Empire Strikes Back,\" I eagerly anticipated the release of \"Return of the Jedi.\" However, right from the first scene of this excessively commercialized film, I felt a deep sense of disappointment and fury towards Lucas. The sheer commercialism of the movie was profoundly disheartening, and it was evident that Lucas lacked even a trace of shame in his quest for profit. The introduction of Episode I only reinforced this viewpoint - I rest my case, Your Honor, on the egregiousness of Jarjar Binks (though I must request that the jury members be provided with barf bags beforehand).\n\nFrom the moment the gate opened at Jabba's lair, it became clear that the \"film\" was primarily a lengthy advertisement for a plethora of marketable action figures that Lucas shamelessly injected throughout the movie - from the grotesque guards and peculiar flunky to Jabba's repulsive muppet-pet and the extensive array of characters, both new and recycled, including the detestably adorable Ewoks and the rebel alliance aliens, each given mere seconds of screen time to entice young viewers. The blatant exploitation of children's consumerist tendencies was nauseatingly evident.\n\nFurthermore, Lucas failed to offer a fresh storyline, instead regurgitating the Death Star from \"A New Hope\" and inundating the movie with saccharine sentimentality. This move felt like a blatant betrayal of the loyal fan base, as though Lucas took pleasure in subjecting them to such substandard material, manipulating their loyalty for his financial gain. The underlying message seemed to be, \"I can produce the most repulsive garbage imaginable, and my fans will still line up in droves to watch it, buying every trinket associated with the film, thereby enriching me further.\"\n\nAlthough there may have been a few fleeting moments where Harrison Ford's performance shone through the mire, any redeeming aspects were overshadowed by the overwhelming sense of overt commercialism that Lucas crassly prioritized in this ultimate capitulation to profit over artistic integrity.", "This story follows the unfortunate fate of a secretary caught in a love affair with a married man, leading to a tragic ending. However, the narrative leaves us with more questions than answers, as only one side of the story is presented. The portrayal of the characters may resonate with those familiar with the complexities of romance and betrayal. The tension between moral dilemmas and personal desires adds depth to the tale. Joining the characters on their journey will definitely make you ponder the complexities of relationships, loyalty, and consequences. So grab your popcorn, get cozy, and prepare to be taken on a rollercoaster of emotions!", "This film will keep you on the edge of your seat with its unexpected twists and turns! A wild ride from start to finish, filled with shocking betrayals and surprising revelations. Don't miss out on this rollercoaster of emotions and drama!", "This film is a blatant attempt to capitalize on the popularity of Sex in the City and Four Weddings and a Funeral. Renaming it \"Sex at a Funeral\" might have given it a better chance at the box office.<br /><br />However, the film struggles to find its identity. The characters deliver ridiculously clever lines but lack any semblance of humanity. A series of nonsensical actions drive the barely-there plot, leaving viewers disillusioned with the entire endeavor.<br /><br />And while Andie MacDowell gives a commendable performance, the standout is Imelda Staunton, who plays an unexpected role as a police detective (no height requirements, apparently). Staunton's flawless portrayal contrasts with the shortcomings of the writer-director.<br /><br />If you found Notting Hill insincere, steer clear of this one. It's a phony baloney experience you'll want to avoid.", "This film is criticized for being one of the worst ever. Kate's introduction scene with Jed and a group of guys clapping is described as overly Hollywood. Another negative aspect mentioned is when Kate was shown running her hands over the pavement, giving the impression that she was examining its texture. The acting of Andie was heavily criticized, making it difficult for viewers to connect with the characters and feel their love for each other. The other two women in the film were praised for their performances, overshadowing Andie. Overall, the movie is regarded as overly campy, with many unrealistic situations. Andie's acting was deemed unhelpful to the film. Additionally, a comment was made about Andie's appearance stating that she appears to show a lot of gums and suggesting that her glamorous look in commercials might be achieved with heavy makeup.", "The text portrays a negative beginning, with three women acting immaturely while sharing gin, cigarettes, and a caramel chocolate treat for the best 'man' story. It worsens as Andie's character, a headmistress of an English school, falls for her former 14-year-old student who is now an organ player but faces destruction due to her vengeful 'girlfriend'. The storyline descends into clich\u00e9d melodrama as Andie's character forgives her 'friend', has the organ player's child, and the three women continue their gin-drinking and cigarette-smoking routine. The narrative concludes with Andie's character discarding the caramel chocolates on the street in a feeble attempt to suggest personal growth.", "Delve into the captivating drama of conflicting friendships and humorous mishaps in a film that teeters between hilarity and heartache.

Amazed by the positive reviews, I can't be the only one who found the characters far from genuine. Kate is expected to be a respectable community figure but is willing to risk her job for a relationship with Jed. Their sudden \"love\" and her extreme grief over his death, yet she skips his funeral and withholds crucial information from his family. How did an American become headmistress of a traditional British school? Janine's abuse of power should have resulted in severe consequences, not a romantic entanglement with a suspect! And Molly's actions are best left unspoken. Janine and Molly's misplaced guilt over Jed is misplaced, considering the circumstances of his demise. What about Gerald, the innocent bystander who suffers as a result? If only I could express my disapproval to the makers of this film.", "This movie is not set in New York, but in the British countryside. It may start as a comedy but quickly turns into a dramatic and \"abracadabrantesque\" tale, resembling a French presidential mandate. Despite the confusing plot, the standout performances of the actresses, especially McDowell, captivate with their delicate and nuanced portrayal of characters. The movie offers a feminine perspective, showcasing diverse ways of living and a multitude of viewpoints. While enjoyable, the abrupt ending may leave viewers craving more.", "Was this movie supposed to be a comedy or a serious drama? It starts with light banter between three women, then transitions into conflict when one meets a man. As the plot darkens, the tone changes, making it hard to connect with the original feel. The attempt to return to light banter at the end feels forced and the conclusion lacks believability. This British film failed at the box office and was not well-known, even years after its release.", "Andie McDowell captivates as the 40-something woman embarking on a late but passionate romance with a much younger man, causing rifts with her two closest friends.<br /><br />Perceiving the young man as a gigolo or gold-digger, the friends take extreme measures to end the relationship, blinded by their own opinions and fears.<br /><br />The series of outlandish events push the boundaries of believability, shattering any hopes of a genuine love story. Instead of a heartfelt tale, viewers are left bewildered and disappointed, shaking their heads at the incredulity of it all. Proceed with caution and lower your expectations before watching this film \u2014 it falls woefully short of a satisfying experience, meriting a meager rating of 4 out of 10. Don't waste your time on this one; there are far superior options available.", "SPOILER ALERT: In a surprising turn of events, the character Jed is mistakenly accused of infidelity and abruptly expelled by Kate, a spinster played by Andie McDowell. Thinking she has caught Jed in a compromising situation, Kate dramatically kicks him out, throwing his shoes after him. Jed, despite his reluctance, leaves and decides to sit in the middle of the road to put his shoes back on, only to tragically meet his end when he is struck by a truck, a significant moment symbolized by the film's title, \"Crushed.\"\n\nIt is hard to believe that a screenwriter would include such a dramatic plot twist in a supposedly light-hearted comedy. Until this point, the movie attempts to be whimsical but falls short, lacking the genuine charm to captivate the audience. Sadly, Jed is the only character with any redeeming qualities, as the rest of the cast comes across as annoying. However, there is a shift towards the end as the female characters find solace in friendship and support, leaving behind their destructive tendencies. This unexpected turn of events earns the film a disappointing rating of 2 out of 5.", "The main flaw of Crush is not its poor acting, lack of plot, or subpar camerawork. Rather, its few outstanding moments lead you to anticipate more. However, these moments are overshadowed by the film's shortcomings. If you enjoy violin music and melodramatic scenes featuring women over 40, you may appreciate it. Personally, I found these elements off-putting and had a negative experience. Overall rating: 4/10.", "Not a 'chick flick', but a film for everyone. This is one of the worst movies ever made by a male director about women. Director Andy McKay clearly lacks understanding of women. It is filled with bad taste, reminiscent of American Pie's humor, a crude and senseless storyline, unrealistic characters, and tasteless fantasies brought to life on screen. Insulting and far from funny. It's perplexing how three talented actresses agreed to be a part of this project.", "As a single woman over 40, I found this film to be demeaning and insulting towards women in general, regardless of age. It was a poor attempt at a \"chick flick\" by a male writer and director, which ultimately failed. The lack of plot and character development, along with the unrealistic scenarios, made it impossible to connect with any of the characters. Additionally, the forced male fantasy of a woman exploring lesbianism was disappointing. Overall, I regret wasting 112 minutes of my life on this film and wish I could get a refund on the DVD rental.", "I received this movie as a gift because of its promising storyline about the friendship between three women, which is disrupted when one of them falls in love with a younger man. However, I found the execution rather disappointing. The characters are portrayed in exaggerated ways, lacking mutual support and instead engaging in schemes to undermine one another.\n\nDespite admiring Anna Chancellor and Imelda Staunton in the past, I was let down by the poor script that forced them to navigate a blend of slapstick and screwball comedy, which felt out of place for professional women in a small town. The portrayal of these intelligent women constantly lamenting about their romantic lives seemed clich\u00e9 and unoriginal.\n\nThe potential of the storyline, particularly the lesbian sub-plot, was not fully explored, and the depiction of the women as heavy smokers and drinkers felt unrealistic, especially during the baby scene. Overall, I believe this film could have been much better with a stronger script and more tension. Sadly, it fell short of expectations. I would rate it a 4 out of 10.", "\"The Crush\" is an absolutely delightful and charming romantic comedy that captures the essence of friendship and love! It cleverly weaves together the perfect blend of romance and comedy, reminiscent of the iconic \"Sex and the City.\" <br /><br />I was particularly captivated by the brilliant portrayal of the young hunk, played by the talented Kenny Doughty, whose character adds a refreshing twist to the storyline. And let's not forget the fantastic performance by Andie MacDowell, who shines as an ex-pat amidst a stellar cast of familiar faces from British dramas and comedies. <br /><br />While the plot takes some unexpected turns towards the end, it keeps you on the edge of your seat with its dramatic flair. And as the credits rolled, I couldn't help but appreciate the unique perspective of writer/director Scot John McKay. His fresh take on relationships and identity adds a layer of depth that sets \"The Crush\" apart from the rest. <br /><br />Overall, this film is a must-watch for anyone looking for a heartwarming and entertaining cinematic experience. Don't miss out on the magic of \"The Crush\"! \ud83c\udfac\ud83d\udc96", "The movie could potentially have been improved by delving deeper into a more thought-provoking theme rather than simply skimming the surface of a lesbian relationship. It follows a predictable trajectory, with the two lead actresses bearing a striking resemblance to the Russian music duo t.A.T.u, which may not be entirely coincidental. Lacking originality, the film seems to rely on the fame of others to bolster its appeal. The various supporting actors, many of whom are notable figures in Romania, do not seem to have well-defined roles, with some not even being professional actors. In essence, the formula seems to be \"inspired\" by t.A.T.u, coupled with fame-seeking actors and a lackluster plot, sprinkled with profanity for shock value\u2014resulting in a disappointing end product. Despite the potentially good premise, the movie falls short, leaving much to be desired.", "The movie has a good storyline, but the main cast's acting falls short. Maria's performance feels dry and lacks emotion, while Ioana appears tense and unnatural. Tudor is the only standout with his acting. Despite some good elements, like the story and a few performances, the movie overall disappoints. The incestuous relationship in the film seems more believable than the underdeveloped lesbian relationship between Maria and Ioana.", "This movie heavily relies on the controversial themes of incest and lesbianism for attention, but unfortunately falls short in creating a compelling storyline. The dialogue is weak, the sensuality in the \"sex scenes\" is lacking, and the overall acting and dialogue feel more suitable for high-school audiences rather than adults. The excessive use of inner monologues further cheapens its quality. It ultimately comes across as a gutless and shallow film that misses the mark on delivering a gripping narrative and engaging drama. It could have greatly benefited from a stronger plot and more depth. Additionally, while the resources may be limited, that should not be an excuse for the film's lackluster performance. The use of musicians rather than trained actors, such as Tudor Chirila, also hinders the movie's credibility. Overall, it's a disappointing viewing experience for both Romanian cinema and mature audiences alike.", "The film \"Love Sick\" portrays the intense and complicated sexual relationships of Alex, Kiki, and Sandu resulting in a sad ending. Director Tudor Giurgiu aimed to depict the complexity of Romanian sexual life. The movie lacked a clear explanation of how the relationships developed and did not include a scene of Alex and Kiki's sexual intercourse. However, some scenes, such as the ear-piercing moment and their conversation on the soccer field, were touching and recommended.", "I am not as similar to Love Sick as I initially thought. The film delves into the complex sexual relationships among Alex, Kiki, and Sandu, embodying intense emotions of frustration and jealousy. Ultimately, Alex awakens to the realization that their love triangle has no future, culminating in a sorrowful ending.\n\nDirector Tudor Giurgiu joined us at the AMC theatre on Sunday at 12:00 PM on 08/10/06 to watch the movie together. Post-viewing, he shared his intention behind creating the film, aiming to portray the intricate nature of Romanian sexual relationships.\n\nIn my view, sexual relations are inherently intricate universally, and I did not find the movie particularly impactful. The romantic entanglements of Alex and Kiki, as well as Kiki and her brother Sandu, resembled a commonplace neighborhood tale.\n\nThere are two main reasons I did not enjoy this movie. Firstly, it failed to illustrate how the characters' love connections unfolded. It seemed abrupt, with the implication that Alex fell for Kiki simply by living in the same building. Secondly, the absence of a depiction of Alex and Kiki's intimate relationship left me wanting more. Despite this, there were still aspects worth recommending, such as the poignant \"ear piercing\" scene where Alex endures pain to show his love for Kiki. Additionally, the scene where they lie in the soccer field and converse authentically about their love was moving and heartfelt.", "This movie, despite its significant and well-executed launch, fell short of expectations. The opening scene, featuring two brothers in an intimate embrace, sets a questionable tone that continues on a downward spiral. The plot lacks any standout moments to capture attention, overshadowed by lackluster performances and a superficial exploration of promising themes like incest and lesbianism. While the filmmakers may claim subtlety, the end result feels disappointingly shallow. Viewers seeking highlights will be left wanting, ultimately disillusioned by the missed opportunities in a film that fails to deliver. Save yourself the time and skip this one, as there are much more fulfilling ways to spend an evening.", "It's possible that the movie had potential to be good, featuring a complex love story. However, it was poorly executed. The visuals are inconsistent and the overall presentation feels cluttered and restricted. The audio quality needs improvement, as is common in Romanian films, and the lighting and color choices are questionable at times. The soundtrack is lackluster and doesn't enhance the storyline. The acting is underwhelming, with only the landlady delivering a convincing performance. Overall, the acting lacks maturity and fails to engage the audience. The film comes across as naive, told from a childish perspective. It's recommended to only watch out of extreme curiosity.", "Closer to authenticity and delving deeper than \"Breakdance\", Stan Lathan's \"Beat Street\" exudes a subtle charm. Although seizing the wave of the 'breakin' craze, this film manages to offer some entertainment by delving into the lives of three young comrades and a spirited kid in Queens, New York. Each showcases a distinctive flair - one is a hustler, another a d.j., while the third is an artist known for crafting 'burners', and Lee, the youngest, shines as a dynamic 'hip-hop' dancer.\n\nLathan struggles to capture genuine interest in the narrative, with the young ensemble also grappling to embody their roles. Consequently, the film heavily relies on its infectious music and dynamic dancing to carry the weight.\n\nDespite the sharp choreography that electrifies both nightclub and street scenes, it fails to catapult \"Beat Street\" to greater eminence. Regrettably, the movie loses its momentum towards the end, just as a glimmer of promise emerges that it could blossom into something intriguing.\n\nSunday, August 25, 1996 - Video", "This movie is about a group of high school students who are into hip-hop, breakdancing, graffiti, and aspiring to become a DJ. However, the film is not well-received. Many find the acting terrible and the drama lacking. The characters are supposed to be charming, but they come across as dull. One character in particular, Ramon, who does graffiti on subway trains, is criticized for defacing public property. The movie portrays these law-breaking activities as enjoyable, which some viewers find questionable. While there are some noteworthy musical performances in the film, the constant hip-hop music can be overwhelming. The movie's focus on music leaves much to be desired in terms of storytelling. Despite a few entertaining scenes, the movie's emphasis on hip-hop may not appeal to everyone. Additionally, the film contains a surprising amount of profanity for a PG-rated movie.", "Wow! Wild Style and Style Wars are truly original Hip Hop masterpieces that capture the essence of the culture with authenticity and grittiness. While Beat Street features some early Hip Hop artists, it falls short in comparison to the raw energy and spirit found in the first two movies. The music and dancing in Beat Street may be enjoyable, but its overproduced Hollywood style misses the mark for true enthusiasts. Personally, I find the beats lacking and prefer the genuine vibe of Wild Style. Regardless of differing tastes, it's clear that this movie doesn't quite hit the mark for me, earning only a 4 out of ten rating. But hey, the dancing is still pretty awesome!", "I experienced a sense of disappointment while viewing \"Happy Days\" upon the introduction of the character Chachi, which led me to anticipate similar sentiments during a recent film viewing. Despite a notable cameo by Scott Baio in a thrilling skateboard chase scene, the overall impression was lackluster. Jodie Foster, in her inaugural mature role, delivered a commendable performance, yet failed to elevate the film from its uninteresting narrative. Regrettably, this cinematic venture consumed two hours of my time with no redeeming qualities. The lack of compelling characters, implausible plotline, subpar editing, and dismal cinematography further belied any semblance of engagement. Set in 1970s California, the film portrays disillusioned teenagers navigating inept parental figures, resulting in a depiction void of depth or intrigue. I advise against investing time in this lackluster production that fails to meet even the most basic standards of quality filmmaking.", "Awful film featuring scattered elements of the Ramones. Follows the typical 1970's/80's comedy format where the cool kids take charge of the school with a whimsical plan. The movie's plot revolves around a Ramones-loving girl and a school rebelling against their oppressive administration. Skip this film and opt for something like Wild Zero starring Guitar Wolf for an entertaining B movie experience. Poor acting, writing, and plot with the Ramones seemingly involved for a quick cash grab. This film is simply terrible.", "This movie feels like a 90-minute Ramones concert sprinkled with random silliness and moments that drag on forever. Seriously, what kind of high school is this supposed to be?<br /><br />Unless you're a die-hard Ramones fan, please, I beg you, don't waste your time like I did. It was painful to watch from beginning to end. They should rename it Ramone Fever because that's all you'll see. Everyone seems to love them in this film, but there's no real storyline to follow. As far as teen comedies go, this one is rock bottom.", "I rated this film 2 stars solely due to Dominic Monaghan's commendable acting performance. However, the overall quality of the film is notably subpar. The direction of the movie was executed poorly, indicating the need for the director to reconsider her career path and possibly gain inspiration from watching other films. Despite Monaghan's skill as an actor, his talents were not showcased effectively in this low-quality production. The portrayal of Jack's best friend by an unknown actor was unconvincing and should have been avoided altogether. I had low expectations for a small-scale film like this, but it would benefit from more depth and effort in developing the characters and their environment. I strongly advise against investing your time or money in this disappointing film.", "I eagerly anticipated watching this movie without any cuts or interruptions, given the positive reviews. However, just as it started to build suspense, it shied away and shifted focus. The eerie elements such as dripping water, black rain, prophetic dreams, and getting lost in raw sewage were introduced but not fully explored to create a chilling atmosphere.\n\nDisappointingly, Chamberlain's expressionless performance left me feeling bewildered as the film progressed. The potential of incorporating Aboriginal chants and instruments in the background was lost in a chaotic mix that did little to evoke fear. The themes of ancient gods inhabiting modern individuals and the belief that red-haired white men were the first priests were presented superficially rather than delving into their deeper meaning regarding the Dream Time.\n\nIn the climactic scene, the intended message was unclear. The significance of a massive wave causing devastation resembling an apocalypse seemed exaggerated given the lack of establishing the world's dire state. The final wave's impact on Burton felt disconnected and failed to resonate as a significant event.\n\nThe most chilling moment occurred in Charlie's apartment when Burton confronts an old man for scaring his wife, with the repeated question \"Who are you?\" creating a truly unsettling atmosphere. Unfortunately, this level of unease was not maintained throughout the film, missing the opportunity to fully showcase Weir's potential.", "In this episode, a woman murders her husband with a poker, but her plan is interrupted by a crazy man dressed as Santa Claus. She tries to hide the body and frames the Santa killer for the murder. The episode is repetitive and lacks originality, focusing on the woman's efforts to avoid getting caught with a dead body while staying safe from the maniac. It doesn't stand out as a memorable episode of Tales from the Crypt.", "The noise you're hearing isn't bees, it's the aftermath of enduring an incredibly lengthy, tediously dull movie that's poorly acted. I have no idea how I managed to stay awake for the full 3 1/2 hours. The storyline is quite straightforward - three highly unappealing characters conversing about sex over the course of 3 1/2 hours. You might have thought Rohmer's films were boring, but this one is on a whole other level. Watching this whole movie without switching it off or resorting to violence must mean I have a high tolerance for suffering.", "Iberia is absolutely delightful to watch on TV, but have you ever thought about experiencing it on the silver screen? This movie is a captivating blend of dance and music that will surely leave you in awe. Whether you have a soft spot for classical music or a love for modern dance, this could very well be your next favorite date night movie! And let's not forget about the mesmerizing skillful dancing that Bollywood movies are known for. If you appreciate skillful dancing incorporated into a lengthy movie, Bollywood is the way to go! Director Carlos Saura's expertise in capturing dance sequences shines throughout the film, making it a visually stunning experience. While the movie may be a bit lengthy at one and a half hours, the beauty and artistry displayed are well worth your time. Remember, not all art needs to be larger than life, and this film beautifully showcases the art of dance and music in its own unique way.", "I'm surprised that critics enjoyed this movie because, honestly, it's a mess. The plot is confusing, the characters are flat, and Michael Bowen's character is just a nosy, judgmental mess. There's nothing compelling or interesting about any of it. It's not edgy, imaginative, or clever. In fact, it's downright tedious. It's no wonder this movie didn't make it to theaters, and the fact that it's being aired on \"This Network\" is just sad. I suggest ditching this trainwreck and tuning into a rerun of the Garden Smart show on PBS for a much better time. If you stumble upon this disaster late at night, go for a walk instead. Even if it's in smog, you'll thank yourself for avoiding this mess. Life is short, but this movie sure isn't.", "This movie is absolutely awful - the script is terrible, the direction is bad, and the ending is nonsensical. The performances, with the exception of Clancy Brown and Michael Pollard, are also subpar. Watching this movie feels like purgatory - enduring it helps balance out the bad movie karma so you can enjoy a good one later on.<br /><br />The film revolves around a father and son who don't look like they could possibly be related. The male lead's character is poorly written and lacks charisma. The plot points are predictable, and the actions of the female lead and her brother, the cop, are illogical. Moreover, a significant action by the female lead at the end of the movie is inconsistent with the script.", "Burt Kennedy's prior brilliance as a director is nowhere to be seen in this sluggish production. The film appears not only low-budget, but also recycles battle scenes from the vastly superior \"The Last Command\" from 1955, making it seem outdated in comparison. The original action sequences lack direction and coherence, mirroring the overall substandard quality of the entire film. The project exudes the amateurish feel of a poorly-made student film, suggesting a limited budget. The pacing is as slow as molasses, with an inconsistent cast delivering performances that swing between exaggerated and lifeless. Despite a commendable effort by Raul Julia, the ensemble's overall display falls short. Historical inaccuracies further detract from the experience. In addition, the lengthy three-hour runtime exacerbates the tedium, contrasting with the concise approach more suitable for uninteresting content. For a worthwhile viewing experience on the topic of the Alamo, consider the 1960 adaptation by John Wayne or revisit the original 1955 film. It's baffling that six producers were involved in creating such a disappointing film. A definite pass.", "This film is acclaimed as a top-tier James Arness western but is notorious for being the worst Alamo movie ever created. The storyline was abysmal, filled with inaccuracies and blatant distortions. The lack of continuity was glaring, exemplified by the nonsensical cannon sequence where cannons with mud and ramrods protruding from them were fired by the Mexicans. The absurdity was further compounded by Brian Keith's preposterous hat choice, indicating a lapse in costuming judgment.", "This movie has a lot of problems. It focuses more on the myths about the Alamo than the actual history. The quality of the production is poor, making it seem like a project for actors who may not have had better opportunities. The biggest issue for me is that the actors chosen to play the real people from the Alamo don't seem believable at all.<br /><br />As someone from Texas, I grew up hearing the myths about the Alamo. Later on, I learned more about the true history. I can appreciate a good movie from either perspective, but this movie didn't give me a chance to enjoy it. Even older versions by John Wayne or Fess Parker had more life and were somewhat more accurate.<br /><br />This movie was very disappointing. I recommend avoiding it.", "This account offers a nuanced portrayal of the renowned and valiant siege of the Alamo during the Texan struggle for independence from Mexico. Notwithstanding certain inaccuracies, the depiction remains intriguing. The cast includes notable actors such as James Arness portraying Jim Bowie, Brian Keith as Davy Crockett, Alec Baldwin as Colonel Travis, and Raul Julia as General Santa Anna. Additionally, this made-for-TV endeavor features the talents of David Ogden Stiers, Kathleen York, and Jim Metzler. The original music composed by Peter Bernstein further enhances the production's quality.", "The film \"The Alamo: Thirteen Days to Glory\" is terrible. The acting is bad, it is overly patriotic, and lacks historical accuracy. There are a few decent moments but not enough to maintain interest due to its excessive length. Rating: 1 out of 10.", "Norman Maclean's story is a masterpiece, yet Redford's adaptation falls short as it includes mundane scenes of the Maclean brothers engaging in activities not present in the original narrative. Brad Pitt's portrayal of the character Paul Maclean is either comical or disheartening, depending on one's interpretation of the original story. Despite this, some scenes featuring fly casting are visually stunning. Tom Skerritt as the father and Craig Sheffer as Norman deliver strong performances, embodying a traditional sense of masculinity. The female characters in the film lack depth, which is unfortunate given Maclean's affection for women in his narrative.", "The scenic beauty in this film captivates the eyes, but sadly, that's where the excitement ends. Enduring a lengthy and monotonous narrative, one can't help but wish for a more thrilling storyline. The minister's failure to address his son's deviance from his teachings is a glaring misstep, making one question the characters' authenticity. The constant blasphemy from the minister's boys feels out of place, especially given their Presbyterian background. The protagonist, Paul, comes across as immature and self-centered, evoking more eye-rolls than empathy. Amidst the mundane backdrop, the tension between Paul and his Native American love interest hints at a more compelling narrative that remains unexplored. Ultimately, the film feels stagnant, with the minister's sons leading uninspiring lives in a sleepy town. Rather than endure this lackluster tale, one might find more enjoyment in a fishing show.", "This passage talks about the flaws in the movie \"A River Runs Through It,\" criticizing the lack of a compelling story despite its visually appealing aspects. The portrayal of the narrator/author as a character trapped in a narrow-minded, passive existence is highlighted, as he fails to understand his brother's motivations and lacks any sense of humor or joy in life. The movie is deemed predictable and not worth watching, ultimately receiving a low rating of 3 out of 10.", "This film lacked a compelling plot, making its lengthy duration feel unbearable. Despite only being 123 minutes long, it felt like enduring four hours of monotony. Not only was there a noticeable absence of conflict, but the overall narrative was uneventful. While I wouldn't label it as the worst movie I've seen, that title now belongs to \"The Fast And The Furious.\" This critique isn't from a viewer seeking only action-packed films, as I generally dislike modern action movies. This film falls far on the opposite end of the spectrum with its lack of substantial development. Despite its shortcomings, the scenery and costumes were commendable.", "While the movie showcases stunning scenery, it lacks a cohesive plot due to the absence of conflict. Despite its attempt to be artistic, the film fails to deliver a compelling storyline, prioritizing aesthetics over storytelling fundamentals. If you appreciate Montana scenery and fly fishing, you may enjoy this film for its visuals, but be prepared for the absence of a coherent narrative.", "This movie features stunning scenery but lacks a coherent plot. A plot requires conflict, which this movie fails to deliver. It spends two hours showcasing beautiful scenes without engaging in any meaningful activity. While the film attempts to be artistic, it overlooks the essential elements of storytelling. If you appreciate Montana scenery and fly fishing, you may enjoy certain aspects of this film. However, it lacks a cohesive narrative, so don't expect a compelling story.", "I'm sorry, I rated it a 1, which is reserved for movies that I either walk out on or fall asleep during. In this instance, I fell asleep 10 minutes before the movie ended because I was really bored and had no interest in finding out what happened next.", "Mann captures the Alberta Rocky Mountains exquisitely, while Stewart and Brennan deliver engaging performances. However, Hollywood's portrayal of a Mountie in Dawson City, Yukon dictating law enforcement and gunfights for control is far from reality. Canadian viewers may find the exaggerated plot either entertaining or disappointing.", "This is an action-packed Western movie set in the scenic Northwest and features James Stewart leading a talented cast. The movie showcases stunning scenery, great costumes, and plenty of action and adventure. Stewart plays a wealthy cattleman who faces off against a corrupt government in the old Northwest.\n\nThe main downside of the film is the portrayal of a stereotypical cynical character as the hero, a common trope in Hollywood. Despite this, Stewart's character is kind to his two partners, which adds depth to his credibility and likeability.\n\nHowever, his rude behavior towards others makes it hard to root for him or connect with his character fully. He resembles the one-dimensional characters seen in spaghetti Westerns, though not quite as extreme.\n\nNevertheless, the minor characters, including Walter Brennan, Royal Dano, Harry Morgan, and others, add enjoyment to the movie and make it worth watching.", "This sequel is an absolute disaster in the realm of movies. Once again, it fails to make any sense. The killer is back, gleefully taking lives for sport. However, this time around, the victims are the ones creating a film about the events of the original movie. This results in what can only be described as the most ludicrous film ever.\n\nAvoid watching this at all costs. If you value your time, stay far away from it. You'll find yourself questioning the director and anyone around you as to why this film was even made. It completely misses the mark by failing to blend the elements of horror, action, and crime that made the original a success.\n\nKeep this away from your children. Regardless of whether they are teens, young kids, or young adults, this movie will have an undesirable impact on them.", "Oh, the local Mexican television channel 5 presents a late-night lineup of horror movies every day at 2:00 a.m., drawing viewers with a collection of classic fright-fests ranging from the 1970s to the early 2000s. Yesterday's feature presentation was \"Return to Cabin By The Lake,\" a movie that left a lasting impression, though perhaps not for all the right reasons.\n\nThe original \"Cabin By The Lake\" was a notable cult favorite characterized by its low-budget charm and relative success among audiences. Unfortunately, its sequel falls flat, lacking the charm and intrigue of its predecessor. Rather than adding to the legacy of the original, this film comes across as dull, uninspired, and a failed attempt at recapturing the magic of the first installment\u2014a sentiment that many viewers would share.\n\nThe movie's downfall can be attributed to its nonsensical plot, which fails on all fronts and comes across as a parody of the horror genre rather than a genuine contribution. Throughout its runtime, \"Return to Cabin By The Lake\" veers into soap-opera territory with its laughable dialogue, awkward cinematography, and uninspired direction, creating an unintentionally comedic effect that dampens any semblance of horror.\n\nIn light of these shortcomings, my sincere advice to fellow viewers would be to steer clear of this film at all costs. It is a cinematic misfire that offers little, if any, value to audiences, even those with a penchant for so-bad-it's-good filmmaking. Consider this a cautionary warning for those considering a late-night viewing choice that may not be worth the investment.", "Outlandish follow-up defies belief extensively as wicked sociopath Stanley Kaldwell makes a comeback by infiltrating a movie production based on his novel about garden drownings, cleverly masquerading as the second unit director he previously eliminated. The film playfully mocks the film industry, using a sardonic screenplay to lampoon dictatorial directors who engage in questionable relationships with their actresses to further their careers, while resenting any challenges to their dominance. Unfortunately, Brian Krause's exaggerated performance hinders the satire, rendering it jarringly forced. The narrative revolves around the power struggle between the volatile director, played by Krause, and the authoritative screenplay writer, Alison, portrayed by Dahlia Salem. Andrew Moxham portrays Paul Parsons, seeking vengeance for his sibling's murder featured in the first installment. The sequel capitalizes on dark humor by exploring the absurdity of a serial killer navigating a film set, with Stanley manipulating events to maintain control. As Alison uncovers Stanley's true identity, the film delves into her complex dynamic with the killer, adding a layer of irony to the dark comedy. The climax between Alison and Stanley culminates in an incredibly far-fetched resolution that challenges the audience's suspension of disbelief. Unlike its predecessor's sophisticated cinematography, the sequel employs superfluous techniques like odd camera angles and slow-motion effects, detracting from the overall impact. Overall, this follow-up falls short of the original's mark, with its humor coming across as less effective and more overt.", "\"Return to Cabin by the Lake lacked in quality, likely due to a low budget resulting in a mix of movie-quality and simple video camera shots within the same scene. The blend is odd and could have been improved by avoiding the 'home video' effect. If you have seen the original CBTL, it may be worth watching to compare the differences. However, if you haven't seen the original, watching this one first may make it seem too cheesy and turn you off from the original.\"", "This made-for-TV movie, while not reaching the standard of a feature film, offers moments of mild humor amidst its sub-par script and overly dramatic acting, common in lower-budget productions. However, a major flaw is the inconsistency in filming style, with most scenes shot on film, but occasional segments shot on video, resulting in a jarring contrast in picture quality and frame rates. While not the worst movie out there, this inconsistency detracts from its overall quality and makes it hard to recommend for viewing.", "If you're thinking of watching this film, I highly recommend thinking twice. I don't usually share my thoughts on TV shows, but this one left me feeling like I needed to do something worthwhile to shake off the disappointment. Criticizing all the flaws in this movie would be an endless task. Simply put, please avoid watching it. It was a total letdown for me, and I am certain you won't find it any different. Anyone praising this movie is either clueless or part of the marketing team. I can assure you, you'll regret watching it!", "I watched this on the Sci-Fi channel. It aired after the first movie. For some reason, this film managed to keep my interest. Please stop asking why. \n\nSpoiler alert: It was rather corny how the main character was roped into the movie-making process. In the initial film, he had a \u201creason\u201d to commit the murders, but in this sequel, almost half of them seemed to lack purpose. Stanley killed the director and captured the co-writer due to creative disputes, but attempting to kill off the cast was nonsensical as without them, there would be no movie. Was the aim for the deaths to appear real? If it was a high-budget production, they should have utilized special effects. As expected, similar to the first movie, the captured girl manages to escape, Stanley gets injured, and mysteriously disappears. Wow, what a surprise (sarcasm). This sequel had potential, and what\u2019s truly disheartening is that I would even consider watching \u201cCabin by the Lake 3\u201d. The only redeeming factor is Judd Nelson, as he is the standout in this sequel.", "I watched \"Cabin by the Lake\" this afternoon on USA. Considering this TV movie was interesting enough to make me want to watch the sequel, I tuned in for the airing this evening. However, I was extremely disappointed. The excessive use of DV (digital video) shots left me perplexed as they seemed out of place and lacking a logical explanation within the plot. While the open ending of \"Cabin by the Lake\" was acceptable, the sequel's open ending felt ridiculous. The potential for a movie like \"Return of Return to The Cabin by the Lake\" to be enjoyable is slim, possibly only if aired against infomercials at 4 o'clock in the morning.", "This sequel falls short of the impact delivered by the original. Judd Nelson plays a murderous screenwriter who adopts various identities to bring his novel, CABIN BY THE LAKE, to life on screen. The film still features brutal killings, but it veers into a very tongue-in-cheek territory without offering much humor. The project feels rushed, and at times Nelson's performance comes across as overly exaggerated. The storyline revolves around a script going through revisions before production, and it's clear that this script should have undergone its own substantial rewrite.", "\"Return to Cabin by the Lake falls short of the original with only one main character returning. This lackluster sequel is not worth your valuable time. As a huge fan of the first film, I found the story and acting to be top-notch, but this installment failed to impress. It's comparable to disappointing sequels like those of Urban Legends and Blair Witch, but with even worse acting that rivals soap opera performances. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this film - it simply doesn't live up to its predecessor.\"", "Hedy Burress, who miraculously escaped the first movie's watery grave, is noticeably absent in part two. I anticipated her presence but was disappointed. Perhaps she should have met a fate similar to Friday The 13th Part 2. This film, similar to Scream 3 and Urban Legend 2, delves into the concept of movies within movies. However, my verdict is clear - the entire premise is pure garbage. I advise steering clear of this one.", "Viewers praising the title sequence of this film might make you think it's amazing, but trust me, it's actually embarrassingly bad. The story follows a RAF pilot who narrowly escapes death and ends up romantically entwined with an air traffic controller. Despite some strange homoerotic undertones, the movie clumsily addresses love and stereotypes in a convoluted way. The poor production quality, including bad editing and lighting, is overshadowed by the terrible script. The attempts at cinematic techniques like Technicolor and foreshadowing fall flat, making the overall experience more funny than anything else. While some beach scenes are visually appealing, the rest of the film goes downhill fast. It's so bad that it's almost comedic, which is the only positive thing I can say about it."]
