["I rented *I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW* due to its notorious controversy at release in 1967. Originally seized by U.S. customs, its reputation as a \"controversial\" film piqued my interest.\n\nThe plot revolves around Lena, a young Swedish drama student eager to explore life. She aims to create a documentary on what average Swedes think about political issues like the Vietnam War and U.S. race relations. Alongside her interviews with Stockholm\u2019s politicians and residents, she engages in sexual relationships with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.\n\nWhat surprises me is that 40 years ago, this film was considered pornographic. The sex and nudity scenes are sparse and not filmed like cheap porn. Despite potential shock to others, sex and nudity are common in Swedish cinema, even in the works of respected director Ingmar Bergman.\n\nI applaud the filmmakers for using sex artistically rather than for shock value or profit in American porn theaters. *I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW* is valuable for studying Swedish cinema, though it lacks a substantial plot.", "\"I Am Curious: Yellow\" is a pretentious and frivolous film. Male frontal nudity doesn't automatically result in an NC-17 rating; R-rated films can include brief male nudity. However, explicit female genitalia are absent in R-rated films and mainstream media, indicating cultural discomfort with female anatomy. Complaints about a double standard in nudity miss that female genitals aren't displayed onscreen outside of porn or explicit erotica.", "To steer clear of producing films like this in the future, it's worth noting that while this movie serves as an intriguing experiment, it fails to deliver a coherent narrative.\n\nWhile viewers might feel a sense of moral righteousness for enduring it, given its coverage of numerous IMPORTANT topics, it ultimately lacks any clear purpose. Watching it, you'll depart without any fresh insights, unless your mind drifts\u2014an inevitable occurrence during such a purposeless film.\n\nYour time might be better spent observing the growth of a tree outside your window.", "This film seems to draw inspiration from Godard's \"Masculin, f\u00e9minin,\" but if you truly want a captivating experience, I highly recommend watching the original instead.\n\nWhile the film boasts two notable strengths\u2014the realistic acting and the surprisingly good cinematography\u2014it's hard to overlook the overwhelming silliness throughout. Lena Nyman's performance feels frustratingly na\u00efve, and the excessive nudity does nothing to make it more appealing. In stark contrast to Godard's intellectual approach, this film replaces depth with superficiality, perhaps reflecting the differing cultural ideals of French and Swedish societies of the time.\n\nIn the end, it's a product of its era and origin. My rating: 2/10.", "Oh, boy... After hearing endless hype about this absurd movie for what feels like an eternity, I can't help but recall that old Peggy Lee tune... \n\n\"Is that all there is?\" I was just a young teenager when this bizarre film made its splash in the U.S. Too young to watch it in theaters (though I did manage to sneak into \"Goodbye Columbus\"). Years later, a local film museum had a screening - finally, my chance to see it, but now I was as old as my parents were when they reluctantly went to see it!\n\nThe ONLY reason this film didn't vanish into obscurity was its infamous obscenity case upon its U.S. release. MILLIONS flocked to see this dud, expecting a racy film... Instead, they got a slew of closeups of unpleasant Swedes, street interviews in bland shopping centers, ridiculous political posturing, and lifeless pseudo-sex scenes with uninspiring, pale actors.\n\nCultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact\u2014whatever you want to call it, just shred it, burn it, and bury the ashes in a lead box!\n\nElite critics still scramble to unearth some value in its dull, pseudo-revolutionary political ramblings. But if not for the censorship controversy, it would have been ignored and forgotten.\n\nYet, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" title was echoed for years as a tease for various films (I Am Curious, Lavender for LGBTQ films, I Am Curious, Black for blaxploitation films, etc.), and every decade or so, it gets resurrected for another batch of curious viewers hunting for that \"naughty sex film\" that \"changed cinema forever...\"\n\nGood grief, steer clear of it like the plague. Or if you absolutely must see it \u2013 rent the video and skip to the \"dirty\" parts just to get it over with.", "This is at the top of my list of unwatchable films. There are bad movies, and then there are those you're expected to appreciate but can't even sit through. The once-shocking sex scenes are now dull, and the controversial politics are juvenile Marxism. The film is pretentiously artsy, with harsh, grainy black-and-white photography, out-of-focus scenes, poor angles, and bad sound. How can anyone call this art?", "The screenplay for this movie clearly missed the mark on accurately depicting Lucille Ball's life, showing no evidence of research, not even from her autobiography. The film is riddled with factual errors, covering her early days in Celoron and Jamestown to her later life with Desi Arnaz. The number of inaccuracies is staggering, enough to fill pages. Lucille Ball is a unique, inimitable person who cannot be authentically portrayed by anyone else. If I were Lucie Arnaz or Desi Arnaz Jr., I would be furious at the numerous mistakes made in this film. Despite the filmmakers' efforts, the movie comes across as extremely sloppy.", "When I first caught a glimpse of this movie, I immediately noticed the actress playing Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is utterly disappointing. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with remarkable talent, and seeing a legend like her depicted so poorly is distressing. It's unbelievable that, out of all the actresses who could have done Lucy justice, the producers chose Rachel York. While York might excel in other roles, capturing Lucille Ball's essence is a formidable challenge. Though finding a perfect match for Lucille Ball in terms of looks and talent is difficult, they could have cast someone closer to her qualities. York's performance in classic \"I Love Lucy\" scenes, such as the chocolate factory or vitameatavegamin episodes, fails to capture Lucy's expressions, voice, or movements in any way.\n\nAdding to the disappointment, Danny Pino's portrayal of Desi Arnaz is dreadful. Pino doesn't fit Ricky's character; he's small and skinny, his accent is unconvincing, and his acting is far from believable. Although Fred and Ethel were not spot-on either, they were at least not as egregiously miscast as Lucy and Ricky.\n\nOverall, the casting is terrible, and the story is poorly conveyed. For those wishing to understand the real-life story of Lucille Ball, I recommend watching A&E's Biography of Lucy and Desi, reading Lucille Ball's autobiography, or viewing PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. For a better docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" is a superior choice, offering a much closer representation of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz.", "Who are the \"They\" being referenced here? Actors? Filmmakers? It certainly can't be the audience\u2014this film ranks among the most superficial productions ever. It feels like everyone had a blast making it, maybe too much fun, to the point where nobody seemed to actually work. That vibe typically translates to a film that's not enjoyable to watch.\n\nJohn Ritter wears glasses to underline his character's resemblance to the bespectacled Peter Bogdanovich, but the scenes with the charming Dorothy Stratten, while sweet, give off a cringy \"look, I'm dating the prom queen\" vibe. Ben Gazzara tries to inject some life into a lackluster plot but fails, mostly wandering through scenes with a sleepy disinterest while supposedly chasing Audrey Hepburn. Concurrently, the children of the budding couple (interestingly played by Bogdanovich's daughters) throw around cuteness while absorbing some questionable lessons about love, just by observing their parents. Audrey Hepburn admirably rises above it all, essentially playing herself, which isn't too much of a stretch. Sure, everyone looks fabulous, but if that's what you're after, you might as well flip through Vogue.\n\nIt needs to be pointed out that Colleen Camp manages to be thoroughly annoying, even before she starts singing. While her singing is passable, it's entirely unconvincing. The country and western numbers clash so badly with the rest of the soundtrack you have to wonder what Gershwin, whose song inspired the film's title, would think. Gershwin's musical comedies of the 1920s may have been lightweight, but they were certainly charming. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on good intentions, but Peter Bogdanovich fails to rein it in.\n\nThe tragic death of Dorothy Stratten gives this film a special place in Bogdanovich's heart. He went so far as to buy it back from the producers and distribute it himself, ultimately going bankrupt when it didn't succeed. His Hollywood journey is one of the more sympathetic and tragic tales, so it's no pleasure to criticize this film. There is genuine emotion in Stratten's scenes, but \"They All Laughed\" pales in comparison to \"The Last Picture Show,\" \"Paper Moon,\" or \"What's Up, Doc?\" With this film, along with \"Daisy Miller\" and \"At Long Last Love,\" Bogdanovich's decline was cemented.\n\nIn the end, the movie is harmless, just a waste of a rental. If I want to see people enjoying themselves, I'll head to the park on a sunny day. For cinematic expressions of joy and love, I'll stick with Ernst Lubitsch and Jacques Demy.", "Peter Bogdanovich's film, based loosely on his life, features detectives who effortlessly date beautiful models, resembling millionaire playboys more than sleuths. Written entirely by Bogdanovich, the movie reflects his detachment from reality, resulting in a narrative that leaves audiences bored, confused, and perhaps jealous. It's primarily a curio for those interested in seeing Dorothy Stratten, who was tragically murdered post-filming. Patti Hansen, a model who later married Keith Richards, delivers a far more significant and compelling performance than Stratten, whose role feels tacked on and irrelevant to the convoluted plot. Ultimately, the film is an irritating snore fest, relatable only to a rarefied few, filled with insider jokes that alienate most viewers.", "It was nostalgic and enjoyable to see some of my favorite stars from 30 years ago, including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn, who all looked quite wonderful. However, they were not given substantial characters or compelling lines to work with. I neither understood nor cared what the characters were supposed to be doing.\n\nSome of the supporting female roles were well-acted. Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were competent and confident in their small sidekick parts, showcasing their talent. It's unfortunate they didn't go on to star in more prominent films. Dorothy Stratten, sadly, didn't get much opportunity to demonstrate her acting in what was her only significant film role.\n\nThe film does have some fans, and I approached it with an open mind as a big Peter Bogdanovich admirer. I enjoyed his recent film \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early works from \"Targets\" to \"Nickelodeon.\" Therefore, it was quite surprising that I struggled to stay awake while watching this one.\n\nIronically, this movie centers on a detective agency where detectives and clients develop romantic relationships. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybill Shepherd, starred in the hit television series \"Moonlighting,\" which borrowed this plot idea. The primary difference is that the series thrived on witty dialogue, whereas this film relied on slapstick and sporadic screwball lines.\n\nBottom line: It\u2019s no \"Paper Moon,\" and a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc.\"", "Those praising this movie must be thinking of another film. I expected it to be bad, but the script (or lack thereof) renders it pointless. While the actors and crew are competent, they can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. Ben G fans should watch any of his other movies; Dorothy S fans should watch \"Galaxina\"; Peter B fans should stick to \"Last Picture Show\" and \"Target.\" For cheap laughs, read Peter B's terrible book, \"Killing of the Unicorn.\"", "Under no circumstances should models and Playboy bunnies be cast in films. Bob Fosse's \"Star 80,\" which delves into the tragic life of Dorothy Stratten, whom Peter Bogdanovich was so enamored with that he later married her sister after Dorothy's murder, is infinitely more compelling than Stratten herself ever was on screen. Patty Hansen lacks any credibility as an actress. My anticipation of witnessing a lost masterpiece akin to Orson Welles' work was dashed, as what I encountered instead was Audrey Hepburn donning jeans and sporting a dreadful \"poodlesque\" hairstyle\u2014an utterly disappointing experience. Unlike \"Paper Moon\" and \"The Last Picture Show,\" which I can rewatch countless times, this film was an ordeal to endure even once. Allegedly, its release was hindered by the controversy surrounding Ms. Stratten's sordid demise; however, the true reason was undoubtedly its poor quality.", "It's not the cast. You won't find a better group of actors anywhere. It's not the setting either. The director is head over heels in love with New York City, and by the end of the film, you'll be too! Even Woody Allen couldn't top what Bogdonovich has done here. If you're looking to fall in love or find love, Manhattan's the place to be. Nope, the problem with the movie is the script. There isn't one. The actors fall in love at first sight, and words aren't needed. In the director's experience in Hollywood, that's just how things go on set. It feels real to him and his peers but is pure fantasy for most of us. So, in the end, the movie feels hollow, shallow, and doesn't really say anything.", "Today, I found the VHS of \"They All Laughed\" on sale at a rental store. Despite it being an old and heavily used tape, the cover attracted me with names like Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter, and especially Dorothy Stratten. The price was very low, so I decided to buy it. After checking IMDb, which rated it 6.0, and seeing it received four stars in the \"Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003\", I decided to watch it right away. However, I found the movie boring and overrated. The characters were poorly developed, making it hard to understand their roles. The plot, which revolves around private detectives falling in love with the women they are tailing, failed to amuse me. The coincidences in a city as large as New York felt absurd, and Ben Gazarra's portrayal of a seductive man was unconvincing. The main attractions were Dorothy Stratten, whose tragic story is well-documented, the stunning Patti Hansen, the timeless beauty of Audrey Hepburn, and the song \"Amigo\" by Roberto Carlos, who, despite my personal preferences, is hugely popular in Brazil. I will keep the movie in my collection only for these elements, particularly Dorothy Stratten. My rating is four out of ten.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Muito Riso e Muita Alegria\" (\"Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness\")", "This film is truly terrible. John Ritter is clumsy, 75% of the actors sound like they're reading from cue cards, the editing is poor, and the sound mixing is awful, making dialogue hard to hear over background noise. The plot goes nowhere. Surprisingly, Dorothy Stratten isn't the worst actress; at least three others are worse. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the enthusiasm of Ben Stein, making me wonder if she's dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful, with the oldest clearly reading from a cue card. This movie is seriously bad, which explains why Bogdanovich couldn't secure another project for four years. Please don't watch it. If it's on TV, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, find a new soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than endure this garbage again. In one word: sucktastic.", "I bought this video because I was interested in Dorothy Stratten. Despite having a great cast, there were too many subplots to keep my attention. The dialogue was stiff and confusing, and the story jumped around too much to be believable. I was disappointed, especially considering this was one of Audrey Hepburn's final films. I prefer John Ritter in slapstick roles; his performance here was just too pathetic.", "I plan to make a movie next weekend. Oh, I forgot I'm working... but I'll find a way to fit it in. It seems like the creators of this film managed to squeeze it into their schedule. I hope they have regular jobs because this film was terrible! It looks like a home movie, and I doubt more than $100 was spent on it! Complete garbage! How does this kind of stuff get released?!", "Pros: None<br /><br />Cons: Everything<br /><br />Plot summary: A female reporter encounters a hitchhiker who shares stories about people killed by zombies.<br /><br />Review: The Zombie Chronicles is, without question, the worst movie I have ever seen. Made on what appears to be a shoestring budget of around $20, TZC is an utterly dreadful horror film featuring dreadful actors who can't act and gore that is more nauseating than scary. It is baffling how such a movie even gets made. Simply put, avoid TZC like a contagious disease.<br /><br />Final thoughts: Amusingly, this movie was produced by a company named Brain Damage Films. Their brains must have genuinely been damaged to create such a terrible movie.<br /><br />My rating: 1 out of 10 (If I had my way, this movie would receive a rating of negative infinity)", "If the team behind \"Zombie Chronicles\" ever sees this, here are a few tips:\n\n1. In movies with \"Twist Endings,\" avoid showing close-ups of every death during the opening credits. It spoils the surprises.\n2. Despite your limited budget (and bravo for what you achieved with it), please invest in actors who can convincingly walk, talk, and gesture simultaneously. Joe Haggerty, this means you.\n3. When setting part of your movie in the past, ensure you have the appropriate props and costumes to reflect the time period accurately.\n4. Twist endings should be unexpected. While we don't want nonsensical twists, giving away the \"reveal\" as soon as a character is introduced ruins the suspense.\n\nKudos for the effort, but honestly, I'd prefer you hadn't made it. Only die-hard zombie enthusiasts might enjoy this.", "First watched on 8/3/2003 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-Brad Sykes): This 3D movie attempts to captivate with its depiction of flesh-eating zombies in a series of intertwined stories, but sadly it falls flat. While the 3D effects aim to add a new dimension to the familiar sight of zombies feasting on human flesh, this gimmick has been overused and lacks the depth that true zombie classics possess. It\u2019s not the flesh-eating that carries a great zombie film; it\u2019s the compelling, underlying story that truly engages the audience. \n\nUnfortunately, this movie fails to deliver on that front, presenting a tedious three-part narrative that feels like a dull, slow-paced imitation of Twilight Zone episodes. The predictable plot twists and lackluster storytelling result in a viewing experience that leaves you bored rather than thrilled. The final segment, revisiting the initial plot of a reporter investigating a supposed ghost town, delivers more of the same repetitive, unengaging content.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of the zombie genre, it's better to revisit the timeless classics that masterfully combine gripping stories with moments of visceral horror. Skip this lackluster 3D effort and seek out films that offer a more rewarding and memorable experience.", "There are many attractive women in this movie, but there's no nudity in it, which is disappointing.\n\nOne part of the movie is set in 1971, yet the characters are driving a Kia Sportage, which doesn't match the time period.

I didn't have this problem with this company's other 3D movies, \"Hunting Season\" and \"Camp Blood.\" Although the 3D in those films wasn't great, at least there was some 3D effect.\n\nOverall, the movie is really bad.\n\nHowever, the actress who played the daughter of the ear-eating woman was very attractive. I'd like to see more of her in films. She reminded me of a young Janet Margolin.", "En route to a small, remote town that intriguingly appears close to a freeway, a female reporter encounters a peculiar hitchhiker who offers to guide her to her destination. The hitchhiker shares two gruesome stories tied to the area: in the first, an adulterous couple plots to kill the woman's husband, only to face a far worse fate when they are attacked by a zombie; in the second, a group of campers has their vacation abruptly cut short by an undead outlaw angered when his grave is desecrated.\n\n\"The Zombie Chronicles\" is an attempt by writer Garrett Clancy and director Brad Sykes to create a zombie-themed anthology. It's a nice idea, but with just two stories, it falls short. This low-budget gore flick fails in several aspects: the acting is poor (particularly Joe Haggerty as the storyteller Ebenezer Jackson, who gives one of the strangest performances I've seen), the locations are uninspired, the script is dull, there's a sex scene with no nudity, and the ending is simply unbelievable.\n\nOn a positive note, some of Sykes' creative camerawork is effective, though the gimmicky technique used as characters run through the woods is overplayed. Joe Castro's budget-friendly gore effects are enthusiastic, featuring an ear being bitten off, eyeballs being plucked out, a face being removed, brains being squished, and a messy decapitation. These aspects make the film somewhat bearable, but be warned: \"The Zombie Chronicles\" is no easy watch, even for seasoned viewers of z-grade trash.\n\nI initially gave \"The Zombie Chronicles\" a 2/10 but am generously raising my rating to 3, considering I didn't watch it in 3D (though I suspect an extra dimension wouldn't have made much difference).", "I don't want to be a downer, but Brad Sykes has made at least two of the most boring and clich\u00e9-ridden movies I've ever seen - this one and Camp Blood. \n\nThe acting is horrendous, the quality is poor, and everything about this film practically begs the question, \"Seriously, could you make something better yourself?\" Maybe it's a challenge for all of us to flood YouTube with our own zombie-themed nonsense?\n\nI bought this for \u00a31, but remember, you can't put a price on 71 minutes of your life.

Fact.\n\nDO NOT WATCH.", "Amateur, no-budget films can be surprisingly good; however, this is not one of them.\n\nAh, another Brad Sykes atrocity. The acting is hideous, except for Emmy Smith who shows some promise. The camera \"direction\" needs serious reworking. And no more \"hold the camera and run\" gimmicks either; it just doesn't work. The special effects are unimaginative; there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes' other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar-driven metal (see the scenery comment).\n\nDid I mention the lack of any real plot or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter didn't.\n\nWhoever is funding this guy, please stop. I've seen some of his other \"home movies\" (which I will not plug), and they are just as bad. Normally, a \"director\" will grow and learn from his previous efforts; not this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker, but anyone can be a hack.\n\nDefinitely not even a popcorn film; of course, chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort.\n\nAward: The worst ever military push-ups in a film.", "It's not the best film I've ever seen, but I've watched it twice!

For example, 23rd Century Films released dozens of obscure Italian and American movies that were excellent. However, while Hardgore did release some noteworthy Fulci films, most of their output is lackluster, like The Zombie Chronicles.\n\nThe only positive thing I can say about this film is that it's not as annoying as The Stink of Flesh. Beyond that, it\u2019s a very clumsy anthology film with the technical skill equivalent to a Lego house built by a snail.\n\nAs has been pointed out elsewhere, you really have to be concerned about a film that includes previews of its action in the credit sequence, so by the time you see the actual zombie attacks, it's all old news.\n\nFans of bad movies might enjoy spotting the 18,000 continuity mistakes and the atrocious acting (especially from the hitchhiker, whose poor performance did make me laugh a bit). Kudos to Hardgore for embracing the spirit of things by releasing such a poor-quality print\u2014it felt like watching a worn-out home video of a camping trip.\n\nAwful, awful stuff.

After avoiding it for over a year, I finally sat down to watch it, and it was utterly dreadful.\n\nI nearly gave up on finishing it, but I felt it would be unfair to review it without seeing the entire movie.\n\nBelieve me when I say, \"this movie is awful.\" I'm amazed that some wannabe filmmaker was able to secure funding to make such a pathetic film. It likely cost no more than $20,000 to produce, requiring only a cheap camcorder or a phone camera, about 15 people with no acting talent, and a script that seemed to be written by a couple of drunken individuals.\n\nIn the first part of this horrendous film, a reporter named Tara Woodley hits a supposedly drunk man with her car on her way to report on a haunted town. Remarkably, he is completely unharmed. They go to what is supposed to be an abandoned house, but it is conveniently almost fully furnished, and a bottle of liquor just happens to be on the doorstep for the drunk man.

The lead character, an elderly man, spoke as if he had undergone a lobotomy, struggling to articulate more than one word every five seconds - a five-year-old could have performed better. The plot was abysmal, and the army guy exaggerated his role to the point of absurdity. I watched it purely for the unintended comedy, hoping it was just a prelude to the real movie. It's astonishing it was available under the two-night rental at Blockbuster and not a \"take it for free\" offer. There was one actor who was somewhat decent besides the woman, though. The only semi-acceptable aspect linked to the budget was the makeup. However, they managed to spoil it by revealing all the key scenes during the opening music sequence.

I couldn't focus long enough because the acting was just horrible. I believe it only garnered attention because it's available in 3D, which I didn't watch. If you're a b-movie enthusiast, and by b-movie I mean BAD movie, then this film is for you. Its home-movie, nonsensical style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake.

Lacking the funds to elevate his films beyond a basic level, he relies on audiences to appreciate them for what they are and envision what they could be.

He spins two spooky tales about flesh-eating zombies that supposedly haunt the area.\n\nNow, if you're thinking this sounds like the setup for a thrilling zombie flick, brace yourself. Haggerty's performance is unfortunately pretty cringe-worthy, which is a major downside right from the get-go. And those two spooky stories? They're actually pretty dull, made worse by the not-so-great acting and lackluster direction from Brad Sykes, the guy who brought us Camp Blood (1999).\n\nThis movie isn't bad in a fun way, like some of Ed Wood's cult classics. Instead, Sykes' homemade style falls flat, making the whole thing more of a bore than a thrill. Most viewers will probably feel frustrated and let down by this unimaginative, poorly put-together film. And the 3-D aspect? Totally wasted here.", "A woman seeking directions to a mysterious town is treated to two eerie zombie tales by the local oddball.

Imagine a film so atrocious, I fast forwarded through most of its tedious, cringeworthy content\u2014and, believe me, there was a lot to skip. Clocking in at a mere 69 minutes, it still manages to cram in an unbearable amount of filler.

Your DVD player might even flee, leaving you in VHS purgatory. You've been warned... 0/10.\n\nP.S. Seriously, what kind of 18-rated horror keeps the woman in a giant sports bra during the \"obligatory\" sex scene? This disaster can't even get that part right...", "Honestly, I can't believe I spent $5 on this movie. As a huge zombie enthusiast, I figured it couldn't be that bad because, after all, it featured zombies. Boy, was I mistaken! While the movie had a few noteworthy moments\u2014like the scene where the guy's head gets ripped off\u2014that was about the only highlight. Overall, I think it would be more pleasant to endure a highly painful scenario than to sit through this movie again. It might have been more entertaining if there had been some nudity, but I had to watch the trailers for other movies produced by this company to see that. Buyer beware... unless you enjoy suffering.", "I rented this film around three years ago, and it still lingers in my memory as the most terrible movie I've ever watched. I don\u2019t think I even finished it. It\u2019s worse than a homemade video by a high schooler. I recall a flashback to the 1970s, and in that scene, a man was wearing a polo shirt and Oakley sunglasses, and driving a modern SUV, something like a Toyota Rav-4 (I can\u2019t quite remember). I can't fathom how they could claim that was the 70s. He might have had a cell phone too, I\u2019m not sure. It was utterly dreadful. I returned it to the video store and questioned why they even stocked the movie, and if I could get that wasted hour of my life back. To this day, it remains the worst film I have ever seen, and I\u2019ve watched some really bad ones.", "**Spoilers Ahead**\n\nI had high hopes for \"Love's Abiding Joy,\" especially since I've been eagerly waiting for it to re-air on Hallmark. While I'm a big fan of the first three \"Love\" movies, this one really missed the mark for me. \n\nInstead of the inspiring and touching story I was expecting, the movie turned out to be overwhelmingly sad and depressing. The lack of continuity and poor editing didn't help either, with too many scenes feeling out of place. The premature death of baby Kathy felt jarring, and Clark's appearance seemed oddly forced and disconnected from the rest of the story. The cast also seemed disengaged, lacking the emotional depth that made the previous films so gripping. There was hardly any chemistry or interaction between Missie and Willie, which was disappointing.\n\nI wish the screenwriters had stayed truer to Janette Oke's original novels. Vital plot points from the book, like the mine and the two boys or Clark\u2019s injury, were completely overlooked. Missie and Willie's reactions to Kathy's death deserved more screen time and depth, rather than being briefly touched upon.\n\nAfter four films, \"Love's Abiding Joy\" has become my least favorite. Looking ahead, I hope the next installments stick closer to the source material. If Clark's character returns, I hope he gets a more substantial role that's more engaging. It would also be great to see more of Scottie, Cookie, and maybe even Marty. Who knows what the scriptwriters have in store, but I remain cautiously optimistic.", "I have watched all four movies in this series, and each one deviates further from the books. This one is the worst yet. The main issue is that it doesn't follow the book it's named after at all! The directors and producers should have given it a different title. The only similarity to the book is the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie, and Cookie). The children\u2019s names, ages, and genders are incorrect. The entire storyline does not exist in the book.\n\nI believe this is a great disservice to Janette Oke, her books, and her fans to produce a movie with her title that is so inaccurate. The music is too loud and the actors are unconvincing, lacking in emotion.\n\nIf you want a good family movie, this could work as it is wholesome. However, don\u2019t watch it if you\u2019re expecting a condensed version of the book. I hope this will be the final movie in the series, though I doubt it. If more movies are made, I wish Michael Landon, Jr., and others would adhere more closely to the original plot and storylines. The books are outstanding and would make excellent movies if followed closely!", "I was really excited for this movie. It's a great family flick, but honestly, if Michael Landon Jr.'s team had done a better job with the editing, it would have been way better. There were just too many scenes that didn't make sense. I really hope they make another movie in the series because they're all great. But if they do, I seriously hope they fix the editing. This one was all over the place with no clear focus, which is a shame because the other movies were awesome. I love the story of Willie and Missy; they're such great role models. And let's face it, everyone loves a good love story.", "I've read all the Love Come Softly books and understand that movies can't capture every detail, but they usually stick to the main plot. However, I was very disappointed with this film. The only similarity between the movie and the book is that Missy's father visits (though in the book, both parents visit). The rest of the story was so distorted and implausible that I couldn't enjoy it, even without having read the book. It was overly sad and, while I know pioneer life was tough, the entire movie felt depressing. My rating is solely for maintaining the family-oriented aspect that makes these films appealing.", "As a Southern Baptist, it saddens me to give a below-average rating to a Christian movie, especially since there are so few of them and I don't want to discourage filmmakers in this under-explored genre. However, I must be honest: \"Love's Abiding Joy\" is a low-budget, low-key film that is self-consciously Christian. The plot is predictable, the acting is mediocre (to put it kindly), and the editing is poor. While it might have fared better as a TV movie, as a feature film, it falls short. Keep at it, though. I'm sure you have a great movie about real Christians in you somewhere. Maybe look to G.K. Chesterton or C.S. Lewis for some inspiration?", "As a child, I thought the weapon the murderer used was cool, but I was also quite naive. Even then, I found the movie's plot to be dull and uninteresting whenever the killer wasn't using his light knife to kill people. What surprises me is the strong cast in the film. I wonder what script they read before agreeing to participate because the movie is undoubtedly boring and seems to exist just to showcase a light saber on a small scale. At times, the plot is incomprehensible, and the ending is completely chaotic. The entire film revolves around aliens and that single weapon. The story involves two kids and a man having an alien encounter, flashing forward several years to a supposed return of the aliens. There are dead animals to investigate, and for some reason, the man acquires the aliens' weapon and goes on a minor killing spree. Honestly, you have to question the purpose of this film. If you're going to feature a killer, there should be good death scenes; if you're showcasing alien encounters, show more than a strange light vortex; and if you're using light sabers, you might as well call yourself Star Wars.", "Jill Dunne (Mitzi Kapture) is an attractive, stressed woman, burdened by her smart-mouthed teenage daughter, Liv (Martha MacIsaac), and her petty, two-timing husband, Sean (Rick Roberts), both of whom are insufferably self-centered and obnoxious.\n\nMarketed as a thriller about a family stalked by a crazed killer during a relentless storm, the storm only appears in the last five minutes and is far from threatening. The stalking also doesn't intensify until the film's end.\n\nMost of the movie focuses on Jill arguing with her unbearable daughter, Liv, who has taken up with Zack, a boy of questionable character. They are often seen making out, much to Jill's frustration. Meanwhile, Sean continuously complains and criticizes Jill.\n\nThe story kicks off with Jill discovering a hotel charge on their credit card, leading her to suspect Sean. She visits the hotel and meets the sympathetic owner, Richard Grant (Nick Mancuso). When Richard spots Sean there again, he tips off Jill, who witnesses Sean with another woman but does nothing about it.\n\nJill later reconnects with Richard, and they grow close. Just as things heat up, Jill pulls back. Subsequently, Jill confronts Sean about his cheating, leading to a confrontation where Sean blames Jill for his infidelity. Jill confesses her near-infidelity to Sean, who, unsurprisingly, blames her for that too.\n\nThe dysfunctional family heads out on a camping trip, filled with more whining and arguing, particularly from the spoiled daughter.\n\nBy the end, I was rooting for the stalker to get everyone except Jill.\n\n3 stars", "This movie was terrible. Honestly, it felt like a total waste of time. The acting was awful, and the plot made no sense. Basically, these people get \"terrorized\" by a so-called \"crazed killer\" but don't even try to fight back. They go on a camping trip with a raft but no gear, and end up at a campsite that's already set up with food, clothes, and even the daughter's headphones. When their boat goes missing, they freak out about being stuck in the woods, but then the daughter's boyfriend just shows up out of nowhere. They never think about just hiking out like he did. Seriously, this movie is a joke. Don't let your girlfriend convince you to watch it.", "Lifetime failed again. The plot was senseless, and the acting, especially by the teenagers, was terrible. This clich\u00e9d story has been done countless times. The previews promised a good thriller, but this movie was a letdown. Unless you have absolutely nothing else to do, avoid it at all costs. It was a waste of two hours. Frankly, scraping my face against a brick wall for two hours and soaking it in peroxide would have been more entertaining.", "I must admit that I am quite surprised by the high ratings this movie has received. In my view, the plot was rather nonsensical. The concept of the mother experiencing \"visions\" upon touching certain objects or people, and the continuation of a vision when she touches the same object twice, seemed exceedingly implausible. Additionally, I found DeeDee Pfeiffer's performance to be rather lacking, as her portrayal was quite grating. \n\nOn a positive note, the actress who played Lori delivered a commendable performance, and the supporting cast did well with the material provided to them. \n\nAlthough I typically enjoy content from LMN and maintain an open mind regarding various films, this particular movie struck me as having an absurd plot and exaggerated acting, which ultimately did not appeal to me.", "The original book was set in the 1950s, but for the TV series, it was changed to the 1930s style, as that is more appealing to viewers. Ironically, the tube train near the end was a 1950s train painted to look like a 1930s train, showing that even the Underground can play along with this aesthetic. The plot centered around the Jarrow March felt weak, although the 1950s version had students beginning to think about the world around them, making them contemplate the marchers' poverty is somewhat similar. The subplot about Japp having to cater for himself also felt weak, but it seemed like filler to extend the runtime. This story could have made a decent half-hour show, or they could have faithfully adapted the book for a longer and better episode. It's clear that this episode suffered from prioritizing style over content.", "The intrusive mouse and unwarranted lullaby were particularly jarring and irrelevant to the narrative. Such elements are reminiscent of amateur endeavors from my first year in film school, which is quite disheartening. Furthermore, the story appeared to languish without purpose, as numerous unrelated components were haphazardly included. This gives the impression that the creative team either lacked a coherent direction or the project could have benefited from a more concise runtime \u2014 a change that would have been advantageous rather than detrimental. Having recently viewed all the episodes up to this point over the past week, I must assert that this was undoubtedly the weakest installment. I advise others not to commence their viewing experience with this episode.", "I saw this film on opening weekend in Australia, excited by the strong cast of Heath Ledger, Joel Edgerton, Orlando Bloom, Naomi Watts, and Geoffrey Rush. I expected to see the definitive story of Ned Kelly. Unfortunately, despite an excellent performance by Heath Ledger in the lead role, the plot was very thin and did not inspire me to read \"Our Sunshine.\" \n\nThere were some positive aspects: Joel Edgerton's strong supporting performance, assured direction by Gregor Jordan (who showcased his talent in \"Buffalo Soldiers\"), and production design that captured the harshness of the Australian bush as it might have appeared to early 19th-century Irish immigrants. \n\nHowever, I feel that this film missed an opportunity to truly tell the story of an Australian folk hero (or was he?), possibly because it tried too hard to cater to Hollywood and sell well in the US. \n\nAt least the filmmakers didn't agree to remove the beards just to please Universal. \n\nI guess I'll have to stick with Peter Carey's excellent \"Secret History of the Kelly Gang.\" 4/10", "I attended the premiere in Melbourne.\n\nThe film is shallow, two-dimensional, and unengaging, which is surprising given the subject matter \u2013 it felt boring. The actors did a decent job, but they had little to work with due to the uninspired and lackluster script. For those concerned that Ned Kelly\u2019s story might be overly intellectualized, rest assured, this version lacks any literary depth, presenting the tale superficially with stereotypical characters. However, it also fails as a casual, entertaining film; its pacing is uneven, and the execution is poor, making it unsatisfactory even as a basic action movie.\n\nI highly doubt that Gregor Jordan could genuinely believe that this was the best possible adaptation of the material.\n\nNed Kelly is a captivating figure, as is the national reaction to him. Whether seen as a folk hero, a class warrior, a psychopath, or a combination of these, he has been a significant part of Australian mythology for over 120 years. Unfortunately, once again, his story has been poorly represented on the big screen.\n\nSuch is life.", "Ned Kelly (Ledger), the notorious Australian outlaw and legendary figure, is often compared to a blend of Robin Hood and Billy the Kid. Australians cherish the tale of how he defied the English aristocracy, rallying the lower classes and leaving a lasting impact on the nation. However, this film conveniently overlooks that about 70% of those lower classes were immigrant criminals. Additionally, several so-called \"facts\" in the movie seem quite questionable upon reflection. \n\nIt should have been immediately apparent during the opening credits, which claimed the film was based on the book \"Our Sunshine,\" that this wouldn't be a historical epic but rather a romanticized adaptation of one of the many dubious Ned Kelly legends. Unfortunately, the result is nothing more than an exaggerated Hallmark channel-style \"real life historical drama\" wannabe. The narrative drags on alarmingly, evoking memories of Costner's lackluster \"Wyatt Earp.\" Essentially, nothing significant transpires in the film, and the journey to that nothingness feels interminable. This might have been more tolerable with strong performances (since the direction is certainly not praiseworthy), but unless the viewer is interested in exploring atrocious Irish accents, disappointment awaits.\n\nAdding to the dissatisfaction, the film devolves into a series of inane games: \"Who has the worst beard?\", \"Spot the obvious backstabber!\" (hint: they're all inexplicably redheaded), and \"Nature in Australia...including lions.\" Nature shots are gratuitously inserted, possibly in an attempt to appear artistic, stretching the runtime unnecessarily. Once all the native species have been showcased, a circus troupe conveniently appears, featuring a camel and a lion. The lion, inexplicably, is used in a fight scene designed to evoke more sympathy for the animal than for the slain humans.\n\nIn the end, this is a dry, unfeeling piece of historical fluff better suited for TV. The film lacks any redeeming qualities; even the usually outstanding Rush seems embarrassed to be involved. When a character remarks about having only two bullets left for him and his companion, it made me wish I had a gun to erase all memories of this film from my mind.", "They aimed for a fantasy blend of Man From Snowy River and Butch Cassidy, with a touch of romance featuring Ned and Joe with wealthy men's wives. There's a mix of Ned Kelly myths and facts, leaving room for artistic creativity. Unlike ancient legends, Kelly's story is relatively recent. I mistakenly thought the film would seriously portray Kelly's story like Peter Carey's novel. Instead, it fell short, and Mick Jagger's 1970 version might be closer to reality and better overall. Glad renting the DVD cost only two bucks. I'll give it 3/10, mainly for the nice Australian bush shots.", "This film is undoubtedly the worst piece of garbage I've seen in a while.\n\nHeath Ledger, considered a heartthrob, appeared deformed. Knowing he and Naomi Watts are a real-life couple would have saved me two excruciating hours wondering what she saw in him.\n\nOrlando Bloom as a heartthrob? With his scraggly beard and deer-in-the-headlights expression, I strongly disagree.\n\nRachel Griffiths delivered her usual fabulous performance, but Geoffrey Rush seemed eager to leave the set.\n\nShould I feel sorry for bank robbers and murderers? This film is a poor imitation of Butch Cassidy, which was genuinely entertaining. This production was trite, clich\u00e9-ridden, and boring. We only stayed because we hoped it would improve. It didn't.\n\nThe last 10-15 minutes were unintentionally hilarious. Heath and his gang, holed up in a frontier hotel, caused women and children to suffer. Though not inherently funny, their exit in armor reminded us of the Black Knight from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. We waited for them to say, \"I'll bite yer leg off!\" We and several other audience members were howling with laughter. Upon leaving, everyone agreed it was a waste of time.\n\nEven though I didn't pay cash to watch this disaster (sneak preview), it wasn't free. It cost me two hours of my life that I'll never get back.", "Were the term not devoid of geographical and semantic significance, one might aptly classify \"Ned Kelly\" as an \"Australian Western.\" For the inhabitants of Australasia, Ned Kelly stands as a folk hero, a bandit with a stature comparable to that of Robin Hood, Jesse James, Bonnie and Clyde, and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. As a progeny of Irish immigrants, Kelly turned into a fugitive and outlaw subsequent to a dubious accusation of shooting an Australian law officer\u2014a transgression for which his innocent mother was unjustly incarcerated. In retribution for this maltreatment by the government, Kelly, alongside his brother Dan and two cohorts, embarked on a spree of notorious bank robberies. This defiance resonated deeply with many in the countryside, who perceived them as champions of justice in a milieu where Irish immigrants frequently endured contempt and discrimination at the hands of the ruling class.\n\nPerhaps due to our prior confrontations with the \"gentleman bandit\" archetype, \"Ned Kelly\" emanates a pervasive sense of familiarity and lacks originality, adhering slavishly to genre stereotypes and clich\u00e9s en route to the anticipated climax. Ned epitomizes the archetypal, benevolent lawbreaker who resorts to lethal force only under duress and with profound remorse. He is also attuned to the plights of common folk, as evidenced by his act of returning a valuable watch to a bank robbery victim after one of his associates impetuously pilfered it\u2014an act emblematic of the selective liberality that endears him to the masses. This selective benevolence earns him the clandestine admiration of those who revel in defying the establishment and the prevailing order. Geoffrey Rush personifies the archetypal, beleaguered law enforcer, personally invested in vanquishing the audacious upstart who persistently flouts authority. The narrative even indulges in the predictable trope of a lady held up during a robbery who, enamored by the romanticism and audacity of the criminal life, retreats to another room for an amorous encounter with one of the robbers. The film abounds with clich\u00e9d scenes such as this.\n\nHeath Ledger fails to enrapture in the titular role, offering scant depth to render his character either compelling or engaging. Compounding this deficiency is the imposition of a monotonous voice-over narration, which accentuates the sanctimoniousness and pretentiousness of both character and film.\n\nWhile \"Ned Kelly\" may serve a marginal didactic function as a chapter in Australian history, as a piece of entertainment, it is merely a redundant narrative delivered in different accents.", "This movie was so unbearably bad that I could hardly believe I was watching it. The directing, editing, production, and script all felt like they were done by junior high school students with little knowledge of filmmaking. There was no coherent narrative flow. Major emotional moments and climaxes, such as an early scene between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts, and certain character relationships, appeared out of nowhere without proper setup, unlike what you'd expect in a well-crafted film. The characters were poorly developed, making it hard for us to connect with them. Surprisingly, the acting wasn't entirely bad, but the terrible writing overshadowed the relatively convincing performances. The film came across like a particularly bad TV western/epic, detracting from the fascinating true story it aimed to tell. I've read reviews claiming the film is important to Australians because of its subject matter. While Ned Kelly is certainly an important Australian historical figure, that doesn't make the movie good. A significant subject doesn't justify poor quality, as illustrated by \"Pearl Harbor,\" which, despite depicting an important event, was still a bad movie. Overall, this film is a complete failure, although Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom are pleasant to look at.", "This movie didn't get a theatrical release in our area, so I was quick to rent it as soon as the DVD was available. In hindsight, I should have heeded the critics' advice and skipped it.\n\nEven though the cast was impressive, the movie turned out to be quite a letdown. It's clear why it was released straight to video.\n\nI had high hopes with actors like Bloom, Ledger, and Rush, all of whom have been fantastic in their previous works.\n\nHowever, the film was sluggish and failed to engage me. I couldn't connect with the characters and found myself tempted to fast-forward just to reach the conclusion.\n\nI can't recommend this film, not even for the sake of its attractive cast. It won't even meet those modest expectations.", "I was really excited to watch this movie, but it ended up being a letdown. I felt like the storytelling was pretty clunky and didn't draw me in as much as I had hoped. Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom did a great job with their roles and added some charm to their characters, but overall, the movie felt forced and mechanical.\n\nThe start could have been way more engaging. Imagine if it kicked off with an intense shootout, then took us back to explain how everything led up to that moment. Instead, each scene felt predictable and clich\u00e9, kind of like watching a bad TV soap opera.\n\nHonestly, I was expecting much more from this film. The only silver lining is that it's slightly better than the Mick Jagger version, but not by a lot.", "\"Ned Kelly's story is significant to Australians, but this movie is terrible. It feels American, and though Ned was Australian, he has an Irish accent. It's the worst film I've seen in a while.\"", "From the outset, the film's political theme is overt and heavy-handed, rendering the plot entirely predictable. Good screenwriting, as any reputable textbook will advise, involves layering characters, incorporating character arcs, and adhering to a three-act structure\u2014all elements conspicuously absent in this film. The portrayal of the police is one-dimensional, depicting them as shallow, incompetent, and cowardly antagonists. The filmmakers appear oblivious to the notion that police officers might be honorable citizens who view their service as a means to contribute positively to society.\n\nThe narrative offers no opportunity for viewers to independently assess whether Ned Kelly is a hero or a villain. The film begins with his arrest for horse theft, yet it provides no clarity on his guilt or innocence. We see him entering a jail, but only discover much later through dialogue that he has been incarcerated for three years.\n\nThe film features numerous shots of Ned staring solemnly into the camera, which, combined with the lack of engaging storytelling, makes it arduous to watch. This modern directorial approach has significantly diminished my interest in viewing similar films in the future.", "I was immediately drawn to this film due to the compelling narrative and the leading actor, prompting me to watch it. Directed by Gregor Jordan (Buffalo Soldiers), the film follows Ned Kelly (Heath Ledger), who, after being framed by the police with Superintendent Francis Hare (Geoffrey Rush) at the helm, is forced to evade capture. He forms a gang to fight back and clear his and his family's names. Although I did not give the film my undivided attention, this encapsulates the primary storyline. The cast includes Orlando Bloom as Joseph Byrne, Naomi Watts as Julia Cook, Laurence Kinlan as Dan Kelly, Philip Barantini as Steve Hart, Joel Edgerton as Aaron Sherritt, Kiri Paramore as Constable Fitzpatrick, Kerry Condon as Kate Kelly, Emily Browning as Grace Kelly, and Rachel Griffiths as Susan Scott. Heath Ledger delivers a solid performance, and the film features visually captivating sequences, particularly during a gun battle towards the conclusion. However, I cannot attest to fully enjoying the film due to my lack of complete attentiveness.", "I don't fully understand the rating I gave The Amati Girls. In hindsight, being kind enough to rate it 4 out of 10 was generous. What might have been a wonderful story with a relatively decent cast turned into a complete farce for me. The movie is riddled with clich\u00e9s, the women's hair styles are dreadful, and most of the scenes feel unrealistic or fake. There's no genuine passion in this film; instead, it's filled with actors overacting to an unbearable degree. It's not funny enough to be a comedy and too fake-sad to be touching, making it simply not good in my opinion. I'm baffled how something like this ended up on my TV in Switzerland. Perhaps it lost something in translation? Who knows. It's definitely one of the strangest movies I've ever seen, and not in a good way. Sorry.", "This film was truly abysmal. The conclusion was utterly deplorable, and the narrative was conspicuously absent. The sole redeeming aspect of the production was the commendable acting by Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones, whose performances were nothing short of sublime. Regrettably, the film failed to honor their exceptional talents. Had the screenplay incorporated even a moderately engaging story, the film might have been worth viewing. Instead, the remarkable performances of DuVall and Jones were squandered on an egregiously poor storyline\u2014or lack thereof.\n\nThroughout the duration of the film, I found myself anticipating an event that would somehow coalesce into a coherent plot, transforming mere dialogue into a substantive narrative. This anticipation proved futile as the dialogue consisted of unremarkable exchanges reflective of the period, offering nothing special in terms of character development. The only noteworthy element was Robert DuVall\u2019s portrayal of a rambling, senile, inebriated old man.\n\nThe film\u2019s climax offered no resolution of merit, leaving me in a state of disbelief; I had endured two hours in the hope of encountering a moment of intrigue or significance, only to be confronted with the rolling credits, signaling the end of a plotless and meaningless experience. The revelation that I had squandered two hours on what can scarcely be termed a movie was disheartening. The entirety of the narrative spanned merely a single day\u2014the life (and death) of some Southerners on a plantation. One must question the narrative potential encompassed within a solitary day, Training Day notwithstanding.\n\nDespite the uniformly excellent acting performances of the cast, their talents were egregiously wasted on a profoundly disappointing film\u2014if, indeed, it can be dignified with the term \"film.\"", "Oh man, this was the worst movie I've seen in ages. The acting was fine, but there was literally no plot. Seriously, no plot at all! Just a bunch of people jabbering about random stuff, and that's the whole movie. Ugh. Robert Duvall's character is all over the place, just asking the same questions repeatedly and getting the same answers. I'm pretty sure this film's rating is as high as a six because people feel like they should like it. Great acting from well-known and respected actors, but the movie itself is a complete mess. Actually, calling it a mess is too nice because at least a mess suggests something happened, and in this movie, NOTHING HAPPENS!", "\"S.W.I.N.G!\" holds historical significance as one of the few remaining Black-produced and acted films from the 1930s. Many similar films have deteriorated beyond viewability, but this one is relatively well-preserved. It offers a fascinating glimpse of the talented Black performers from the period following the Cotton Club's heyday\u2014a largely forgotten era today.\n\nWhile the film is historically important and features some stellar performances, it is, unfortunately, a mess. The main plot mirrors those of Hollywood musicals from the same era, including a prima donna bent on sabotaging the show and an unexpected newcomer who saves the day. However, the writing is atrocious and occasionally trashy, projecting demeaning stereotypes of Black America. Before the plot fully develops, viewers endure scenes featuring a no-account bum living off his hardworking wife, a popular stereotype at the time. When he's caught with another woman\u2014who wildly overacts\u2014 the ensuing fight resembles a WWE Smackdown scene, complete with threats of violence. Later, when the prima donna misbehaves, her husband punches her, and everyone applauds\u2014a low point aimed at the lowest common denominator and poorly executed with some of the worst acting.\n\nDespite its numerous flaws in production, direction, and writing, the film is worth watching for its excellent singing and tap dancing, and for a glimpse into a forgotten facet of Black culture. Just be prepared for some truly terrible acting\u2014you\u2019ve been warned!", "Get ready to witness a unique twist of irony in \"The Sunshine Boys\"! Despite its title, this Neil Simon comedy delightfully subverts expectations with its unexpected lack of sunshine. Simon, whose brilliance shines through even without credit for the script adaptation from his play, humorously explores the quirks of old age. Walter Matthau's performance as a seasoned vaudeville performer reconnecting with his former comedy partner, played by the legendary George Burns, is a rollercoaster of laughs and surprises. Burns, who snagged a Supporting Oscar for his role, adds charm and wit as he joins the fray about thirty minutes in, setting the stage for comedic fireworks!\n\nThe film's hilarious chaos is directed by none other than Herbert Ross, who amps up the laugh factor despite the challenges of working with Simon's screenplay. The antics pile up in uproarious scenes, like Matthau's character auditioning for a TV commercial at a mechanic's garage, showcasing his talent for comedic delivery. Matthau brings such gusto to the role, making it impossible to watch without a grin! Although the character's exaggerated antics are a bit over-the-top, they contribute to the film's wild, unfettered energy. \n\n\"The Sunshine Boys\" may not burst with color, but it offers a spirited journey, setting up zany gags and delivering on the promise of relentless comedy. Sure, the film ambles at its own quirky pace, but that's part of its undeniable charm! Buckle up for a ride full of hilarity and memorable performances, guaranteed to keep you entertained from start to finish. **1/2 from ****!", "I absolutely adore Goldie Hawn and was thrilled to find another one of her films! So, when I spotted Protocol for just $5.50 at Walmart, I couldn\u2019t resist snapping it up. While the film had its moments of fun, it just didn't quite take off like I hoped. Some scenes dragged a bit, like the excessively long bar party that didn't seem to add much.\n\nAnd then, there's the preachy scene at the end which, personally, left a sour note. It felt a bit out of place, and I'm not fond of comedies trying to deliver a moral lesson, especially in such a heavy-handed way.\n\nUltimately though, I'm happy to add another Goldie Hawn movie to my collection, even if it wasn\u2019t quite the bargain I hoped it would be!", "\"Protocol\" is an entertaining film that showcases the delightful and charming Goldie Hawn, supported by a strong cast of supporting actors. The plot follows a quirky cocktail waitress who unexpectedly becomes a hero after saving an Arab dignitary's life. While the storyline loses some momentum midway through, Goldie's endearing performance keeps things enjoyable. It's definitely worth watching if you're a fan of Goldie Hawn.", "An executive producer in a movie is typically the individual responsible for securing the financial backing necessary to bring the film to fruition. In many films featuring Sean Connery, you\u2019ll often see that he not only stars but also serves as the executive producer. This dual role indicates that Connery himself raised the funds, showcasing his significant influence in Hollywood. However, it's important to note that many movies starring Sean Connery were made purely because he managed to secure the financing. When the credits reveal that the executive producer and the lead actor are the same person, it often suggests that the film is primarily a vehicle for the star, with the story or screenplay potentially lacking in quality.\n\nFor instance, take the movie PROTOCOL, which chronicles the adventures of Sunny Davis, an eccentric cocktail waitress who becomes a top diplomat after saving a visiting dignitary. Despite the implausibility of the plot, the story progresses to even more far-fetched scenarios. Starring Goldie Hawn, who also served as the film's executive producer, PROTOCOL exemplifies the notion that when a film is driven by its star's influence, the script may fall short.", "The premise is implausible and fails to evoke much humor or engagement. However, Hawn's renowned charm manages to barely sustain the film. Goldie Hawn stands out as an actress who has achieved so much despite often working with subpar material.", "There are only two movies I would rate 1/10: this one and \"The Man Who Fell to Earth.\" I saw Protocol in a theater in the early '80s when I was in high school, and the script was an insult to anyone's (even a high school student's) intelligence. It completely lost me with the \"hilarious\" gag of someone getting shot in the butt. Goldie Hawn is supposed to be charming but comes off as vapid and moronic. The film also includes offensive Arab stereotypes and ends with Goldie winning everyone over by spouting populist nonsense. The acting was terrible, including Goldie Hawn's. I couldn't bear to watch another movie with her until she redeemed herself, in my opinion, in Everyone Says I Love You. This is the kind of movie you make if you want to put no effort into the screenplay. The worst.", "The only memorable aspect of this film was the scene featuring Goldie Hawn in her revealing French-cut bikini panties as she struggled playfully with a dozen other women attempting to remove her skimpy cotton top, all while giggling and teasing. This evocative moment, reminiscent of Nina Hartley's sensuality, stood out in the movie that came out when I was fourteen and left a lasting impression on me. I had tucked this scene away in the recesses of my mind until I recently saw it on television, where it was unfortunately censored. This reminded me of what an incredibly attractive woman Goldie Hawn was in the '80s, and I can only imagine the exciting life Kurt Russell must have had with her.", "I was thrilled to find El Mar, a Catalan-language film, at my art-house video store. However, my excitement waned after watching it.\n\nThe film is well-made and beautifully shot, with a convincingly acted but violently shocking opening sequence. The somewhat improbable burial scene in the town square is a minor detail. Initially, it feels like a non-magical Pan's Labyrinth set during the Spanish Civil War.\n\nFast-forward, the three children from the opening are now adults. Francisca is a nun at a tuberculosis sanatorium, and Manuel and Ramallo are patients. Coincidences happen, I suppose.\n\nThe main issue is the characters' bizarre and incoherent motivations and dialogue, especially compared to well-crafted films by directors like Almodovar. The movie spirals into excessive horror and gore, earning its \"potboiler\" label. Imagine a 40-year-old poster screaming: SEE FORBIDDEN LOVE!! RAPE!! MURDER!! MUTILATION!! FANATICISM!! ANIMAL CRUELTY!! BETRAYAL!!\n\nThe film needed more flashbacks to make the characters and relationships believable. Without them, it feels like a depressing mix of \"Brother Sun, Sister Moon\" and \"Pulp Fiction.\" If that's your thing, go ahead. I'll opt for something less grim.\n\nOn the language front, the Mallorqu\u00ed dialect is indeed different from Barcelona's Catalan. Surprisingly, even Barcelonans reportedly needed subtitles to understand it.", "I was initially eager to watch a Catalonian film featured in Berlin's competition. However, following the screening, I felt utterly let down and angry. The movie was overloaded with gratuitous violence, stretched out for far too long, and juggled too many themes without purpose. Although the Spanish Civil War, much like any conflict, was horrific, this film's exploration of it, revenge, homosexual relationships, and Spain's skepticism towards Catholicism felt contrived. What Villaronga attempted to present as a pseudo-tragedy may be considered one of the worst in cinematic history. It\u2019s disheartening to see Angela Molina involved in such a project. I strongly advise against watching this film under any circumstances.", "This film was a major letdown. The relentless cruelty and violence were very disturbing, with some scenes being unnecessarily ugly and mean-spirited. The main characters were difficult to identify or sympathize with, and the lead protagonist was particularly unlikeable. The exaggerated theatrics created a suffocating atmosphere, and the film offered little to no insight into the Spanish Civil War. Having visited Spain, I can confirm that this portrayal is far from realistic. Furthermore, the use of same-sex attraction as a \"horror\" element was offensive and poorly executed, despite the DVD being marketed to attract gay viewers. The actors appeared uncomfortable in their roles, seemingly trying to distance themselves from this chaotic production. If you have a taste for watching children and pets brutally killed, this film might especially appeal to you.", "This three-part horror film centers around a man in a boarded-up house, fervently warning viewers not to venture outside, presenting three tales as cautionary examples.\n\nThe first story features a young couple who, after a car accident, encounter two deranged individuals. Despite leading to predictable twists, the segment is engaging, fast-paced (about 15 minutes), violent, well-acted, and executed proficiently. It is enjoyable, even if foreseeable.\n\nThe second story follows a man fleeing after stealing a large sum of money. When his car breaks down, he is attacked by a dog and seeks refuge in a nearby clinic. This segment is notably slow-paced, overly long at 30 minutes, and marred by obvious plot developments. Nevertheless, it showcases good acting.\n\nThe third tale barely qualifies as horror, focusing on a beautiful, lonely woman in search of Mr. Right. It is visually appealing with stunning set designs and an erotic atmosphere, including a well-crafted sex scene. However, it remains predictable and lacks any true scares.\n\nThe film concludes on a disappointingly foolish note. Overall, the standout is the first segment, which is worth watching, but the rest of the film can be skipped.", "This road movie tries to come off as trendy and modern with its editing style and unusual camera angles, but it ends up being cheesy and dull, causing nothing but drowsiness.\n\nThe cast is underutilized, and the writing is both stupid and pretentious. The only redeeming aspects are the excellent soundtrack by Lalo Schifrin and the unique and interesting opening sequence.\n\nAvoid this film if you can; the negative reviews are well-deserved. It's truly awful. However, it might hold some charm as a movie you watch when you have nothing else to do, perhaps on a stormy day when you're completely bored.", "This film boasts some stunning shots, capturing the landscapes with an exquisite light that makes the cinematography its standout feature. \n\nHowever, it feels more like a made-for-TV movie. While the numerous plot twists keep it engaging, the absence of subtitles for key Spanish dialogues will leave non-Spanish speakers a bit lost.\n\nI received this movie as a Christmas gift because it's a family tradition to explore films starring actors we admire. Matthew McConaughey, who was brilliant in \"A Time to Kill\" and \"The Newton Boys,\" piqued my interest, prompting me to dive deeper into his filmography.\n\nDespite the DVD's marketing, which branded this a McConaughey film, his screen time is minimal and underwhelming. Die-hard fans might be disappointed, as his role feels more like an extra, lacking the charisma we've come to expect from him.\n\nOn the bright side, Patrick McGaw shines in his role. He's not only visually appealing but brings a sense of kindness and care to his character that\u2019s reminiscent of a rom-com hero.\n\nFor a true showcase of McConaughey's talent, I'd recommend \"A Time to Kill,\" \"The Newton Boys,\" \"Frailty,\" \"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days,\" \"Edtv,\" and \"Amistad.\" Steer clear of \"Larger Than Life\" and \"Angels in the Outfield\" unless you're entertaining kids, as these don't truly represent his abilities, though they are amusing for children.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Scorpion Spring\" isn't a bad film, but it doesn't quite steal the spotlight either.", "I have been searching for this film for an extended period due to its rarity, as it is one of the infamous \"video nasties.\" At the close of last year, I finally unearthed it on DVD. It is an exceptionally low-budget production. The narrative unfolds among Amazonian jungle tribes who live in constant dread of a demonic presence. Laura Crawford, a model working in South America, is abducted by a group of ruffians and taken deep into the jungle. There, she is held captive by a ludicrous native who self-identifies as \"The Devil.\" She endures a series of deplorable hardships until her captors are satisfied. Villagers chain maidens and the so-called devil grotesquely demonstrates the consumption of human flesh. Peter Weston, the \"devil hunter,\" ventures into the jungle with the mission to rescue her.", "As I near the end of my Video Nasties list, this gem appeared. Its premise involves a fashion model kidnapped and taken into the jungle by a ragtag group for ransom. A rescuer, equipped with a helicopter and pilot, is given money to negotiate, with a reward if he returns both the girl and the cash.\n\nThe pilot\u2019s acting is abysmal, but they all are. Dubbing makes it unbearable. The jungle hides a cannibal cult whose \u201cgod\u201d is a naked man with poor makeup and ping-pong ball eyes. His constant growling on the soundtrack drove me to mute the scenes.\n\nThe film is filled with almost constant nudity, likely its main reason for being banned. There's one gore scene, but it's not enough for fans. Jess Franco goes beyond the usual exploitation with explicit close-ups of both female and male genitals.\n\nI can't recommend this trash to anyone. It's not even entertainingly bad\u2014just padded garbage. Only die-hard fans should bother, and even then, save it for last to avoid thinking this represents the entire list.", "Not sure if I'm addressing those who called this a video nasty or the director, but \"Devil Hunter\" is a bizarre 'horror' movie. \n\nThe plot loosely combines elements of \"Cannibal Ferox\" and \"Cut and Run.\" A woman is kidnapped in the 'jungle' by a 'tribe' of 'savages,' though the jungle looks like a Mexican park and the tribe resembles hippies in cheap Halloween costumes. The so-called savages are a diverse mix including white, Asian, black, and Hispanic individuals, as if Franco cast anyone who looked slightly ethnic.\n\nFurthermore, the film has minimal gore, no real scares, and excessive unnecessary nudity. It's not enjoyable. While I can usually find something to appreciate in sleazy Italian or Euro-trash films, this one fell way short.\n\n2 out of 10.", "This controversial video was originally banned in Britain but was finally permitted last November without any edits.\n\nThe film stars Ursula Buchfellner, Playboy's Playmate of the Month for October 1979. The beginning alternates between scenes of Buchfellner and misty jungle visuals, which seems pointless. Focusing on the bathtub scene would have been far more effective.\n\nIn the plot, Laura (played by Buchfellner) is kidnapped and held for ransom in the jungle. Peter (portrayed by Al Cliver, known from The Beyond and Zombie) is dispatched to locate her and the ransom. Naturally, one of the kidnappers (Antonio de Cabo) finds a way to occupy his time, while another (Werner Pochath) constantly complains.\n\nWhen the ransom exchange goes awry, Laura flees into the jungle. The question then becomes whether Peter can save her before the cannibals find her. Yes, there are cannibals in this jungle, which is why the video was labeled a \"nasty\"! Peter, along with his partner (Antonio Mayans from Angel of Death), discovers Muriel Montoss\u00e9 on the kidnappers' boat, where she is scantily clad. Peter leaves his partner and ventures alone to rescue Laura, now captured. They end up having sex, oblivious to the imminent danger.\n\nExpect scenes of blood, decapitation, guts, ample nudity, captivating writhing by a cannibal priestess (Aline Mess), and the memorable line, \"They tore her heart out,\" which turns out to be quite amusing when you watch it. Also, look out for an intense battle between Peter and a naked adversary (Burt Altman).", "Among Jess Franco\u2019s three works listed on the controversial Official DPP Video Nasty list\u2014namely Devil Hunter, Bloody Moon, and Women Behind Bars\u2014this particular film is arguably the least notorious, primarily due to its sheer dullness. Set against the backdrop of an uninspiring jungle, it scratches the surface of horror with clumsy gore, a gratuitous rape scene, and excessive nudity that barely keep it afloat.\n\nGorgeous blonde Ursula Buchfellner takes the spotlight as movie star Laura Crawford, who finds herself kidnapped by a gang of ruthless criminals and whisked off to a remote tropical island. The island is inhabited by a savage tribe that worships the 'devil god' lurking in the jungle\u2014a menacing figure devoted to devouring the hearts of nubile female sacrifices.\n\nTasked by Laura\u2019s agent with delivering a $6 million ransom, brave mercenary Peter Weston, played by Al Cliver, and his Vietnam vet pilot buddy navigate to the island, only to face treachery when the kidnappers attempt a double-cross. Amid the chaos, Laura manages to escape into the jungle but unfortunately falls into the hands of the island\u2019s natives, who promptly offer her to their fearsome deity.\n\nFranco directs this laughable escapade with his signature lackluster approach, infusing it with all his notorious clich\u00e9s: poorly executed gore, murky cinematography, unsteady zooms, gratuitous crotch shots, blurry imagery, cringe-worthy sound effects, and clumsy editing. The end result is a woeful mess that is excruciating to endure from start to finish. (I had to spread it out over multiple sittings.) Even the frequent views of the stunning Buchfellner in her full natural splendor aren't tempting enough to make me revisit this dire film anytime soon.", "How can you recognize a dreadful horror movie? When it has you laughing hysterically, naturally! The plot has been extensively reviewed by others, so I'll focus on the sheer comedic elements.<br /><br />\n\nSome reviews place the setting in South America, others in Africa; personally, I thought it was somewhere on an obscure island in the Pacific. The exact location remains a mystery. The cannibal tribe is an eclectic mix of a few Black women, some Black men, and a drummer who eerily resembles a young Frank Zappa. The Devil God is depicted as a large Black man suffering from an intense case of pink eye.<br /><br />\n\nOne of the most \"bizarre\" scenes in the movie features \"Pablito\" discovering his partner hanging from a tree, drenched in what seems like an orange substance\u2014presumably blood. He screams for an inordinately long time (which I found hilarious), and then his partner's head falls to the ground. \"Pablito\" gives it a slight kick, seemingly for the fun of it, and astonishingly, the eyes still move...<br /><br />\n\nBut any \"creepiness\" dissipates when you realize the eye movement is just another sign of the film\u2019s poor quality...<br /><br />\n\nI haven't laughed this much in ages. I highly recommend this movie for a lazy Sunday afternoon with friends. Grab some beers and enjoy the absurdity! However, if you're after genuine horror or gore, this film isn't worth your time.", "An actress filming in Africa gets kidnapped and taken deep into the jungle, where she's held for ransom. Desperate to rescue her, the producer hires someone to bring her back. To make matters worse, the jungle is inhabited by cannibals who worship a grotesque \"god\" with a penchant for consuming naked women.\n\nThis film is a gruesome and trashy spectacle, filled with extensive nudity and graphic violence, including against unclothed individuals. It's an exploitation movie meant to appeal to our darkest instincts. However, despite the bloodshed, explicit scenes, and the hideous creature, the film is terribly dull. The pacing is erratic, making it hard to watch. Multiple plot threads appear disconnected, even though they all converge into a single story. Most frustrating is the lack of dialogue, with minimal lines that revolve around cruelty or a character's defiance insisting, \"I'll do what I want.\" The movie is so silent and uninteresting that if it weren't for the victims' frequent screams, I'd recommend it as a sleep aid.\n\nAvoid this movie unless you're looking for a way to fall asleep or are an aficionado of Euro-cannibal films.\n\n(Note: VideoAsia recently released this as part of their Terror Tales series. The print is oddly letter-boxed, likely sourced from a Japanese version with censoring, and lacks opening titles.)", "If you've been waiting to see Al Cliver wrestle a naked, 7ft tall black man into a full nelson, your film is here! Laura Crawford (Ursula Buchfellner) is kidnapped by a group demanding a $6 million ransom delivered to their island hideout. Unexpectedly, rugged Vietnam vet Peter Weston (Cliver) is hired by a film producer to rescue her. They also didn't anticipate a local tribe that sacrifices young women to their monster cannibal god with bug eyes.\n\nSimilar to CANNIBALS, this film is more entertaining, thanks to a hilarious dub track and a goofy monster with bulging eyes (Franco confirms they were split ping pong balls in the disc's interview). Franco assembles a strong EuroCult supporting cast including Gisela Hahn (CONTAMINATION) and Werner Pochath (whose death scene is baffling, showing a close-up of someone not him pretending to be him). The film includes plenty of nudity and gore (of the Tempra paint variety). The highlight is the world's slowest fistfight between Cliver and Antonio de Cabo in the waves. Unfortunately, Jess stretches this one out to a painful 1 hour and 40 minutes when it should have been 80 minutes tops.\n\nThe Severin DVD mostly looks good but has some odd ghosting during dark scenes. Also, one long section of dialog is in Spanish without subtitles (subs are only available for the French track). Franco provides a nice 16-minute interview about the film, speaking more kindly about Buchfellner than his CANNIBALS star Sabrina Siani.", "\"Devil Hunter\" gained notoriety for being on the DPP 'Video Nasty' list, but it didn't deserve the ban. While the plot about a kidnapped actress and a hunter in the Amazon jungle offers a decent base, the movie lacks engaging scenes and drags for eighty-five minutes. Director Jess Franco has talent, as shown in his other works, but this film is not one of his best. If not for the 'Video Nasty' list, many, including myself, would not have watched it. Unless you're aiming to see every film on that list, there's no reason to bother with this one.", "This film felt excessively long, despite being just 75 minutes. The challenge with jungle horror movies is that they often include too many scenes of characters walking through various landscapes (such as jungles, rocky cliffs, or near bodies of water) to extend the running time. However, the movie is worth watching for its amusing and unclothed native zombie, characterized by large, bulging, bloody eyes and accompanied by a heavily reverberated soundtrack of heavy breathing. Eurotrash enthusiasts will find ample entertainment in the poor English dubbing, gratuitous female nudity, and the comically exaggerated makeup on the monster and native extras. Though it's a zombie/cannibal film, the gore was relatively mild, possibly because I didn't see an uncensored version.", "This is a poorly made, low-budget movie with terrible acting and a stupid plot. A mystic man who eats women? Ridiculous! If you have nothing better to do, like sleeping, go ahead and watch it.", "This is the worst TMNT franchise entry. Even as a kid, I thought it was bad despite liking the original cartoon. A memorable scene has a mafia ape explaining rhetorical questions, which is terrible. While many fans disliked the inclusion of a female turtle, it didn't bother me; she was so forgettable I had to be reminded of her. Overall, the show is miserably forgettable, with the theme song being the only decent part, serving as a guilty pleasure.", "This portrayal is the greatest disservice to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ever. Fortunately, Venus is not part of the official TMNT canon. The introduction of a female turtle undermines the poignant story of four unique male mutants who lack the prospect of having a family, emphasizing their irreplaceable bond. The crossover with the Power Rangers was a disastrous mistake; the voices were off, and the characters behaved inconsistently. A better approach would have included improved designs, animatronics, and no Venus.\n\nAvoid this at all costs\u2014it's cringe-worthy material. The lip synchronization was slow and unnatural, and Shredder was completely disrespected. The main villain, some Dragonlord character, was laughably bad. The turtles were cluttered with unnecessary accessories, like the strange band around Raph's thigh, and had poorly designed, sculpted plastrons.\n\nIf the turtles had their original look, stayed true to their characters, excluded Venus, eliminated the juvenile sound effects, and had a better-written script, this could have been a successful venture.", "I have disliked the idea of a female turtle since 1987. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT) have always been four brothers, trained by their teacher Splinter, battling their enemies. Each brother is named after a great artist: Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael, and Donatello. Introducing Venus, a female turtle, seems pointless and adds nothing significant to the story. I believe the original TMNT series from 1987 was superior. While adding new enemies in each installment keeps the story exciting, introducing a female turtle feels unnecessary and weak. We hope to see more of the TMNT series with the same characters we knew and loved from 1987, without the addition of a female turtle.", "This film is terrible.

I was surprised to see that they actually got Michael Madsen, but even he didn't do well.\n\nThe plot is terrible. If anyone says it\u2019s original or good, they probably haven\u2019t seen a decent movie before. Even compared to other Hollywood action movies, this one is really bad.\n\nDon't watch it!

It's frustrating having to waste time on this, but I feel obligated to warn others. Steer clear of this film. The acting is abysmal, and the writing is downright idiotic. Every aspect of it is terrible. The only redeeming quality might have been Deniz Akkaya, but even that was marred by a gratuitous and unnecessary rape scene. The movie is a poorly executed and utterly unbelievable mess of nonsense.\n\nAnd another thing, IMDb's rule requiring a minimum of 10 lines of text for reviews is infuriating. First, I endure this garbage film. Then, in an effort to help others, I sign up with IMDb only to find that I need to write a full-blown essay to convey how bad it is. Completely ridiculous.", "Assuming this won't be relegated to a straight-to-video release, I highly recommend avoiding this title at all costs \u2013 unless you're tired of quality, well-executed films.

When you can catch a continuity error just 5 minutes into the movie\u2014a shot-out, shattered window before any shots are fired, and then the window breaks with the first shot\u2014you know things are headed downhill. Unfortunately, this blunder is just a preview of what's to come.\n\nSpare you the details, but the movie is sub-par in every aspect. Even Michael Madsen's performance was disappointing, which says something when you're only expecting half-hearted acting from him. And the rape scene... My goodness! The line \"Shut up and take it\" should never be used in a rape scene. EVER.\n\n3/10", "Sometimes, a movie is so overwhelmingly bad that it can actually lower your spirits. You start to wonder why our standards for entertainment have fallen so low. Do filmmakers really expect us to sit through an endless barrage of clich\u00e9s and still be entertained?\n\nHollywood often makes a gun the central focus, driving the plot and conflict. It\u2019s the same tired routine: A character needs a gun, gets a gun, can\u2019t do something because of the gun, puts the gun down first, and then panic ensues because someone else has a gun. The character waves the gun around menacingly for 90 minutes, leading to a predictable climax marked by the sound of police sirens.\n\nFor this overused formula to work, a film has to be exceptionally clever and well-executed. Unfortunately, this movie is neither. It lacks life and personality and will drain these from you as well. It will make you feel worse about the world we live in. Who needs that? Honestly, this might be the worst film I've ever seen. Everyone involved in creating this soul-crushing disaster should be ashamed for contributing to such a disservice.", "Congratulations to whoever approved this. Edward Furlong, you're not as great as you think. You can't just grab any low-budget, amateur project with the sole aim of making money.\n\nThe filming quality is terrible. Honestly, anyone with a camera could achieve the same result, if not better.\n\nAs for the acting, let's just say you won't find top-notch actors at the supermarket. The good ones usually have a degree or at least some significant experience! The director, Jon Keeyes, you really need to find a new purpose in life because directing is not your forte. Your directing is poor, the angles are confusing (and not in a good way), the lines sound like they're being read off toilet paper, and the music comes in at all the wrong times and fades out for no reason. Also, avoid writing \u2013 making movies requires a certain artistry and skill, which, frankly, you lack.\n\nInstead of trying to create a badass shootout movie, this project should have been scrapped from the beginning. Perhaps try working at a coffee shop instead; it would reduce your stress and save moviegoers both their money and a disappointing night.\n\nVote: 1/10 (my first one)", "I rented this DVD without any prior knowledge. I was initially skeptical seeing Michael Madsen in a film I'd never heard of, but since it was free, I decided to give it a try.\n\nIn hindsight, Mr. Blonde would probably prefer to forget his involvement in such a regrettable film.\n\nIt turns out that a bad script and dialogues can't be saved, even by good actors. Add to that a slew of amateur performers trying to play native English speakers but failing to deliver lines that should have never made it to the screen. The dialogue is astonishingly unconvincing. The music is terrible and completely mismatched, giving the whole production a feel of a poorly executed school play.\n\nI suggest watching it only to appreciate other, better movies. This is the reason I gave it a 3, rather than the 1 it truly deserves.", "I saw a DVD at a friend\u2019s house and assumed it was a Turkish action movie with minor Hollywood actors. Intrigued, I decided to watch it later. It was tough to bear. When the credits rolled, I thought, \"We Turks really suck at Hollywood-style filmmaking.\" But then I realized it wasn\u2019t Turkish; it was American, directed and produced by Americans.\n\nThat made me wonder: How did they get actors like Michael Madsen, Edward Furlong, or Arnold Vosloo to participate? Probably with money. And where did they get such money? By using the cheapest equipment and crew available. If the budget was still tight, they likely wrote and directed it themselves.\n\nSo, despite what others might say, this isn't a bad movie. It made me think and even meditate, which many films fail to do. It leaves you in disbelief and makes you wonder again.", "What was with all the Turkish actors? No offense, but their involvement seemed pointless. The film completely squandered their talent. There was no script to challenge their acting skills, requiring almost nothing from them. I bought this film to see Michael Madsen, one of my favorite actors, but sadly, this film was yet another misfire for him. The script was terrible with nothing substantial for the characters to engage with, making them all two-dimensional. Madsen attempted to portray a tough guy, but the poor script and weak direction restricted him from adding depth or interest to his character.\n\nThe gunfight at the beginning of the film was equally disappointing. The sound effects were bizarre, more like paintball gun noises during a skirmish than actual gunfire. Even video games have better sound effects. And then there was this really annoying guy at the start, part of the robbery gang, whining in a nasal American voice with lines like \"Let's get the F#$k out of here\" and \"What are we going to do, man?\" He sounded like a girl. On the upside, it was funny enough to make me laugh for a few seconds. Whoo Hoo! What a dumb film. Poor Madsen, but he'll bounce back.", "This film was a major letdown. Initially, I skimmed the plot summary, and it seemed decent enough, so I decided to give it a try. However, the acting was abysmal. The actors appeared uncomfortable in front of the camera, making everything look incredibly fake. I feel particularly sorry for Edward Furlong, especially since Terminator 2 was my favorite movie a few years ago, and I've watched it at least 20 times.\n\nThe plot was equally disappointing; I suspect the writers were exhausted when penning the script. \n\nOn the bright side, it's the kind of bad movie that's almost entertaining because it\u2019s so dreadful. You find yourself watching just to see how much worse it can get, providing you with plenty of incredulous stories to share later about how awful it was.\n\nIn a way, I recommend everyone watch this, if only to better appreciate other, more genuine films.", "I'm a huge fan of Arnold Vosloo! Seeing him finally take the spotlight in a recent movie, rather than just playing a bit part, filled me with excitement.\n\nTrue, my background in film appreciation means I noticed a few things: the film's setting in an abandoned part of town felt too quiet without the usual traffic and curious onlookers.\n\nWhile the acting overall had its flaws, Arnold Vosloo's brilliance was undeniable. I chalk up the shortcomings to poor direction and an unimpressive supporting cast.\n\nArnold Vosloo absolutely made the film worth watching. Without him, I'd have dismissed it as just another mediocre movie.\n\nThe rape scene was disturbingly brutal and felt unnecessary, but the escape scenes at the end were well-acted, despite the lackluster shoot-out sound effects. There were some continuity errors, but those are forgivable in a film of this caliber.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed the movie because Arnold Vosloo truly shined!\n\nJackie", "This art film was made either in 1969 or 1972 (the National Film Preservation Foundation says 1969, but IMDb says 1972). Regardless of the exact year, it definitely has that late 60s-early 70s vibe, with the distinctive camera work and pop art styles you'd expect from that era.\n\nThe movie is basically three simple images that get distorted with various quirky camera tricks. There's music playing in the background, but no dialogue or story. It's clearly meant to be some kind of performance art. Like most performance art, it's intriguing at first but gets old pretty fast. To be blunt, it's quite boring and probably only interesting to the filmmakers themselves, their family and friends, and maybe a few people who think they're too cool for mainstream tastes.", "Nine minutes of mesmerizing, pulsating, and intricately symmetric abstract images create a mind-bending experience that borders on the surreal. At the beginning, a full-frame eye captivates your attention, and later, silhouetted birds against vibrant backdrops add to the visual intrigue. While it wasn't my cup of tea, there's no denying its intensity\u2014it felt about 8\u00bd minutes too long for my taste.", "\"Loaded\" is a film that features a highly attractive cast, which arguably stands as its most appealing aspect. This alone might make it worth watching for some viewers.\n\nThe movie narrates the journey of Tristan Price (played by Jesse Metcalfe), an aspiring young man from a well-off family, poised to begin law school. Despite the facade of perfection, his family life is fraught with high expectations and limited affection. His father exerts a tight grip on his activities, permitting him to leave the house primarily for educational purposes. This overprotectiveness stems from a past family trauma, hinted at through flashbacks and fully unveiled only at the movie's conclusion. Feeling stifled, Tristan seizes the first opportunity to break free when his friends take him to a strip club to celebrate his graduation. The night escalates to a beach house party where Tristan meets Sebastian Cole (Corey Large), who introduces him to the world of drug dealing.\n\nDespite its technical competence, the film is marred by a weak script and a lackluster storyline. The director's use of various camera effects, such as slow-motion, fast-motion, freeze-frames, and echoes, tends to feel misplaced and distracting. While these techniques are typically employed to depict a character's altered state due to drug use, their random and sporadic application in this film appears to be a misguided attempt at stylistic flair.\n\nThe performances are generally commendable, even though the cast comprises relatively unknown actors. Corey Large, in particular, delivers a notable portrayal of the main antagonist. It is likely that some of these actors will progress to more prominent roles in the future.\n\nFrom an aesthetic standpoint, the film scores high. The actresses are exceptionally attractive and nearly divert attention from the film's otherwise tedious content. Although the male characters' attractiveness is implied, further opinions would be needed for a comprehensive assessment.\n\nIn sum, \"Loaded\" fails to deliver a compelling cinematic experience. It does not merit a purchase, rental, or even a free viewing, as the effort to sit through it outweighs the sparse enjoyment it offers.", "This is it. This is the one. This is the worst movie ever made. It surpasses all others in its awfulness. I've never seen anything worse. Just retire the trophy and give it to these filmmakers\u2014there's simply no comparison.\n\nEven three days after watching this (for reasons I still don't understand), I cannot believe how incredibly horrible this movie is. It's so terrible that it doesn't even resemble a movie or a story and should never have been brought into existence.\n\nThis film made me question whether humanity is truly meant to do good. It left me feeling disgusted with our progress as a species. This kind of movie actually harms our society. We should be ashamed. Our global responsibility as creators of art is to prevent such gross distortions of our reality for our own good. It's an embarrassment. I can't fathom how the actors, writers, or the director can sleep at night knowing they contributed to making \"Loaded.\" I don't understand what kind of people enjoy watching these types of films.\n\nThat being said, I enjoy a good \"bad\" movie. I love \"Shark Attack 3\" and \"Bad Taste\" because they're hilariously bad. I recommend them to all my friends because they're amusingly awful.\n\nBut this... this crosses the line into a different realm of bad. It's awkward bad. It's the kind of bad where you can predict every line, action, death, and sequence well in advance\u2014often only five minutes into the film.\n\nEvery cheesy editing \"effect\" is used repeatedly to a nauseating degree. I never want to see the \"shaky\" camera \"drug buzz rush\" effect, jump cuts, swerve cuts, or any other fancy cut ever again. It's monotonously boring, repetitive, and tortures the audience.\n\nThe most DISTURBING thing about this movie is that a considerable amount of money seems to have been invested in this garbage. If I ever see the director, I will demand he go home and reconsider his life choices, or I'll do it for him.\n\nIf we ever needed a new form of inhumane torture for war prisoners, just keep showing them this movie in a padded cell repeatedly. Trust me, they might start devising more elaborate ways to escape after the 72nd viewing.\n\nThese movies are the most vile aspects of our society. Please. Stop. NOW.", "Sometimes, after watching a film, you wish you could get a refund for the time you wasted. This was one of those moments. I almost quit with only 15 minutes left and now, I wish I had.\n\nThe main character\u2019s transformation from a disciplined, controlled life to one of total irresponsibility happens absurdly fast.\n\nFrom a graduation party to the predictable ending, Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe), a man of privilege and refinement, lets himself be led astray by a seductive woman, violence, and mind-altering substances. While it\u2019s understandable he\u2019d be tempted by the alluring April (Nathalie Kelley), his quick descent into drugs, violence, and loyalty to someone he just met is baffling.\n\nHonestly, aside from the chance to admire Nathalie Kelley and Monica Keena, this film offers nothing worthwhile. Save your money and your time... do something else instead.", "Weak plot, predictable violence, and only semi-interesting characters. It feels like the writer, who also stars, was fictionalizing his own mistakes and added incredible fantasies of drugs and murder to make it \"hot.\" The rap and house soundtrack is predictable, the family conflicts are poorly acted and stereotypical, and overall, the movie is terribly boring. Even the title is unoriginal; IMDb lists five movies with the same name released in 2007-2008. I watched it on Showtime, which listed the synopsis for a different movie. I was halfway through before realizing there was no undercover cop. Even though it's another stereotype, it would have made it more interesting.", "All I could think about while watching this movie was how mediocre it was. People often mention that its strength lies in its realistic depiction of drug effects and the downward spiral individuals can experience. However, the film's techniques were overused, making them unconvincing and irrelevant to the overall story.\n\nThe plot was dull, unimaginative, unbelievable, and confusing. Most reviews of this film echo the same sentiment.\n\nAlthough some of the actors and actresses are attractive, good looks can't save a film with such boring action. The action scenes were sparse and uninspiring: just a few punches here and there, and a final shootout at the end. Nothing special.\n\nAs others have noted, \u201cbad\u201d movies can be enjoyable because of their flaws. This film, however, is just empty and unremarkable.\n\nIf you need an educational movie to deter drug use, I highly recommend other films that tackle this topic more effectively, such as \"Requiem For A Dream,\" \"Trainspotting,\" \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,\" and \"Candy.\" For a lighter take, try \"Go\" or \"Half Baked.\"\n\nLastly, the one potentially memorable line in this movie, delivered by Vinnie Jones, was taken from \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.\" It's disappointing to see a piece of that great film tarnished by this one.\n\nOverall, save your money and time by NOT watching this movie.", "According to Corey Large's IMDb information, there is a movie titled \"Reload\" in production (as of June 2008) in which he plays a character named Sebastian Cole.\n\nFirstly, how does such a poorly received movie get a sequel? Secondly, didn\u2019t Sebastian Cole die at the end of \"Loaded\"?\n\nI watched \"Loaded\" in the early hours while struggling with insomnia, so I was drifting in and out during the film. I probably missed some plot points, but overall, it seemed quite weak. In my opinion, Large's performance was one of the stronger aspects of the movie. I'm also surprised at the comments about the beautiful girls, as I found the actress playing Brooke to be pretty, but not exceptional.", "This film had a lot of potential and a relatively interesting plot, but it was seriously let down by the actors, director, and editors.\n\nI feel bad for the writers, as it could have been good. The acting is wooden, and very few of the characters are believable.\n\nThe editor clearly wanted to showcase new techniques, resulting in numerous quick, flashy edits in almost every scene. These were presumably meant to be symbolic but ended up merely being annoying.\n\nI wanted to like this film and hoped for a satisfying resolution to the plot's imbalance, but unfortunately, it left me feeling like I had wasted my time and that the filmmakers had wasted their money.", "This film is one of the most poorly executed I've ever seen. It attempts to mimic virtually every type of thriller, but ultimately makes a mess of them all.\n\nThere isn\u2019t a single redeeming line or character to be found. The plot, if it exists, appears to be an afterthought, and the acting is so subpar that it\u2019s best left unmentioned. I genuinely cannot comprehend how such a poorly made film gets produced and released. Does no one at any stage of production think, 'This is truly terrible,' and decide to halt the project?\n\nIt's movies like this that drive people to consider illegal downloads. The trailer is misleading, presenting a completely different film. At least when you download it, you haven't wasted your time or money.

The plot contains inexplicable elements that detract from the story. The film's overuse of special effects and stylistic choices, such as slow motion, camera shakes, and fast forwards, becomes tiresome after 30 minutes. Additionally, the excessive use of music, nearly equal to the dialogue in the first hour, disrupts the flow.", "This movie didn't quite hit the mark for me, but I appreciate that there are worse films out there. In the Gangster/Drug scene genre, it's tough to pull off a convincing storyline. Unfortunately, this film struggles in that area. Sebastian's motives, for example, feel a bit far-fetched and clich\u00e9. \n\nA believable set of character relationships is also important, and this movie falls short there too. While Tristan's separation from his family is interesting, the reasons behind it are a bit unclear. It raises some fascinating questions about rebellious behavior in upper-class families, but doesn't explore them as much as it could have. \n\nThere was potential for a solid socially critical drama, but the movie focuses more on flashy production techniques and special effects. This leaves little room for the characters to reflect and for the story to develop naturally. \n\nThe film tries to be a drama that doesn't glorify substance abuse and violence, which is commendable. However, it ends up feeling more like an average action movie with a decent cast. Vinnie Jones does a good job in his usual role, and the editing is pretty decent too.\n\nOverall, I just can't recommend it. 1 star for Vinnie and 2 stars for the editing.", "From the beginning of the movie, it feels like the director is trying to convey something. Instead of letting the story shape the style of the film, he seems to have chosen a particular style first and then crafted a story to fit it. Unfortunately, he has failed miserably in this approach. I suppose he was aiming to create a stylish movie. In any case, I believe this film is a complete waste of time and effort. To give the director some credit, he is knowledgeable about the medium he is working with; I have seen worse movies than this. At least he manages to maintain continuity throughout the film, and the actors deliver decent performances.", "I skimmed through the movie just enough to grasp the plot, but to be honest, I found it quite boring and, at times, confusing. The main reason I watched it was to see CHACE CRAWFORD, who is undeniably attractive, although his hair looked a bit odd in this film. Still, he was hot.\n\nDespite CHACE\u2019s undeniable appeal, it wasn\u2019t enough to redeem the movie for me. The plot wasn\u2019t terrible, but the excessive cussing in nearly every sentence was off-putting. Is it really that hard to express anger without constantly using the F-word? The frequent cussing and the flashy, shaky camera work gave me a headache.\n\nOverall, although the plot was passable, I found the film tedious and overly dramatic. That\u2019s why I only watched the scenes with CHACE in them. LOL! Anyway, I wouldn't recommend renting it unless you're a die-hard fan of one of the cast members, like I was. Oh, and the cast was definitely attractive. The girls were HOT, but CHACE IS THE BEST!!", "In this imaginative horror film, Vincent Price stars as a crazed magician who discovers that his unique skills have been sold off to someone else. In a bid to get revenge on those who wronged him, he devises an elaborate plan that ultimately backfires.\n\nAlthough Price's performance is slightly below his usual brilliance, he remains the primary reason to watch this suspenseful tale. The supporting cast features Patrick O'Neal, Mary Murphy, Eva Gabor, and Jay Novello.", "Had I not read Pat Barker's 'Union Street' before seeing the film adaptation, I might have enjoyed it. Sadly, that wasn't the case. While the film was well-made and aligned with my tastes, it failed miserably as an adaptation.\n\nThe novel's harrowing depiction of life in a northern England working-class area was deeply moving, gripping me with its raw portrayal of the women's lives. It was an emotional rollercoaster of tears, repulsion, shock, anger, sympathy, and misery. Despite its bleakness, I couldn't put it down.\n\nThe film, however, was a letdown. Hollywood glossed over Barker's stark realism with a sugary layer of hope and romance. While it featured inspiring music and excellent performances, it didn't do justice to 'Union Street'.\n\nKey characters were condensed into a single role played by Jane Fonda, and many important stories were sidelined. I understand the challenges of adapting such sensitive, horrific content for a broad audience and the impracticality of a film with multiple main characters. However, the essence of the novel was lost. The darkness, the rain, the broken windows, and the stench of poverty were replaced with sunshine, pretty houses, and a whimsical score by John Williams.\n\nIf you enjoyed the film's optimistic take on 'reality', prepare yourself for a much grimmer experience with the book\u2014think 'Schindler's List', but without the hopeful ending.", "I saw a brief review that mentioned \"great acting,\" but I strongly disagree. In my opinion, these are two talented actors delivering terrible performances with absolutely no chemistry. They are working for a renowned director who, unfortunately, has produced his worst effort to date. Robert De Niro's portrayal is bafflingly contradictory, while Jane Fonda's performance is erratic, likely due to the poorly written character she has to work with. The film's pacing is painfully slow, and despite its goal of being an uplifting story about overcoming illiteracy, watching it is nothing short of a downer. I rate it 1 out of 10, easily one of the worst high-budget films I've ever seen.", "Robert DeNiro portrays an incredibly intelligent yet illiterate character in an unremarkable film. The movie squanders outstanding talent to a frustrating degree. The script and dialogue are implausible, and Jane Fonda's role is an unamusing caricature of herself. The film drags on, is poorly shot, and comes off as excessively preachy while relying heavily on common clich\u00e9s. Though Swoosie Kurtz shines in a supporting role, it hardly redeems the film.<br /><br />Additionally, the new IMDB rule requiring ten lines per review is irritating. When a film is this lacking in value, it doesn\u2019t necessitate ten lines to inform others to steer clear. Save your time and skip this movie.", "This is the story of a man with unusual feelings for a pig. It begins with an opening scene that brilliantly showcases absurd comedy. A formal orchestra audience is transformed into a chaotic, violent mob by the bizarre chants of its singers. Unfortunately, the film remains absurd throughout, lacking a coherent narrative, which eventually becomes too off-putting. Even audiences from that era are likely to be turned off. The cryptic dialogue makes Shakespeare seem easy for a third grader. However, on a technical level, it exceeds expectations with impressive cinematography by future great Vilmos Zsigmond. Brief appearances by future stars Sally Kirkland and Frederic Forrest can also be seen.", "Oh, Bait. How much do I hate you? Let me list the ways. \n1. You try to be funny, but you're just corny and not enjoyable; every joke is predictable and doesn't make me laugh. Instead, I feel like throwing up.\n2. You try to be dramatic, but you're not believable; the woman overacts terribly, and the \"bad guy\" looks like Bill Gates and is about as scary as Bill Gates. Imagine Bill Gates trying to scare someone with a gun. It doesn't work. Jamie Foxx's dramatic scenes are ridiculous and make me want to throw up.\n3. You try to be action-packed but are dull and dragging. When the action heats up, the camera is shaky like in The Blair Witch Project, making me nauseous and wanting to throw up.\n4. You try to be a good movie, but you failed, FAILED, FAILED! I'd rather walk barefoot through the Sahara with no water, sunscreen, and only Meryl Streep for company than watch another minute of this movie with overacting and a badly written story.\n\nJust promise me I'll never have to watch a movie this bad again.", "The movie, despite its promising premise, falls flat. Although I'm a Takashi Miike fan, I consider this work, along with DOA 2 and 3, to be among his lesser achievements. Some viewers seem to give it a pass solely because it's a Miike film, but for many of us, the kid's endless screaming, slow pace, and lackluster acting are major drawbacks.\n\nFans of Miike might watch it out of curiosity, but they'll find it lacks originality and depth, reminiscent of \"The Neverending Story.\" It's Miike's first co-written film, but his signature style is mostly absent, aside from a few familiar shots.\n\nDespite its potential, the film fails to deliver. If you're new to Miike, start with his acclaimed works like Gozu, Ichi the Killer, and Audition, then explore Blue's Harp, Fudoh, Rainy Dog, and Bird People in China.", "The lackluster direction leaves a competent cast stranded in an attractive yet uninspired adaptation, wherein the dialogue appears recited rather than genuine. The underfunded appearances of the ghosts fail to evoke any sense of awe or enchantment. Edward Woodward, portraying the Ghost of Christmas Present, teeters on stilts and seems to imitate Bernard Cribbins. As Scrooge, George C. Scott exhibits excessive wryness and never fully convinces, diminishing the impact of his performance. The scenes depicting his past carry as much weight as if he were apathetically flipping through a family album. The rest of the cast appears to put in minimal effort, with the exception of Frank Finlay, who tends to overact dramatically.", "I was very eager to watch this film after finally having read the book earlier this week. My 13-year-old son was also looking forward to it. We rented the movie and settled in to enjoy a classic holiday story brought to life on screen.\n\nHowever, I was quite disappointed. The film diverged from the book more times than I could forgive. While George C. Scott is an excellent actor, in this film, he seemed fully immersed in his character only about 20% of the time; the rest of his performance was rather flat.\n\nI understand that this film was made in 1984, largely before the advent of CGI effects. Nevertheless, it appeared to be of very B-movie quality, particularly during the encounter with Jacob Marley.\n\nThe most significant disappointment was the omission of one of the story's most moving parts: the scene where the Spirit of Christmas Present takes Scrooge on a whirlwind tour of the world, showing people in the bleakest of circumstances still experiencing the light and love of Christmastime.\n\nOn a positive note, Mr. Scott did an admirable job portraying the \"reformed\" Scrooge at the end, which was a refreshing depiction.\n\nI do wish that Bob Cratchit had been portrayed as more ragged and downtrodden. As for Tiny Tim... let's just say I was not impressed with the child actor's performance.", "Having seen three other versions of the same film, I must say this one is by far the weakest for me. Scott's rather dull and leaden performance is the primary reason. His emotions are so bland throughout that it makes it difficult to engage with the film. Alistair Sim portrayed the role infinitely better. At Scrooge's meanest, Scott's dialogue lacks conviction, and his transformation is equally unconvincing. None of the actors in this film match those from the Alistair Sim version. Even the musical version (and frankly the Muppets' take on this) are better executed. Very disappointing.", "I watched this movie in my English class and was surprised by how bad it was. George C. Scott was great as Scrooge, but the rest of the cast was terrible. The acting was often laughably bad, and the repeated line, \"Merry Christmas to everyone!\" was annoying. \n\nThe movie, based on a Charles Dickens story about a rich guy who thinks Christmas is humbug, involves him being visited by three ghosts who persuade him to celebrate Christmas. \n\nI can't understand why this poorly-written movie is so well-rated. Instead of this, I recommend the Bill Murray comedy Scrooged, which was actually funny.", "When will the pain stop? I never want to see another version of A Christmas Carol again. They keep making movies with the same story, each trying to outdo the others but failing miserably because it\u2019s simply not a good story. It\u2019s moralistic, old-fashioned, and conservatively optimistic. It\u2019s as if people never learn.

However, in my country, it doesn't air until 10:30 PM. To pass the time, we decided to watch Father of the Pride, which was currently on.\n\nI've only seen two episodes of Father of the Pride. My first impression wasn't great; I found it not only unfunny but also pointlessly crude. I even thought to myself, \"I have a football game early tomorrow, so I really should stop wasting time on these cartoons.\" Nevertheless, I tried to give Father of the Pride another chance last night. To me, it seems like a poor imitation of The Simpsons, just with lions instead of yellow-skinned human characters.\n\nAdditionally, I'm puzzled by its TV-14 rating. The Simpsons seems far more vulgar to me, and the only notable rudeness in Father of the Pride is a few unfunny homosexual jokes. The Simpsons is also significantly more violent, especially in the Halloween specials, and cruder in its humor. Interestingly, I learned that the creator of Father of the Pride also directed Shrek 2. I have to say, Shrek 2 was much better, and it seems like the creator was too focused on family themes in this series. That said, Father of the Pride did manage to make me smile or even laugh out loud a few times.\n\nOverall, I don't have strong feelings about Father of the Pride. I don't hate it, but I don't particularly like it either. Compared to The Simpsons, it falls short. \n\n3.5/10", "This film is a futuristic adaptation of Jules Verne's \"Mysterious Island\" but is riddled with flaws. The sound editing is poorly executed, with on-set dialogue overlapping voices recorded in a booth. It's an amateur film with actors from Boston, shot in New Hampshire, which may resonate strongly with New England residents. Throughout the movie, you can hear the director giving directions to the actors, making it feel unprofessional.\n\nThe character dynamics are unusual: one character communicates telepathically, while a blue alien character speaks with a deep voice but reverts to the actor's normal voice when yawning or fighting. The special effects, by Brett Piper, are imaginative but the animation is notably jerky, reminiscent of Karl Zeman's work in \"Journey to the Beginning of Time\" (1955). Despite a good musical score, the film\u2019s overall quality pales in comparison to classics like \"Equinox\" or \"Planet of the Dinosaurs.\"\n\n\"Mysterious Planet\" was made on a shoestring budget as a home movie, which may be inspiring for aspiring filmmakers despite its numerous imperfections.", "Beyond a shadow of a doubt, \"Mysterious Planet\" stands as one of the worst movies ever made. Nevertheless, it holds a special place in my heart due to its rudimentary special effects and astonishingly poor soundtrack within the first 15 minutes, creating a concoction that is inadvertently hilarious.\n\nThe opening scene set in 'space' is as perplexing as cinematography can get, with bottles of washing-up liquid hurtling past amidst muffled dialogue. Before you can question your own sanity, the credits roll and the disjointed action begins to unfold.\n\nIn addition to a dual-headed plasticine giant snail that menaces our protagonists, the film offers the unique experience of hearing both the original actors' voices and their dubbed counterparts simultaneously. This bizarre detail adds to its unintentional charm.\n\nRegrettably for aficionados of such idiosyncratic cinema, I've only come across a single copy of this film, making it exceedingly unlikely that others will have the opportunity to view it. It is possible that I possess the only existing copy.", "The once silent one-panel cartoon Henry makes a lively entrance at Fleischer Studios, touted as \"The world's funniest human\" in this animated caper.

After leaving his family behind, he reappears to settle his debts, all while trying to keep his distance from them. Enter the charismatic Peter Falk, beloved for his role as Columbo, who pops up in various roles to convince Russ to return home.\n\nThe film boasts an average storyline, but it shines a bit brighter thanks to Peter Falk\u2019s seasoned presence. While William Russ may not be a household name, his acting does the job.\n\nThat said, the predictability of the plot made it feel like a cheese-fest. I could literally predict the lines in the last 20 minutes. A good movie should keep you on your toes, not let you write the script in your head.\n\nIn summary, this film doesn\u2019t hit the mark. If we\u2019re handing out grades, it earns a \"D.\"", "\"Finding John Christmas\" is a film best forgotten, marred by a nonsensical plot, poor dialogue, and disjointed scenes. The acting is lackluster, with no exception even for Peter Falk. Valerie Bertinelli delivers a performance devoid of depth or emotion, as do her co-stars William Russ (Hank) and David Cubitt (Noah). Jennifer Pisana's portrayal of Noah's daughter Soccoro is almost unbearable, both in acting and singing. However, it's hard to blame the actors given the subpar script by Michael J. Murray, which is juvenile at best.\n\nEach year, I eagerly peruse the TV guides, hoping to see classic Christmas and holiday films like \"Miracle on 34th Street,\" Ernst Lubitsch's delightful \"The Shop Around the Corner,\" and the 1951 version of \"Scrooge.\" There are also Frank Capra's classics like \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and \"Meet John Doe.\" Even more contemporary films like \"Home Alone\" and \"Home for the Holidays\" featuring Holly Hunter and a stellar performance by Robert Downey Jr. are worth revisiting.\n\nMy advice to you is to spend your time searching for these timeless films rather than watching \"Finding John Christmas.\" Merry Christmas!", "I usually don't comment on good films, but I can't stay silent about a bad one. Vivah, directed by Sooraj Badjatya, is a prime example of a bad movie. It seems Badjatya, after the success of Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, thought he could profit from making cheesy wedding videos. Vivah is overwhelmingly cheesy, outdoing even the Johars and Chopras.\n\nThroughout the movie, there isn't a single redeeming quality. Aloknath plays a stereotypical father's role, Shahid Kapoor looks unfit, and Amrita Rao's performance is disastrous. The sets are ugly, the costumes are bad, the storyline is hackneyed, and the actors are trying too hard. The background music is cacophonous, and the soundtracks are cheap.\n\nSpoiler alert: as with all of Badjatya's movies, despite a catastrophic event, the film ends on a happy note.", "I wouldn\u2019t label this movie as bad, but it certainly falls short of being good. My expectations were high, especially after watching \"Hum Aapke Hain Kaun,\" which I found to be substantially better. This film feels outdated. Throughout the movie, I anticipated plot twists, yet what I received was a storyline where a girl gets burned and wins her aunt's love.\n\nDespite being engaged, the characters seek permission for every minor action, and their excessive shyness remains even after numerous meetings. I anticipated the aunt to be more ruthless, but her primary role was to complain incessantly.\n\nWe have children too, but we do not constantly watch them with tearing eyes. This movie portrays an idealistic dream: a happy family, a single cruel woman, kind in-laws, and a man deeply in love. In \"Hum Aapke Hain Kaun,\" Anupam Kher played the underprivileged bride\u2019s father, and here the roles are reversed. Somehow, I also expected Mohnish Behl to appear in this film.

Unfortunately, it fell far short. It felt more like a script reading than a fully realized movie, with vulgarity seemingly included just for shock value, and lacking the richness and satisfaction that characterized \"The Tailor of Panama.\" The shortcomings can be attributed to both the screenwriting and directing. I spent the entire film waiting for a standout moment, but it never arrived. There were no laughs, no tears, though one line of dialogue did manage to make me smile. Was it worth the $7 ticket?

After the charm and excitement of \"A New Hope\" and \"The Empire Strikes Back,\" I looked forward to \"Return of the Jedi\" with high hopes. But from the first scene, I was deeply disappointed and angry at George Lucas. He should have been ashamed, but this movie showed he had no shame at all. Episode I would confirm it further -- just mentioning Jar Jar Binks proves the point.\n\nRight from the start at Jabba's palace, this movie felt like a long commercial for as many toy figures as Lucas could fit in \u2013 the pig-like guards, the sidekick with the head-tails, Jabba's pet, the dancers, the monsters, and more. Then there were the cute, marketable Ewoks and the various Rebel aliens. Each one got just enough screen time to make kids want the toys. The way Lucas targeted kids for profit was sickening.\n\nLucas didn't even come up with a new plot \u2013 he just reused the Death Star from \"A New Hope\" and added cheap sentiment. It felt like a huge insult to his fans. It seemed like Lucas took pleasure in creating terrible content because he knew fans would still come, and kids would beg their parents for the toys, making him richer.\n\nThere might have been a few good moments in this disappointment. I think Harrison Ford did his best to stay afloat. But any small bright spots were buried under the overwhelming commercialism that Lucas embraced just for profit.", "Despite a talented cast, this routine tale of a secretary murdered by her married lover falls flat. The story raises more questions than it answers, offering only the prosecution's perspective. Aimed at those who revel in tales of male villainy, it portrays an innocent woman ensnared in an affair with a high-profile attorney. Would the tragic events have unfolded if she hadn't been involved with a married man? You won't miss much by stepping away during this predictable narrative.", "This film was disjointed, incoherent, and felt overly forced. It also presented a deeply negative and mean-spirited depiction of women.

They prefer she marry a dull man their own age who has feelings for her. Nevertheless, she is so happy with her energetic younger partner that you root for them to make it. Eventually, she decides to marry him. However, her manipulative girlfriend, with help from the indecisive one, devises a plan to make her believe the young man is unfaithful. The plan succeeds, leading to a fight, and he tragically dies when he runs out and is hit by a truck (hence, the film\u2019s title). By this point, two-thirds into the movie, our protagonist, who is a headmistress overseeing a school for girls, is revealed to be pregnant \u2013 apparently having neglected birth control.\n\nShe breaks ties with her girlfriends due to their lack of support and, feeling alone and desperate, decides to marry the boring man. Incidentally, he is a minister, whom she had previously asked to officiate her wedding to the young man (charming, right?). Now, she proposes to the minister, who inexplicably has no objections to this sudden change. At the altar, her girlfriends intervene and take her home, barely admitting their major role in her true love\u2019s demise. She has the baby, and in the final scene, they leave the infant in a crib inside her house while they lounge on the porch, drinking, smoking, and acting self-satisfied. It really is that bad. I haven\u2019t even mentioned the convoluted subplot involving a cancer scare and the melodramatic, unnecessary lesbian scene.", "This film feels like a desperate cash grab, riding on the coattails of Sex and the City and Four Weddings and a Funeral. They might have done better at the box office if they'd named it Sex at a Funeral.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie flounders and can't find its footing. The characters spout unnaturally sharp dialogue, but their actions are far from believable. Scenes string together with arbitrary nonsense just to push along a flimsy plot, making the whole thing feel exhaustingly fake.<br /><br />Andie MacDowell gives her all, truly pouring her heart into her performance. However, Imelda Staunton effortlessly steals the spotlight as a police detective (isn't there usually a height requirement?). Staunton is impeccable in every scene. If only we could say the same for the writer-director.<br /><br />If Notting Hill's phoniness irritated you, steer clear of this one. It's faux pas on a platter.", "This film is easily among the worst I've ever seen. Picture this: Kate shows up, Jed is surrounded by a group of guys, and they all start clapping. It's painfully clich\u00e9, straight out of Hollywood's playbook. Then there's a laughable scene where Kate strokes the pavement as if she's examining its texture\u2014completely baffling. \n\nAndie's acting is abysmal; I couldn't connect with her or feel any genuine chemistry. On the flip side, the two other female characters were stellar and completely outshone Andie. The movie teeters on the edge of campiness, and while I typically enjoy that genre, I just couldn't get into this one. The film is riddled with implausible scenarios, and Andie's lackluster performance only drags it down further. And oh, don't get me started on her appearance. It's like Lancome applied her makeup with a putty knife\u2014she looks glamorous in commercials, but it just doesn't translate on screen.", "The movie starts off poorly, with three women behaving like immature adolescents, giggling with their gin, smoking endless cigarettes, and awarding a caramel chocolate treat to whoever tells the best story about men. It takes a turn for the worse when Andie's character, the headmistress of an English school, falls in love with a young organ player who was once her student at the age of 14. Her malicious girlfriend ruins their relationship. After that, the plot devolves into an unwatchable mess: Andie's character forgives her friend, has the organ player's child, and the three women return to their routine of drinking gin and smoking cigarettes. In a futile attempt at character development, Andie's character throws the caramel chocolates into the street. How disappointing.", "This film was a disappointment. Andie MacDowell's performance was lacking; her acting was so stiff that it made a rocking horse seem expressive. Her role in \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\" was similarly agonizing. The movie also perpetuates a cliched image of England, filled with picturesque cottages and village greens. The school in the film, for instance, looks unrealistically magical\u2014more like Hogwarts than any real school. The quaint police station seemed like a set from \"Heartbeat,\" a saccharine British series from the '60s.\n\nThe film struggled to decide whether it wanted to be a comedy or a serious look into the complexities of women's friendships. If it had committed to being a comedy, perhaps the graveyard sex scenes and the absurd wedding disruption might have worked\u2014just barely. Unfortunately, these scenes clashed with the tragic elements in the second half. It also seemed unrealistic that Kate would ever forgive Molly for her atrocious behavior.\n\nLastly, it's puzzling why talented actresses like Imelda Staunton and Anna Chancellor participated in this project. MacDowell would be better suited for commercial work, such as promoting skincare products.", "I watched this on IFC yesterday and can't believe the positive reviews. Am I the only one who found the \"ladies\" completely unbelievable? Kate tells Jed she could get fired because she's supposed to be a pillar of the community, then sleeps with him. Then they suddenly decide they're in love? She's so devastated over his death that she doesn't go to his funeral or tell his family the \"good news.\" Also, how did an American become the headmistress of a very proper British school? Janine should have been kicked off the force for her abuse of power, but nothing happens. She ends up with a con she brought in for questioning. And let's not even get started on Molly.\n\nAs for the guilt Janine and Molly feel over Jed, it's his own fault he got run over. Where's the guilt over Gerald, who gets puked on? I wish I could do the same to the people who made this \"movie.\"", "I initially thought it was a movie set in New York\u2014wrong! It's actually set in the quaint British countryside.\n\nI assumed it was a comedy\u2014wrong again! It's a drama. Well, at least until the last third, when the story becomes utterly \"abracadabrantesque,\" a term used during a French presidential mandate to describe something close to nonsense, even if the intentions aim to evoke sincere feelings.\n\nSo, what\u2019s worth noting? Perhaps the dynamic duo of actresses. Yes, I recognize there are three friends, but the redheaded policewoman seemed almost invisible to me. The tall doctor impresses with her toughness, and McDowell delivers her usual fine acting\u2014delicate, soft, and nearly mute. This gentleness intrigues me because it's a recurring theme with other fine artists and directors too. In McDowell's case, she consistently plays a character defined by her emotions and values, living endless different stories. I still struggle to distinguish between the artist and their work.\n\nAnother positive aspect of this film is its feminine touch and the varied perspectives it offers. Each woman has her own way of living, even though they are all single. It's enlightening to see how a single reality can be perceived in so many diverse ways.\n\nIn the end, the movie is fairly enjoyable, but the conclusion diminishes the desire for a rewatch.", "Was this supposed to be a comedy or a serious drama? The movie begins with light-hearted banter among three women, then shifts to conflict when one meets a man. That's fine. There are some funny moments. Fine. But when the plot gets darker, I started to wonder if I misunderstood the beginning. It keeps going like this until it tries to return to the light-hearted tone at the end. By then, it's too late. It's hard to believe the women would still be talking to each other, and the ending is unconvincing. This is a clear example of how not to make movies. It's surprising the producers thought it would work, and the box office failure proved it. I hadn't heard of this film until this weekend, four years after its release.", "Andie McDowell shines as a beautiful woman in her 40s who, after a late start in serious relationships, finds herself involved with a much younger man. This newfound romance causes a rift with her two longtime best friends.\n\nBelieving the young man to be a gigolo or gold-digger, the friends are determined to end the \"silly relationship.\" They go to great lengths to \"help\" their friend, whom they see as being manipulated by this supposed gigolo.\n\nThe resulting situations are utterly ridiculous and unrealistic. Such far-fetched scenes undermine what could have been a sweet love story. Instead, viewers are likely to find themselves shaking their heads in disbelief because such events simply don't happen. \n\nWithout spoiling the ending, I advise viewers not to set high expectations for this film, as many, including myself, will likely be disappointed. On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate this movie a weak 4. There is much better material out there, and this one isn\u2019t worth your time.", "SPOILER: The young lover, Jed, is kicked out by the spinster, Kate (Andie McDowell), because she mistakenly believes Jed is having an affair with one of her two gossipy friends. Kate thought she caught them red-handed. She throws Jed's shoes out the door. Jed hesitantly leaves, sits in the middle of the road to put his shoes on, and then gets hit by a truck and dies (\"Crushed,\" one meaning of the title).\n\n\"And then he gets run over by a truck.\" Can you believe a screenwriter actually included this plot twist? Up to that point, it\u2019s a comedy aiming for a lighthearted feel but falls flat. Everyone except Jed is just irritating. Then Jed gets killed, everyone mourns, and by the end, the women learn to love and support each other instead of tearing each other down. I rate it 2 \"ugh\"s.", "The most disappointing thing about \"Crush\" isn't the subpar acting or the almost non-existent plot. It's not even the mediocre camerawork.\n\nNo, what really gets to you are the few moments of brilliance that give you hope there might be more.\n\nUnfortunately, these moments are too few and far between. If you enjoy violin music and melodramatic scenes of women over 40 crying, hugging, and discussing babies and marriage, then you might find it worthwhile.\n\nHowever, these elements didn't appeal to me, making my experience quite unpleasant. The occasional clever joke can't make up for the rest.\n\nOverall, I'd rate it 4/10. It's guilty of wasting my time.", "It\u2019s not a 'woman film' but a film for a general audience. It's one of the worst films ever created by a male director about women. Director Adam McKay clearly lacks understanding of women. The film demonstrates poor taste, reminiscent of American Pie's humor with a crude and nonsensical storyline and poorly developed characters. Vulgar fantasies are brought to life on screen, resulting in an insulting and definitely unfunny movie. I am perplexed as to why three talented actresses agreed to participate in it.", "As a single woman over 40, I found this film extremely insulting and demeaning to women in my age group, as well as to women of all ages. It was a pathetic attempt by a man to write and direct a \"chick flick,\" and it failed miserably. Andy McDowell, who isn't a strong actress to begin with, had no chance due to the nonexistent plot. There was no character development, no reason to feel sympathy or empathy towards any of the characters, and no effort to make the film realistic or believable. Additionally, the clich\u00e9 of an attractive straight woman suddenly deciding to explore lesbianism was utterly ridiculous.\n\nI not only want my money back for the DVD rental but also wish I could get back those 112 minutes of my life. What a ripoff.", "I was initially thrilled by the premise of this film\u2014the intricate friendship of three women disrupted when one falls for a younger man. Intriguing, right?\n\nWell, not so much. Unfortunately, the women are exaggerated caricatures, depicted as unsupportive and constantly scheming against each other. Despite my admiration for Anna Chancellor and Imelda Staunton, even their talent couldn't salvage a script that awkwardly blends slapstick and screwball comedy. This approach falls flat, especially in the claustrophobic setting of a small town.\n\nFor characters meant to be intelligent, they spend an inordinate amount of time lamenting the absence of men, sex, and passion in their lives. Given a better script and more genuine tension, the film could have been so much more. Instead, the half-baked lesbian subplot goes nowhere, and the portrayal of the women as heavy smokers and drinkers, even in implausible situations like during a baby scene, strains credulity. It's frustrating to see characters in their forties depicted so unrealistically\u2014\"Screw the baby, gimme a cigarette!\" Really?\n\nAll in all, this movie is a disappointing waste of potential. I'd give it a 4 out of 10.", "\"The Crush\" is a pretty enjoyable rom-com about a group of 40-something friends, kind of like a British version of \"Sex and the City\" for the first two-thirds. \n\nI really liked the twist with the young hunk's character\u2014though we don't get much backstory or see enough of Kenny Doughty (who's definitely worth more screen time).\n\nThere's a big focus on the young man/older woman dynamic, way more than we've seen with older guy/younger girl in movies like \"Sabrina\" (I don't like either version) or even the real-life couples like Douglas/Zeta-Jones or Dion and her mentor.\n\nAndie MacDowell plays an ex-pat, surrounded by familiar faces from British dramas and comedies, like the sharp-tongued Anna Chancellor.\n\nThe plot gets kinda wild towards the end, and everything wraps up in a deus ex machina style. It wasn't until the credits rolled that I figured out what felt off. Just like \"Sex and the City,\" the writer/director is a guy\u2014in this case, Scot John McKay in his debut. I suspect he originally wanted to write about three gay men dealing with coming out and their relationships at work (the characters are a school principal, a cop, and a doctor). That would've been a more interesting film, to be honest. The movie's working title was \"The Sad F*cker's Club,\" which would have made its similarities with \"Broken Hearts Club\" even more obvious.\n\n(originally written 4/6/2002)", "This movie had the potential to be enjoyable if it had delved into more intriguing aspects rather than just the superficial elements of a lesbian relationship. If the intention was merely to depict that, the plot is rather predictable. Additionally, the two lead actresses bear a striking resemblance to the Russian musical duo t.A.T.u., which does not seem to be a coincidence. This lack of originality implies that the filmmakers relied on an already popular group to attract attention.\n\nThe supporting cast appears to lack clear purpose within the story. Although many of them are well-known in Romania, some are not even professional actors, such as Mihaela R\u0103dulescu. In summary, the film seems to be a combination of a \"girl band\" concept akin to t.A.T.u., actors seeking publicity, a nonexistent plot, and gratuitous use of offensive language meant to shock the audience. The result is a disappointing film titled \"Love Sick.\" It's unfortunate because the initial concept had promise. Additionally, refraining from commenting on the title is challenging due to its lack of fittingness.", "***LIGHT SPOILER ALERT*** The storyline is intriguing, and those familiar with the novel might anticipate a profound and intense film that explores intriguing and underrepresented human connections.\n\nWhile the script and direction make an effort to achieve this, the lead actors unfortunately fall short. Maria's performance is notably lackluster, devoid of emotion, and her most intense scenes come off as almost laughable. She appears to be uneasy in front of the camera, although she does deliver one genuinely moving scene towards the end when her character is dumped by her girlfriend.\n\nIoana's performance fares even worse; she appears tense and unnatural throughout. Maria at least has some semblance of attitude, albeit artificially exaggerated, which lends her character some credibility. However, Ioana's character lacks depth and backstory. There's no explanation of her origins, how she became involved in the lesbian relationship, or how the relationship developed. We get only sporadic glimpses of her parents, and their relationship appears to just 'exist' without any beginning - merely content and conclusion. Similar to Maria, Ioana has only one truly touching scene, where she breaks up with Maria's character, Kiki.\n\nTudor, alongside the commendable performance of the landlady, is the only actor who displays notable talent. He embodies his character well, only faltering once or twice, such as during the meal scene with his parents, where his performance is unnecessarily overt.\n\nWhile I appreciate the story and Tudor Chirila's satisfactory performance, as well as the landlady's convincing acting and Puya's stylish delivery of his brief lines, these positives are insufficient to salvage the film. It's unfortunate, as the setting had immense potential and Romanian cinema could have benefitted from a film tackling this theme.\n\nIronically, the incestuous relationship between the brother and sister seems more credible than the poorly developed and emotionally hollow lesbian relationship between Maria and Ioana. Regrettably, I feel my money was wasted on a ticket when I would have been better off watching it at home.", "This movie exploits controversial themes like incest and lesbianism just to attract attention. The dialogues are dreadful, and the \"sex scenes\" lack any sensuality. The acting and dialogue are more appropriate for high-school productions, despite the adult subject matter. It is a gutless and shallow film that could have been significantly improved with a coherent story and more drama. The excessive use of inner monologues cheapens it further. Overall, it's an embarrassment for Romanian cinema and mature viewers. Limited resources are no excuse for a flop like this. And please, cast real actors instead of recycling musicians like Tudor Chirila, who clearly can't act!", "I found myself less enchanted by \"Love Sick\" than I initially anticipated. The film delves into the complex sexual relationships between Alex, Kiki, and Sandu, capturing a love triangle steeped in intensity, frustration, and jealousy. In the end, Alex comes to the realization that their intertwined lives do not have a future, leading to a sad conclusion.\n\nDirector Tudor Giurgiu attended a screening at AMC theater on Sunday, August 10, 2006, at 12:00 PM, sharing his vision with the audience. He explained that the film aimed to portray the intricate nature of Romanian sexual relationships.\n\nFrom my perspective, complicated sexual relationships are not unique to Romania; they exist everywhere. The storyline involving Alex, Kiki, and Kiki's brother Sandu seemed like an ordinary neighborhood tale to me.\n\nThere are two main reasons why the film did not resonate with me. Firstly, the film did not adequately explain how Alex and Kiki's love began. It felt abrupt and unconvincing, as if they fell in love merely because Alex moved into Kiki's building. It requires too much imagination to piece together the fragmented story. Secondly, there were no intimate scenes between Alex and Kiki, which left me wanting more insight into their relationship. However, the film did have some redeeming moments. The ear-piercing scene was particularly poignant, as it symbolized Alex's willingness to endure pain for Kiki's love. Additionally, the scene where they lie on a soccer field and express their love was sincere and passionate, offering a glimpse into the depth of their feelings.", "I didn't enjoy \"Love Sick\" as much as I expected. The film explores the intense, frustrating, and jealous sexual relationships between Alex, Kik, and Sandu, culminating in Alex's realization that their relationship has no future, leading to a sad ending.\n\nDirector Tudor Giurgiu attended a screening at AMC Theatre on 08/10/06 and explained that the film aims to depict the complexities of Romanian sexual relationships.\n\nI found the portrayal of sexual life to be universally complicated and unremarkable. The relationships between Alex, Kik, and Sandu felt like a typical neighborhood story.\n\nThe film fell short for two main reasons: it didn't convincingly show how Alex and Kik's relationship began, and it lacked a key scene depicting their sexual intimacy, which I anticipated. Despite these flaws, the ear-piercing scene and the heartfelt conversation on the soccer field were noteworthy and added depth to their love story.", "Given the significant and seemingly effective promotional campaign for this movie, I anticipated it would live up to the hype. However, it disappoints from the very start. The opening scene, where the two brothers share a supposedly \"sensual\" moment in bed, sets the tone for a rapid decline. There is nothing engaging or thought-provoking in the entire plot. The acting is generally poor, with only a few minor exceptions, and feels highly contrived.\n\nWhile incest and lesbianism could be intriguing themes, the script fails to explore either with any real depth. If the filmmakers claim they were aiming for subtlety, it would be laughable unless they equate subtlety with superficiality. Viewers hoping for any compelling scenes will be let down, a factor that might have partially redeemed the movie but ultimately doesn't.\n\nFor those curious enough to watch, you'll find yourself wasting approximately 90 minutes of your life, just as I did. Many more criticisms could be shared, but I'll leave it to you to experience the disappointment firsthand.", "Indeed, it had the potential to be a good movie. Featuring a love biangle\u2014apologies for the creative liberty, as it is not quite a triangle\u2014it presents an interesting story that, regrettably, is poorly told. The cinematography fluctuates between awkward and acceptable, giving the impression of a crowded and short-sighted visual presentation. The audio, as is often the case with Romanian films, requires more meticulous attention. Additionally, the lighting and color filters are sometimes inappropriately selected. The soundtrack is brief and fails to support the narrative effectively. Regarding the acting, it is unfortunate to note that the landlady's performance is the most commendable. The remaining cast members deliver immature performances that fail to engage the audience convincingly. The acting is overly poetic when a realistic approach is needed and vice versa. This film, ostensibly intended for an adult audience, is conveyed as if by children. Only consider watching if exceedingly curious.", "Stan Lathan's \"Beat Street\" presents a more authentic and layered portrayal than \"Breakdance,\" but it remains rather unremarkable. This film also profits from the 'breakdancing' trend; however, it offers some entertainment through its plot, which follows three young friends and a younger brother growing up in Queens, New York. Each character showcases a unique talent: one is a hustler, another a DJ, a third an artist creating 'burners,' and the youngest, Lee, is a talented hip-hop dancer.\n\nDespite this, Lathan struggles to engage the audience with the story, and the young cast members also have difficulty connecting with their characters. Consequently, the film relies heavily on its energetic music and impressive dance sequences to maintain interest.\n\nThe choreography is precise and vibrant in both club and street settings, but this is not enough to elevate \"Beat Street\" significantly. Ultimately, the film falls short, especially towards the end, despite briefly hinting at the potential to become more engaging.\n\nReviewed on Sunday, August 25, 1996 - Video.", "This film attempts to depict a group of high school teenagers heavily involved in the hip-hop culture, including break dancing, graffiti, and aspiring to become DJs at the Roxy nightclub. However, the drama is painfully obvious and lacks any subtlety, leaving me so disinterested I could hardly remember the details. Even fans of the music genre agree that the acting is dismal, and the film's attempt at drama falls flat. \n\nWe're meant to perceive these teenagers as likable and endearing, but instead, they come off as dull and uninspiring. Ramon, in particular, was a character I found especially irritating. His graffiti on subway trains is portrayed as admirable, which I find perplexing since it constitutes defacing public property. Additionally, these supposedly \"great\" kids illegally tap into the city's electricity to host a dance party in an abandoned building. We're expected to see these lawbreakers as charming and fun, but I couldn't find them anything but irresponsible.\n\nEven if I could overlook these issues, the music was a major problem for me. I have a strong aversion to hip-hop, and the songs in the movie were mediocre at best. They were incessantly playing, to the point where I started fast-forwarding through many of the endless musical numbers. Without the music, the film would probably be a mere 30 minutes long. \n\nThere are a few creative scenes, like a subway dance fight, a genuinely funny Santa number, and the climactic show at the Roxy. If you're a hip-hop enthusiast, this might be your kind of movie. However, if you're seeking quality drama, look elsewhere. Additionally, how this movie received a PG rating is beyond me, given the substantial amount of swearing throughout.", "Wild Style and Style Wars represent original Hip Hop, whereas Beat Street, despite featuring many early Hip Hop artists, lacks authenticity. It's overproduced and influenced by Hollywood. Instead, seek out the first two movies for a gritty portrayal of life in the ghetto.\n\nAlthough Beat Street's rating is low, its positive reviews stem from the music and dancing, despite poor story, acting, dialogue, and direction. Personally, I enjoy the dancing but dislike the movie's electro beats, which I felt marked the decline of Hip Hop until new artists emerged around '86.\n\nIn contrast, Wild Style's music remains great and authentic, despite a minimal story. Opinions vary, but for me, Beat Street fails except for the break dancing and some music, so I rate it 4 out of 10.", "I found myself unable to tolerate watching \"Happy Days\" once Chachi joined the cast, so I was immediately concerned when the most notable scene in this film featured Scott Baio\u2014a skateboard chase, no less. Jodie Foster, in her first mature role, delivers her character with her customary professionalism, but this still does not redeem the film from being an insipid waste of time. The two hours I invested in watching it are hours I shall never recover. The film is devoid of noteworthy characters, features an implausible storyline, suffers from questionable editing, and exhibits horrendous cinematography. Most critically, it failed to engage me at any level. The narrative, concerning California teenagers in the 1970s, depicts these young people living in despair and their parents portrayed as fools. I would strongly advise against wasting your time on this inferior cinematic endeavor.", "Awful movie with random Ramones cameos. It\u2019s your typical cheesy 70s/80s comedy about the cool kids taking over the school with some silly scheme. The plot\u2019s about a girl who loves the Ramones and a school trying to fight its strict administration. Seriously, skip this one and watch something like Wild Zero with Guitar Wolf if you\u2019re looking for an entertaining B movie. The acting, writing, and plot are all terrible. The only reason the Ramones are involved is probably because they needed money. This movie sucks.", "Get ready for a wild ride with this movie\u2014a 90-minute Ramones concert punctuated by bouts of pure absurdity and mind-numbing tedium. Seriously, what kind of high school is this?\n\nIf you're not a die-hard Ramones fan, heed my warning: DO NOT, and I repeat, DO NOT waste your time like I did. This film is completely unwatchable from beginning to end. It deserves the title \"Ramone Fever,\" because everyone seems obsessed with them in this flick. Don\u2019t expect a plot\u2014there\u2019s none to be found. When it comes to teen comedies, this one is scraping the absolute bottom of the barrel.", "I awarded this film two stars solely due to Dominic Monaghan's commendable effort in his acting. Unfortunately, the remainder of the film exhibits an extreme lack of professionalism. The direction of this film was executed very poorly. The director should seriously reconsider her career choices and perhaps dedicate time to watching a few films to improve her skills. Despite Dominic Monaghan's esteemed reputation as an actor, his involvement in a film of this quality detracts from his credibility. The individual portraying Jack's best friend demonstrated a lack of suitability for appearing on screen. Although I did not have high expectations for such a modest production, a greater investment of time and effort into developing the characters and their environment was necessary. I strongly advise against spending your time or money on this film, as it will undoubtedly leave you disappointed.", "I eagerly seized the opportunity to watch this film unedited and without interruptions, recalling the acclaim it had received. However, whenever the movie seemed poised to become truly terrifying, it retreated and diverted its focus. The persistent sound of dripping water throughout the house, the ominous black rain, prophetic dreams, and wrong turns through raw sewage were all abandoned before they could culminate in a genuine fright.\n\nWhat a disappointment it turned out to be. Chamberlain's nearly expressionless face conveyed little more than confused disbelief, a sentiment I found myself sharing as the film progressed. What could have been eerie Aboriginal chanting and instrumental background music instead became a cacophony seemingly intended to force terror upon the audience. Concepts such as modern individuals embodying ancient gods, the Aboriginal belief that red-haired white men were the first priests, and many other intriguing ideas were presented more like a mundane checklist than an invitation to explore another dimension (the Dream Time).\n\n[SPOILER] In the final scene, the director's intent was unclear. Is there a big wave? So what? How big is it? A tsunami? Sure, that's devastating but not apocalyptic. Is it the end of the world, from a wave? The last wave? It would have to be an extraordinarily massive wave. Why? Was the world portrayed as such a terrible place? It didn't seem that awful in this film. In fact, I doubted the wave even happened since the shadow cast on Burton\u2019s face by the wave disappeared. Was it only Burton's personal apocalypse? That happens every day to people who experience a mental breakdown. It held no interest if it was solely his plight.\n\nThe most chilling scene, and the one that best showcases Weir's potential, occurs in Charlie's apartment where Burton confronts the old man for frightening his wife. Charlie repeatedly asks, \"Who are you?\" and the question becomes increasingly unsettling. Regrettably, the rest of the film fails to follow this promising lead.", "Get ready for a thrilling ride! The perfect murder plot unravels in spectacular fashion when a wife (played by the brilliant Mary Ellen Trainor, who was once married to acclaimed director Robert Zemeckis, who directs this episode) takes out her husband with a poker. Just as she's about to move the body, an unexpected visitor arrives \u2013 an escaped lunatic dressed as Santa Claus (portrayed by the wickedly grotesque Larry Drake). \n\nIn a heart-pounding race against time, the wife must fend off this deranged Santa while figuring out how to conceal her husband's corpse. She seizes an opportunity to frame the killer by using an ax, nearly losing her head several times in the process! The twisted Santa locks her in a closet and goes after her daughter, igniting an electrifying struggle as she desperately tries to break free and save her child.\n\nThis episode of TALES FROM THE CRYPT delivers non-stop suspense, blending the classic \"Santa kills\" trope with a familiar tale of marital betrayal. Mary Ellen Trainor\u2019s riveting performance anchors a plot that's a pulse-quickening ride, even if it treads some well-worn paths. Though it may not be the most groundbreaking story, its sheer intensity makes it a standout moment of dark, gleeful terror!", "That's not the sound of bees; it's the effect induced by watching this extremely long, extremely boring, badly acted movie. How I ever made it through all 3 1/2 hours without falling asleep, I'll never know. The plot is simple: three thoroughly unlikable morons talk about sex for 3 1/2 hours. And you thought Rohmer was deadly? This is even worse, if that's possible. I must really be a masochist to watch this entire movie without turning it off or losing my sanity.", "Iberia is nice to watch on TV, but why see it on the big screen? It features a lot of dance and music. If you're a fan of classical music or modern dance, it might be the perfect movie for you. Otherwise, an hour and a half can feel too long. For skillful dancing on the big screen, Bollywood movies are a better choice as they excel at combining breathtaking dancing with lengthy films. Director Carlos Saura has a wealth of experience in filming dance, and it shows at times. However, for a movie that's an hour and a half long, it should be consistently engaging. While there are many forms of art, not all are larger than life, and this film doesn't quite reach that level.", "I am astonished that reviewers enjoyed this movie. The plot is convoluted and difficult to follow. The characters lack depth and are unconvincing. Michael Bowen spends most of the film observing other characters and repeatedly misinterpreting their actions. None of the characters possess any likable qualities or unique traits. This work lacks edginess, imagination, irony, and cleverness. Its tedious nature makes it unsurprising that it did not receive a theatrical release. The fact that \"This Network\" airs it only lowers the quality of that channel. I highly recommend switching to a rerun of \"Garden Smart\" on PBS, or even watching an informative show, if you come across this movie late at night. If you find it on daytime television, consider taking a long walk instead. Even if you walk in smog, it will be more enjoyable than enduring this chaotic mess. Life is too short to waste on a movie this long and unengaging.", "This is a terrible movie with a bad script, poor direction, and a nonsensical ending. The performances are mostly bad, except for Clancy Brown, who is sadly underused, and Michael Pollard. Watching this movie felt like torture--you endure it only to balance out your bad movie experiences and hope for a good one later.\n\nThe movie shows a father and son who don't look related at all. The male lead's character is poorly written and lacks charisma. The plot is predictable, and the actions of the female lead and her cop brother make no sense. A major action by her at the end doesn\u2019t make sense in the story.", "Once regarded as a skilled director, Burt Kennedy's latest effort is an unmitigated disaster that fails on almost every level. This film isn't just cheap\u2014it epitomizes cheapness, with battle scenes shamelessly recycled from the far superior 1955 classic \"The Last Command.\" Shockingly, these 32-year-old snippets look more modern than anything newly filmed for this production. The scant action scenes Kennedy manages to shoot are chaotic and poorly executed, much like the rest of this disjointed mess. The film exudes the amateurish vibe of a low-budget student project, and it trudges along with the sluggish pace of thick molasses.\n\nThe acting here ranges from outrageously overdone to virtually lifeless, with only Raul Julia managing to rise above the mediocrity pervading his co-stars' performances. Historical inaccuracies abound, adding yet another layer of frustration. And if you thought it couldn't get worse, the lengthy runtime will make you wish for a swift conclusion\u2014three excruciating hours instead of a more mercifully brief bore-fest.\n\nFor a gripping and well-crafted story of the Alamo, turn to John Wayne's 1960 version or the very film this one cannibalizes. It's incomprehensible how it took six producers to generate something so profoundly flawed. Spare yourself the pain\u2014skip this one.", "This James Arness western might've aimed high, but it spectacularly missed the mark as the worst Alamo film ever! The storyline? A disaster, riddled with inaccuracies and outright fabrications. Continuity? Completely abandoned. Did anyone notice the cannon sequence? The Mexicans absurdly fire cannons clogged with mud and ramrods. Seriously? And let's not forget Brian Keith's outlandish hat\u2014what was the costumer thinking? Or were they even there?", "This movie misses the mark on multiple levels. Instead of delivering a credible portrayal of the Alamo, it falls into the trap of perpetuating myths rather than presenting historical truths. The production quality is subpar, making it seem like a last-resort job opportunity for actors who might otherwise be relegated to game shows.\n\nThe most glaring issue is the casting. Knowing the ages and personalities of the real Alamo figures, the choice of older TV actors destroys any semblance of authenticity. As a native Texan familiar with both the mythology and the history, I can appreciate a well-made rendition from either angle\u2014though I lean toward historical accuracy. Unfortunately, this film fails to offer even a moment of enjoyment.\n\nIn comparison, John Wayne's and Fess Parker's versions, though not without their faults, at least brought the story to life. This iteration, however, is a dull and disappointing mess. Do yourself a favor and skip it.", "Despite its slow pace and occasional inaccuracies, this account of the famed and heroic siege of the Alamo during the Texas fight for independence from Mexico remains captivating. James Arness stars as the rugged Jim Bowie, with Brian Keith as the legendary Davy Crockett, and Alec Baldwin as the determined Col. Travis. Raul Julia masterfully portrays General Santa Anna. This made-for-TV project also features David Ogden Stiers, Kathleen York, and Jim Metzler, all supported by Peter Bernstein's stirring original music.", "The Alamo: Thirteen Days to Glory is a total letdown. The acting is painfully bad, the patriotism feels over the top, and the historical inaccuracies would drive any historian crazy. While there are a few decent scenes, they\u2019re not enough to hold your attention through the overly lengthy runtime. Rating: * out of **********.", "Norman Maclean's story is a masterpiece, while Redford's adaptation falls flat. He adds uninspired scenes of the Maclean brothers going over a waterfall and double-dating in a shabby bar, which are not present in the original story. Brad Pitt's attempt to portray the charismatic Paul Maclean, a virtuoso outdoorsman, comes off as either laughable or disheartening, depending on your attachment to the original narrative. Some fly casting scenes are visually stunning. Additionally, Tom Skerritt as the father and Craig Sheffer as Norman are robust and manly, reflecting traditional expectations of men. Unfortunately, none of the women leave a memorable impression in the film, which is a pity, since Maclean adored the women in his story and expressed this sentiment in a clear, even poetic manner.", "The film's only redeeming quality is its stunning scenery. Otherwise, it was an excruciatingly long and tedious experience. The minister's credibility should have been questioned the moment his son, Paul, abandoned everything he preached. As someone supposedly from a Presbyterian background, it's jarring how frequently the characters blaspheme. Paul (Brad Pitt) should have been swept away by the river at the very start, sparing us his insufferable, self-centered story. The narrative of Norm becoming a teacher and Paul a compulsive gambler whom Norm fails to save is painfully dull. The most intriguing scene, where Paul stands up against the prejudiced whites for his Native American girlfriend, had potential but was sorely underdeveloped. Instead, we're left with a lethargic tale of two minister's sons: Norm, who pursues a lackluster relationship, and Paul, who wastes time concocting silly stories and tying flies. I\u2019d prefer to watch an actual fishing show over enduring this film ever again.", "... It's not advisable to live in Montana, particularly not at the end of the 19th century.\n\n\"A River Runs Through It\" is certainly a well-crafted movie from a cinematic standpoint, showcasing breathtaking landscapes and strong performances by Robert Redford.\n\nHowever, the story is weak, if it can even be called a story.\n\nI felt sorry for the narrator/author, who comes across as dry and narrow-minded, much like his father, a preacher. He is propelled by circumstances rather than taking charge of his own life, watching helplessly as his brother, also trapped in the confines of their small town, loses his way. The author never truly understands his brother's motivations, but at least he realizes that he himself lacks any sense of humor or fun. For him, life revolves around fly-fishing, an activity he pursues even into old age, adhering to his father's approach.\n\nThe ending is unsurprising and predictable from the outset.\n\nDefinitely not a must-see (3/10).", "I believe a good film usually has an engaging plot. Unfortunately, this particular film seemed to be missing one, and I think it could have been more effective with a stronger storyline. It didn't help that it felt like it dragged on forever; I found myself eagerly waiting for it to end. Interestingly, it was only 123 minutes long, but it felt much longer to me. In addition to the lack of plot, the film also didn't have much notable conflict. \n\nIt's certainly not the worst movie I've seen, but it used to hold that spot for me until I watched \"The Fast And The Furious\". So, don't get the impression that my review comes from someone who just wants non-stop action. In fact, I generally don't enjoy most action films out today; this movie just felt like it was at the opposite end of the spectrum where not much happens. \n\nOn the bright side, the scenery and costumes were quite nice!", "This film boasts stunning visuals, but sadly lacks a cohesive storyline. For a plot to exist, there needs to be conflict, and this movie has none. It dedicates two hours to showcasing beautiful scenes without incorporating any significant action. While it aims for an artistic approach, it misses the essential elements of good storytelling.\n\nHowever, if you're a fan of Montana's landscapes and enjoy fly fishing, you'll appreciate the movie's aesthetic. Just be aware that it doesn't offer much in terms of narrative.", "This movie boasts stunning scenery but lacks a plot. Without conflict, it spends two hours painting a beautiful picture without any real activity. It tries to be artistic but neglects storytelling fundamentals. If you love Montana scenery and fly fishing, you'll find some value\u2014just don't expect a story. There isn't one.", "I gave this movie a 1, which is the rating I reserve for films that make me either walk out or fall asleep. In this case, I fell asleep 10 minutes before it ended, feeling extremely bored and completely uninterested in what happened next.", "Mann captures the essence of the Alberta Rocky Mountains exquisitely through his photography, while Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan deliver consistently delightful performances.\n\nHowever, Hollywood's portrayal leaves much to be desired. The depiction of a Mountie advising the citizens of Dawson City, Yukon, to elect a marshal and take the law into their own hands, followed by gunfighters clashing in the streets for control, is highly inaccurate. \n\nSuch events never transpired on the Canadian side of the border during the Klondike gold rush. It appears that Mr. Mann and his team have conflated Dawson City with Deadwood, thereby confusing the Canadian North with the American Wild West.\n\nCanadian viewers should be prepared for an experience akin to the campy entertainment of \"Reefer Madness,\" either finding humor in the absurdity of the plot or shaking their heads in disbelief.", "This action Western, set in the scenic Northwest and starring James Stewart, features great scenery, costumes, and adventure. Stewart plays a wealthy cattleman up against a crooked government.\n\nHowever, Stewart's character is a stereotypical Hollywood cynic with few redeeming qualities, though he shows kindness to his partners, lending him some credibility. His otherwise piggish behavior makes it hard to care for him. \n\nNonetheless, the minor characters, including Walter Brennan, Royal Dano, and Harry Morgan, are quite enjoyable and make the film worth watching.", "This is the worst movie sequel ever. It's nonsensical, with the killer still murdering for fun\u2014this time targeting people making a movie about the first film. It's utterly foolish.\n\nAvoid watching it if you value your time. You'll be left questioning the director's decisions. It fails to blend horror, action, and crime as the original did.\n\nDon't let children or teenagers watch it. It has a negative impact on viewers.", "Ah, Channel 5 of local Mexican TV! Every day, at 2:00 a.m., they air classic Horror movies from the 70's to early 2000's. Yesterday, they showed \"Return To Cabin By The Lake.\" I have to admit, I wasn't too thrilled after watching it.\n\nThe original \"Cabin By The Lake\" was a charmingly popular low-budget film and was quite well-received. However, this sequel didn't quite hit the mark. It lacks the unintentional humor of the original and seems like it's trying too hard to mimic it. The plot, unfortunately, doesn't make much sense.\n\nAt times, the movie comes across more like a soap opera with its over-the-top dialogues, cinematography, and direction.\n\nMy advice: you might want to skip this one. It's a film that probably won't be enjoyed by most, not even by fans of quirky, mediocre filmmaking.\n\nJust a heads up!", "Absurd follow-up strains believability immensely as the nefarious psychopath Stanley Kaldwell makes a comeback, this time infiltrating the film adaptation of his novel on garden drownings by impersonating a second unit director he assassinated.\n\nThe film mockingly skewers Hollywood with a cheeky script targeting domineering directors who engage in affairs with their actresses (..seeking career advancement) and detest any form of competition for the limelight. Brian Krause, who I found dreadful, hams it up so much that the satire feels overly exaggerated, plays the boisterous and moody director who resents his second unit director and screenplay writer, Alison (..played by Dahlia Salem), for seemingly taking over the production. Andrew Moxham is Paul Parsons, sibling to a victim from the first installment. The film's dark humor this time explores the notion of a serial killer directing a movie and milks this concept for all it's worth. Nelson effortlessly slides back into his maniacal role, with Stanley as cunning as ever, manipulating a film production and murdering anyone in his way to maintain total dominance over his project, until Alison uncovers his true identity. Alison is a driven writer eager to delve into Stanley's psyche to understand his motives, why he committed murder, and what led him down his sinister path. The irony of Alison working closely with the actual killer is central to the dark comedic aspect of this thriller. Predictably, a face-off between Alison and Stanley ensues, culminating in an utterly implausible and far-fetched resolution regarding the killer's destiny (..a tough pill to swallow). Unlike the first movie, which was sleekly polished, director Po-Chih Leong employs unnecessary techniques (..such as bizarre camera angles, slow-motion in sepia, and several scenes shot on video) that annoy rather than impress. This sequel, in my opinion, missed the mark compared to the original, with much of the humor being less effective and more blatant.", "\"Return to Cabin by the Lake was quite disappointing. The movie must have had a very low budget since part of it appears to be filmed with a simple video camera. This results in scenes that awkwardly mix movie-quality shots with those of amateur video, creating a very odd blend. They really should have avoided the 'home video' effect somehow.\n\nHowever, if you've seen the original Cabin by the Lake, it\u2019s worth watching to compare and spot the differences. But if you haven't seen the original, this sequel might come across as too cheesy and could discourage you from ever giving the first one a chance.\"", "Considering this movie was made-for-TV, I'm not going to criticize it as harshly as I would a feature film. The script is below average, but it manages to be mildly humorous at times, whether intentionally or not. The acting is mostly exaggerated, which is common in many lower-budget movies.\n\nThe aspect of this movie that I truly disliked was that 90-95% of it is shot on film, but occasionally there will be 5-10 seconds where the footage is shot on video. This is noticeable because the video has less contrast, the colors are less vivid, and the footage runs at 30 frames per second instead of film's 24 frames per second. I suspect that these scenes were shot later due to budget constraints, which is disorienting and detracts from the film's overall quality.\n\nOverall, I've seen worse movies, but I can't say I enjoyed this one, and I wouldn't recommend anyone to watch it.", "Thinking of watching this movie? Think again. I rarely share my thoughts on what I watch, but this disaster compelled me to speak out. Not only was it a colossal waste of my time, but dissecting its flaws could take a lifetime\u2014and frankly, it\u2019s not worth it. Simply put, avoid this movie at all costs. It\u2019s a black hole of wasted hours you\u2019ll never get back. And those glowing reviews? Either the authors are completely clueless or on the studio\u2019s payroll. Trust me, you'll regret every second spent on this train wreck!", "I watched this on the Sci-Fi channel, right after the first movie. For some reason, it kept me interested, though I\u2019m not sure why.\n\n---SPOILERS--- The way the guy got involved in the movie was cheesy. In the first movie, he had a \"reason\" to kill people, but in this sequel, many of the killings made no sense. Stanley killed the director and captured the co-writer because of creative differences, but why try to kill the cast? No cast, no movie. He wanted it to \"look real when they died\"? If it\u2019s a high-budget movie, use special effects. Like in the first one, the captured girl escapes, Stanley gets messed up, and disappears. Wow (sarcastic). This movie had potential, but the saddest part is, I would watch \"Cabin by the Lake 3,\" only because I like Judd Nelson. He's the best part of this sequel.", "I watched \"Cabin by the Lake\" this afternoon on USA, and for a made-for-TV movie, it was surprisingly engaging enough to make me curious about the sequel. So, I tuned in this evening, only to be sorely disappointed. While I didn't have high expectations, I was completely bewildered by the use of digital video (DV). The film could have been halfway decent if it weren't for those jarring digital shots that appeared out of nowhere. I anticipated some plot connection to these shots, but they seemed utterly pointless.\n\n(SPOILER ALERT!!) The open ending of the first \"Cabin by the Lake\" was acceptable, but the sequel's open ending was downright absurd. I can only imagine that the \"Return of Return to Cabin by the Lake\" would be watchable if it were the only option available, competing solely against late-night infomercials at 4 AM.", "A decent sequel, but it lacks the impact of the original. Judd Nelson plays a murderous screenwriter who adopts new identities to direct his novel, \"CABIN BY THE LAKE.\" Though there are still ruthless killings, the movie feels overly tongue-in-cheek and the humor falls flat. The film has a rushed quality, and Nelson's performance is often overdone. Ironically, it's about a script being rewritten before filming, which should have happened to this one.", "\"Return to Cabin by the Lake\" falls far short of its predecessor. Featuring only one returning main character, Stanley, this sequel isn't worth the two hours it demands. As a dedicated fan of the original film, which boasted a compelling storyline and strong performances, I find this follow-up sorely disappointing. It's reminiscent of the subpar sequels to \"Urban Legends\" and \"Blair Witch\" but suffers from even worse acting. The performances here are so poor that they pale in comparison to soap operas, eliciting more laughter than engagement. I strongly advise against watching this movie; it will only tarnish your memories of the first.", "I was really expecting Hedy Burress to return for part 2, especially since she managed to escape her watery fate in the first film. But it looks like that's not happening. Honestly, they should have given her a dramatic exit like in Friday The 13th Part 2\u2014you know, something memorable.<br /><br />Just like Scream 3 and Urban Legend 2, this sequel tried the whole \"movie within a movie\" angle, and it was a complete disaster.<br /><br />This film was utter garbage. Seriously, that movie within a movie gimmick was terrible.<br /><br />Avoid this one at all costs!", "Viewers who are raving about every aspect of this film, including its opening credits, might lead you to think it's some kind of cinematic masterpiece. But believe me, folks, this is one of the most cringe-worthy films out there. If you're not laughing at it within the first five minutes, I\u2019d say you've lost your sense of humor.\n\nDavid Niven stars as an RAF pilot full of bravado, who bizarrely decides to chat about love with a young, impressionable female air traffic controller while he's plummeting to what seems like a fiery death. (How romantic\u2026) By a twist of fate, he survives and ends up on a beach right when the same air traffic controller happens to be bicycling by. (They instantly connect.)\n\nLooking beyond the strange homoerotic undertones (which are so exaggerated they should probably be called supertexts, including a naked boy playing flute on the beach and a flamboyant celestial messenger with overly-thick makeup), the most puzzling part of this movie is how it awkwardly uses national and racial stereotypes to try and make a point about the universal power of love. Spoiler alert: men in uniform like women in skirts and heels, who reciprocate, and apparently shedding a few tears can elevate a film to a ten-star rating on IMDb\u2026\n\nIn terms of production quality, the continuity and editing are cringe-worthy, while the lighting might be even worse, though the terrible script hardly leaves you time to notice. The film plays around with Technicolor effects (heaven is depicted in black and white), foreshadowing (so laughable that my usually appreciative movie companion cheered and laughed when a doc\u2019s motorcycle finally crashed), and freeze-motion scenes (particularly hilarious as the female lead struggles to stay still, undoubtedly amusing the off-camera crew).\n\nThe best scenes are the early beach shots, but it's a steep decline from there. The moving staircase (resembling an escalator) is no match for the iconic Odessa Steps, to put it mildly. I'd advise against feeling obligated to watch this feeble attempt at filmmaking. The movie is so bad that it\u2019s amusing, and that\u2019s probably the highest praise I can give it."]
