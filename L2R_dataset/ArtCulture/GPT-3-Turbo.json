Postmodern thought is characterized by self-referentiality, epistemological relativism, moral relativism, pluralism, irony, irreverence, and eclecticism. It challenges the notion of universal truths inherent in binary oppositions, fixed identities, hierarchical structures, and rigid categorizations.", "Postmodernism burst onto the scene in the mid-twentieth century as a rebellious response to the established norms of modernism. It has since permeated numerous fields, reflecting a departure from traditional modes of thought. Embracing deconstruction and post-structuralism, postmodernism has sparked debates, with some praising its innovation while others criticize it as veering towards obscurantism and eschewing rationalism and scientific principles. These divergent perspectives continue to shape our understanding of contemporary intellectual discourse.", "Kinetic art is art that involves movement or relies on motion for its effect.", "Kinetic art, primarily seen in early canvas paintings that expand the viewer's perspective and incorporate multidimensional movement, now most commonly refers to three-dimensional sculptures and figures like mobiles that move naturally or by machine operation.", "Videos on this page showcase works by George Rickey, Uli Aschenborn, and Sarnikoff.", "The dynamic components are typically driven by the force of the wind, a powerful motor, or the attentive observer.", "Kinetic art includes a broad range of intertwined techniques and styles.", "Some parts of kinetic art exude an illusion of movement, where the piece appears to come alive when viewed from specific angles or sections.", "This term often contrasts with the term \"apparent movement\", which is commonly used to describe an artwork's motion generated by motors, machinery, or electrical systems.", "Recently, there's been a discussion around whether both apparent and virtual movement can be considered styles of op art. While there are similarities between kinetic and op art, they aren't quite similar enough to be grouped under the same category. However, there are still clear distinctions that need to be acknowledged.", "The term \"Kinetic art\" originated from various sources.", "Kinetic art traces its roots back to late 19th-century Impressionist artists like Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, and \u00c9douard Manet, who boldly explored capturing the dynamic movement of human figures on canvas.", "These three impressionist painters aimed to create art that was more realistic than that of their peers.", "Degas' paintings of dancers and racehorses showcase his idea of \"photographic realism\". In the late 19th century, artists like Degas aimed to counter the rise of photography by creating vibrant and rhythmic landscapes and portraits.", "By the start of the 20th century, some artists increasingly leaned towards attributing their art to energetic movement.", "Naum Gabo, one of the two artists credited with coining this artistic style, often described his creations as embodying \"kinetic rhythm\".

This abstract and minimalistic art style sought to represent the modern industrial society and urban environment. Constructivist art focused on using industrial materials rather than decorative elements. Artists in this movement believed in creating art for propaganda and social causes, aligning themselves with Soviet socialism, the Bolsheviks, and the Russian avant-garde.", "Constructivist architecture and art greatly influenced 20th-century modern art movements, shaping major trends like the Bauhaus and De Stijl movements with an electrifying impact!", "Its impact was significant and spread across various fields such as architecture, sculpture, design, theater, film, dance, fashion, and somewhat in music.", "Performance art refers to an expression of artwork or art exhibition crafted through actions carried out by the artist or by other involved participants."]
