This movement took major inspiration from the dynamic world of German Expressionist painters, including the vibrant works of Emil Nolde, Max Beckmann, George Grosz, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, James Ensor, and Edvard Munch.", "It's also tied to the vibrant American Lyrical Abstraction painting of the '60s and '70s, the bold Hairy Who movement in Chicago, the dynamic Bay Area Figurative School of the '50s and '60s, the relentless evolution of Abstract Expressionism, the innovative precedents in Pop Painting, and the energetic New Image Painting\u2014a dynamic late '70s movement where artists unleashed a striking figurative style with cartoon-like imagery and an unapologetically abrasive flair that echoed Neo-Expressionism.", "The term \"New Image Painting\" really caught on after a 1978 exhibition called New Image Painting at the Whitney Museum.", "Folk art encompasses all forms of visual expression created within the framework of folk culture.", "Definitions vary, but generally, the objects serve a practical purpose beyond mere decoration.", "Folk artists are usually educated within a widespread tradition, as opposed to the fine art tradition of their culture.", "There is frequently overlap or disputed territory with 'naive art.'", "\"Folk art\" bursts with life and vibrancy, distinct from the captivating creations of traditional societies where ethnographic art thrives continuously.", "The term \"folk art\" encompasses a wide array of objects, each distinct in its expression and cultural significance.", "\"understood through its use in Europe, where the term first appeared, and in the United States, where it evolved in quite a different way.\"", "From a European viewpoint, Edward Lucie-Smith characterized it as \"Art, both fine and applied, that is considered unrefined and originates from the collective consciousness of humble folks.\"", "The notion of folk art is uniquely a product of the 19th century.", "Nowadays, it evokes a sense of longing for a pre-industrial era.", "Folk arts showcase the cultural life of a community.", "The art form encompasses the expressive culture associated with the domains of folklore and cultural heritage.", "Tangible folk art includes traditionally crafted community objects.", "Intangible folk arts can encompass various forms, including music, dance, narrative structures, and art galleries.", "Each of these art forms, whether tangible or intangible, has been brilliantly crafted to serve a practical purpose!", "When the purpose is lost or forgotten, further transmission is pointless unless the object or action has gained additional meaning.", "These artistic traditions are shaped by values and standards handed down from generation to generation, primarily within families and communities, through demonstration, conversation, and practice.", "Postmodernism is an intellectual stance marked by skepticism towards the \"grand narratives\" of modernism, rejecting the certainty or stability of meaning, and highlighting ideology as a tool for maintaining political power. It dismisses claims to objective facts as na\u00efve realism, focusing instead on the conditional nature of knowledge within specific historical, political, and cultural contexts.

While the overlap between kinetic and op art isn't substantial enough to merge them under a single umbrella term, intriguing distinctions remain to be fully explored and defined by artists and art historians alike.", "The term \"Kinetic art\" emerged from a rich tapestry of influences, making it a powerful and dynamic descriptor for this innovative art form.", "Kinetic art traces its origins to the late 19th century, influenced by the Impressionist painters Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, and \u00c9douard Manet, who initially explored the enhancement of human movement in their canvases.", "These three impressionist painters aimed to produce art that felt more real compared to their peers.", "Edgar Degas\u2019 portraits of dancers and racehorses exemplify his concept of \"photographic realism.\" In the late 19th century, artists like Degas sought to counter the rise of photography by creating vibrant, rhythmically composed landscapes and portraits.", "By the early 1900s, many artists became increasingly captivated by infusing their work with dynamic motion.", "Naum Gabo, a pioneering artist who co-coined the name for this style, passionately championed his work as prime examples of \"kinetic rhythm.\" He ardently believed that his revolutionary moving sculpture, Kinetic Construction (also known as Standing Wave, 1919\u201320), was the groundbreaking first of its kind in the 20th century.", "From the 1920s to the 1960s, visionary artists revolutionized kinetic art, boldly experimenting with mobiles and pioneering new sculptural forms.", "Constructivism burst onto the art scene in the early 20th century, thanks to the visionary minds of Vladimir Tatlin and Alexander Rodchenko in 1915.
