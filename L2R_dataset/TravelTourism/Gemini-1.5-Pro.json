["Imagine building software where different parts run at the same time without crashing. That's what concurrent programming is all about, and it's tricky!\n\nSome smart folks have been using logic systems, like those found in $\\pi$DILL and CP, to make this easier and prevent those dreaded deadlocks (where everything grinds to a halt). However, there's a bit of a problem: the way we build these logic proofs doesn't quite match up with how we actually write concurrent programs. It's like trying to fit square blocks into round holes.\n\nOne attempt to bridge this gap is Hypersequent Classical Processes (HCP).  They use a clever trick called \"hypersequents\" to better represent how things run in parallel.  Think of it like organizing your tools into multiple toolboxes instead of just one.  \n\nBut HCP is still a work in progress. It's like having a fancy new toolbox without knowing how to use all the tools yet. It doesn't have a clear way to simulate how a program would actually run, and some of its features don't play nicely with existing systems.\n\nThat's where HCP- comes in!  We've streamlined HCP, giving it a proper \"engine\" (reduction semantics) and removing some unnecessary complexities. We've proven that HCP- avoids deadlocks, behaves predictably, and can handle the same communication tasks as before.  \n\nThink of HCP- as a more practical and user-friendly version of HCP, ready to tackle real-world concurrency challenges!\n", "We introduce a simplified version of the BDDC preconditioner, which cleverly manages constraints on specific parts of the problem domain (like edges, faces, and vertices within and between subdomains). This method offers impressive performance, with the condition number \u2013 a measure of how well-suited a problem is for numerical solution \u2013 demonstrably limited by  $C \\big(1+\\log (L/h)\\big)^2$. Here, $C$ is a constant, while $h$ and $L$ represent the typical sizes of the mesh elements and these chosen subobjects, respectively.\n\nThe beauty of this approach lies in the freedom to select $L$ almost arbitrarily. By strategically choosing its value, we can theoretically shrink the condition number to practically a constant ($O(1)$), leading to significantly faster computations.  \n\nThis work further delves into the advantages and disadvantages of this streamlined preconditioner, highlighting its effectiveness in tackling problems with varying material properties or other heterogeneities.  We present compelling numerical results achieved on high-performance computing clusters to showcase its real-world applicability. \n", "In this presentation, we will explore instances where the Heun function arises as a solution to wave equations within the framework of general relativity.  It is known that the Dirac equation, formulated against the backdrop of the Nutku helicoid metric, yields Mathieu functions as solutions in a four-dimensional spacetime.  We demonstrate that a straightforward extension to five dimensions leads to solutions expressible in terms of the double confluent Heun function.  Furthermore, we establish a reduction of this solution to the familiar Mathieu function via a series of transformations. It is crucial to note that the presence of a singularity in the metric at the origin necessitates the imposition of Atiyah-Patodi-Singer spectral boundary conditions on this system. \n", "Extensive research has demonstrated that the gradual decline in X-ray emissions observed during the decay phase of long-duration flares (LDEs) strongly suggests continuous magnetic reconnection and energy release in the coronal region of the flare.  This study utilizes RHESSI data to address two key questions: the effectiveness of these processes during the LDE decay phase, and the precise calculation of the energy release rate from this data.\n\nTo investigate these questions, we reconstructed images of selected LDEs during their decay phases. A comprehensive spectral analysis of these images allowed for the extraction of physical parameters associated with coronal sources, enabling an evaluation of the energy release process efficiency.  Furthermore, a thorough examination of the terms within the energy equation was conducted to determine the accuracy associated with each term's determination. \n", "Using a multi-scale approach, we characterize the typical geometry of clusters in random media under the FK measure.  This result applies to dimensions two and higher, assuming slab percolation holds under the averaged measure, a condition expected throughout the supercritical phase.  Our work builds upon Pisztora's findings and offers a crucial tool for analyzing the supercritical regime in disordered FK models, as well as their corresponding Ising and Potts counterparts. \n", "Young stars called Classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) are known for their faint photospheric absorption lines, a phenomenon called \"veiling.\" This is usually attributed to extra light emission from hot gas near the star's surface, heated by accretion streams. \n\nWe studied four CTTS with unusually strong veiling to see if this effect matches standard models of accretion, where varying accretion rates should lead to predictable changes in brightness and emission line strength.\n\nOur observations showed that while veiling in these stars is highly variable, it doesn't behave as expected. The amount of veiling often implies an unrealistically high energy release, and it doesn't correlate well with brightness or emission line strength. Additionally, rapid changes in veiling occur independently of the stars' rotation.\n\nWe found that the strong veiling in at least three stars is actually caused by emission filling in the photospheric absorption lines, rather than an increase in continuous emission. This means veiling can't be reliably used to estimate accretion rates in CTTS with strong emission lines. \n", "Giant low surface brightness (GLSB) galaxies, characterized by their diffuse nature, have been traditionally considered as systems dominated by dark matter. This assumption, however, stems from analyses based on poorly constrained rotation curves. Our study presents a refined investigation of two archetypal GLSB galaxies, Malin 1 and NGC 7589, utilizing re-analyzed HI observations to construct new rotation curves.\n\nContrary to previous findings, our results reveal a steep central rise in the rotation curves of both galaxies, a feature typically associated with high surface brightness (HSB) systems.  Mass decompositions incorporating a dark matter halo indicate that baryonic matter might be the dominant factor influencing the dynamics of their inner regions.  \n\nRemarkably, a \"maximum disk\" fit yields stellar mass-to-light ratios consistent with those observed in HSB galaxies. These findings, along with recent studies, suggest that GLSB galaxies may possess a dual structure: an inner, early-type spiral galaxy exhibiting HSB characteristics, embedded within a diffuse outer LSB disk.\n\nFurthermore, we tested the MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics) framework.  While NGC 7589's rotation curve aligns well with MOND predictions, Malin 1 presents a significant challenge to the theory. \n", "This study investigates the characteristics of target evaporated fragments produced in forward and backward hemispheres during high-energy nuclear collisions. We analyzed data from interactions of $^{4}$He, $^{16}$O, $^{84}$Kr, and $^{197}$Au beams with AgBr emulsion targets at various energies. \n\nOur analysis focused on several key parameters of the fragment distributions: multiplicity distribution, multiplicity moments, scaled variance, and entropy.  We found that the multiplicity distribution of target evaporated fragments in both hemispheres can be well-described by a Gaussian distribution.  \n\nExamining the multiplicity moments, we observed a consistent increase with the order of the moment (q).  Furthermore, the second-order multiplicity moment exhibited energy independence across all studied interactions, indicating a consistent behavior across different energy regimes.\n\nThe scaled variance, a measure of multiplicity fluctuations, remained close to unity for all interactions.  This suggests a weak correlation among the produced particles. \n\nFinally, our results demonstrate that the entropy of target evaporated fragments in the forward and backward hemispheres are comparable within experimental uncertainties. This suggests a similar degree of disorder in the fragment production mechanism regardless of the emission direction. \n", "Harnessing the power of fast acoustic phonons, we propose a novel scheme for ultrafast state preparation in quantum dots using off-resonant optical excitation.  Our theoretical investigation reveals three distinct stages in this process: an initial dressing of states upon laser pulse arrival, followed by phonon-mediated relaxation, and culminating in an adiabatic undressing as the pulse subsides. \n\nCrucially, we demonstrate that achieving adiabatic undressing through tailored pulse shapes dramatically enhances the fidelity of target state preparation. This highlights the critical role of pulse shaping in short-pulse protocols.\n\nFurthermore, our findings establish a powerful framework for selective state preparation in exciton-biexciton systems. By strategically manipulating laser parameters such as pulse detuning and duration, as well as exploiting the biexciton binding energy, we can precisely steer the quantum dot into a desired quantum state.  This opens exciting avenues for manipulating and controlling quantum states in semiconductor nanostructures. \n", "Imagine a detective arriving at the scene of a crime.  The standard \"Hilbert space\" approach to quantum mechanics is like finding a jumbled mess of clues and trying to make sense of it after the fact. We observe that nature seems to behave probabilistically, so we bolt on this idea of probability to our equations, explaining things after we've already seen them.\n\nBut what if we could find a more elegant approach, one where probability is built into the very fabric of our theory?  That's where \"quantum logics\" come in, like a detective meticulously cataloging every piece of evidence with its own unique probability from the start. \n\nPicture this: a sprawling mansion, its many rooms representing different possible quantum states.  In this framework, known as \"quantum logics with unique conditional probabilities,\" we can map out every possible outcome, every \"event,\" with its own likelihood.  The famous \"collapse\" of the quantum state, the moment we gain knowledge of a particle's property, becomes a smooth transition in this house of probabilities, guided by the rules of measurement.\n\nWithin this mansion, there are different levels of \"compatibility\" between events, like clues that might be connected or completely independent.  Do these events interfere with each other, or can they be measured simultaneously without consequence?  Can we predict the outcome of one event based on another?  These questions unravel as we navigate the five levels of compatibility, uncovering the hidden relationships between quantum events.\n\nWhile these levels might seem distinct in the grand mansion of quantum logic, they beautifully converge in certain well-known rooms, like the familiar Hilbert space of quantum mechanics or the elegant formalisms of von Neumann algebras. It's as if our detective, after meticulously analyzing every detail, finally pieces together a clear and consistent narrative from the seemingly disparate clues.\n\nThis is the promise of quantum logics \u2013 to unveil a deeper, more intuitive understanding of the quantum world, where probability isn't just an afterthought, but an essential thread woven into the very fabric of reality.\n", "This study presents a rigorous analysis of wave-vector dispersion within elliptically birefringent stratified magneto-optic media exhibiting one-dimensional periodicity.  We demonstrate that discrepancies in the local normal-mode polarization states between consecutive layers induce inter-mode coupling, profoundly influencing the wave-vector dispersion characteristics and the nature of the system's Bloch states.\n\nThis coupling mechanism gives rise to additional terms in the dispersion relation, absent in uniform circularly birefringent magneto-optic stratified media. Notably, normal mode coupling can lift the degeneracy at frequency band crossover points under specific conditions, leading to the emergence of a magnetization-dependent optical band gap.\n\nWe establish the criteria for the formation of this band gap, demonstrating that it can be characterized by a coupling parameter directly related to the polarization state mismatch between local normal modes in adjacent layers.\n\nFurthermore, we delve into the analysis of Bloch states within this system, elucidating the conditions for maximizing the magnitude of the induced band splitting.  Our findings provide insights into the interplay between structural anisotropy, magnetic effects, and photonic band structures in magneto-optic media, with implications for optical device design and control. \n", "This study delves into a novel extension of classical empirical risk minimization (ERM), where the hypothesis space is no longer deterministic but rather a randomly chosen subspace of the original hypothesis space. We focus on data-dependent subspaces formed by the span of randomly selected data points, a framework encompassing Nystr\u00f6m methods commonly employed in kernel methods as a special case.\n\nWhile employing random subspaces inherently reduces computational burden, a critical question arises: does this strategy compromise learning accuracy?  Recent investigations have explored these statistical-computational trade-offs in the context of least squares and smooth self-concordant loss functions, such as the logistic loss.  \n\nOur work extends these analyses to encompass non-smooth convex Lipschitz loss functions, exemplified by the hinge loss prevalent in support vector machines. This generalization necessitates the development of novel proof techniques to accommodate the non-smooth nature of the loss function. \n\nOur primary findings reveal the existence of distinct regimes, contingent on the learning problem's inherent difficulty, where computational efficiency can be significantly enhanced without sacrificing learning performance.  Specifically, we establish theoretical guarantees for the performance of our proposed method, demonstrating its ability to achieve optimal statistical rates while substantially reducing computational cost.\n\nThese theoretical insights are corroborated by numerical experiments, showcasing the practical benefits of our approach across various learning scenarios. Our results provide a compelling argument for considering random subspaces in ERM, particularly when dealing with large-scale datasets and complex loss functions. \n", "Traditional patient consent methods, relying on static paper forms, are being superseded by integrated e-Health systems that empower patients with more dynamic consent management. However, capturing the nuances of consent across diverse situations using authorization policies is complex and error-prone. To address this, we introduce ACTORS, a novel goal-driven consent management approach.  ACTORS leverages the adaptability of Teleo-Reactive (TR) programming to dynamically adjust consent permissions based on changes in the patient's context and the specific domain of data access. \n", "This paper delves into the intricate interplay between stochastic processes and fractional differential equations, focusing on the inverse random source problem for the time-fractional diffusion equation.  We consider a scenario where the source term is not deterministic but rather driven by the stochastic dynamics of a fractional Brownian motion.\n\nOur investigation unfolds in two parts. First, we address the well-posedness of the direct problem: given a fractional Brownian motion as the driving force, can we ensure the existence and uniqueness of a solution for the resulting stochastic time-fractional diffusion equation?  We establish affirmative answers to these questions under certain conditions, providing a rigorous foundation for analyzing the system's behavior.\n\nThe second part tackles the more challenging inverse problem: if we only have access to the statistical properties of the solution at a final time point (specifically, its expectation and variance), can we \"rewind\" the system's evolution and recover information about the underlying random source?  We demonstrate the uniqueness of this inverse problem, implying that the final time statistics contain sufficient information to identify the source's distribution.  Furthermore, we characterize the problem's instability, highlighting the sensitivity of the source reconstruction to perturbations in the final time data.\n\nOur analysis hinges on the unique properties of the Mittag-Leffler function, a generalization of the exponential function that plays a central role in fractional calculus, and the intricacies of stochastic integration with respect to fractional Brownian motion. This study sheds light on the intricate nature of inverse problems in the context of fractional diffusion and paves the way for further explorations within this rich mathematical landscape.\n", "Imagine trying to map a vast, uncharted territory, but the only information you have are the distances between scattered landmarks. That's the challenge we face when dealing with high-dimensional data sets, where the true structure hides within a complex web of interconnected points.\n\nManifold learning methods, particularly those based on graphs, have emerged as powerful tools for navigating this terrain. Picture a network of dots, each representing a data point, connected by lines whose thickness corresponds to their similarity. By analyzing this network, we can uncover the hidden low-dimensional landscape upon which the data actually resides.\n\nTraditional methods have relied heavily on the Euclidean distance, the familiar straight-line measurement between points. But what if our data's true geometry is more nuanced, better captured by alternative notions of distance? \n\nThis paper embarks on a journey to explore the uncharted territory of non-Euclidean manifold learning. We venture beyond the familiar Euclidean norm, equipping ourselves with a more diverse set of tools for measuring similarity.  \n\nThrough a blend of differential geometry and convex analysis, we unveil the mathematical principles governing these generalized graph Laplacians. Our results reveal how the choice of norm shapes the resulting map of the data, providing insights into which distance metric might best capture the essence of a given problem.\n\nTo illustrate the power of these new tools, we turn our attention to the intricate dance of large molecules, their shapes continuously changing over time.  We find that the Earthmover's distance, a measure sensitive to the distribution of mass within each molecule, proves remarkably adept at capturing these subtle transformations.\n\nOur modified Laplacian eigenmaps algorithm, guided by the Earthmover's distance, not only outperforms its classic Euclidean counterpart in mapping accuracy, but also does so with remarkable efficiency, requiring fewer data points and less computation time.\n\nThis exploration beyond the familiar Euclidean realm opens exciting new possibilities for manifold learning, empowering us to chart the complex landscapes hidden within data, no matter how intricate their geometry. \n", "Imagine a heat wave spreading across a complex, intricate surface, its boundaries pulsing with energy.  Capturing this intricate dance of heat is no easy feat, but mathematicians have a powerful tool at their disposal: the heat equation.\n\nTraditional methods for solving this equation resemble a meticulous grid search, dividing the surface into countless tiny squares and tracking the temperature at each point. While effective, this approach can quickly become computationally expensive, especially for complex geometries.\n\nThis paper unveils a more elegant solution, a mathematical symphony that captures the flow of heat with remarkable efficiency. Instead of painstakingly tracking every point in space and time, our approach begins by slicing time into thin, manageable slivers.\n\nWithin each time slice, the heat equation transforms into a modified Helmholtz equation, a familiar friend in the world of wave phenomena. We then summon the power of potential theory, representing the temperature distribution as a combination of two elegant components: a volume potential, capturing the heat emanating from within the surface, and a double layer potential, reflecting the influence of the boundary.\n\nTo tame the computational complexity, we enlist the help of the fast multipole method (FMM), a mathematical virtuoso that can efficiently calculate the interactions between distant points.  This allows us to gracefully handle the volume potential, reducing the computational burden significantly.\n\nNext, we turn our attention to the boundary, the pulsating edge of our heat wave. Here, an integral equation emerges, its solution holding the key to satisfying the boundary conditions.  Once again, the FMM steps in, accelerating our calculations and ensuring a swift resolution.\n\nThe result?  A remarkably efficient method for simulating heat flow, even across the most intricate of surfaces.  With a computational cost that scales linearly or near-linearly with the number of points, our approach outperforms traditional methods, opening new avenues for exploring the fascinating world of heat transfer. \n", "This research explores the exciting potential of qudits, higher-dimensional quantum systems, for enhancing the security and efficiency of quantum communication.  We investigate a scheme where sequential state-discrimination measurements are employed to decipher the initial state of a qudit chosen from a set of non-orthogonal quantum states.\n\nWhile perfectly distinguishing these states is impossible due to their inherent overlap, our approach leverages the power of unambiguous state discrimination. This technique guarantees error-free measurements while accepting the possibility of inconclusive outcomes.\n\nBy harnessing qudits, which can encode more information per unit than their two-level counterparts (qubits), we unlock new possibilities for communication efficiency. Our analysis focuses on a scenario where a sender, Alice, transmits one qudit chosen from a set of N, with each qudit possessing N dimensions. We explore two distinct cases: one with uniform state overlap and another with varying overlaps between two distinct subsets of qudits.\n\nExcitingly, we demonstrate that this qudit-based approach offers increased robustness against eavesdropping compared to traditional qubit-based schemes.  The higher dimensionality of qudits makes it significantly more likely for an eavesdropper to introduce detectable errors when attempting to intercept the transmitted information.  Our findings highlight the potential of qudits for developing more secure and efficient quantum communication protocols.\n", "This work decisively enhances access control security within the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain framework. We achieve this by seamlessly integrating multiple IDs, attributes, and policies into the core access control mechanisms.\n\nOur approach begins with a comprehensive analysis of Hyperledger Fabric's existing access control system. We then introduce a novel implementation that builds upon this foundation, empowering users and developers with streamlined and flexible access control decisions based on combinations of IDs, attributes, and policies.\n\nThis enhanced system incorporates a modified Fabric CA client, simplifying the process of attribute addition and certificate management for new users.  We demonstrate unequivocally that integrating multiple IDs, attributes, and policies is not only feasible but also highly effective in bolstering security within the Hyperledger Fabric ecosystem.\n\nFurthermore, our performance evaluation confirms that the added security measures have a negligible impact on real-world applications compared to the inherent risks of unrestricted resource access. This research delivers a practical and robust solution for significantly improving access control within Hyperledger Fabric. \n", "This presentation provides a definitive update on the ongoing solar axion search conducted by the CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST).  We present compelling results from the initial phase of CAST Phase II, where the magnet bores were systematically filled with 4He gas at varying pressures. This technique enabled a comprehensive scan for axion masses up to 0.4 eV.\n\nOur analysis, based on the absence of excess X-ray signals when the magnet was directed at the Sun, establishes a stringent upper limit on the axion-photon coupling constant.  For axion masses below 0.4 eV, we confidently constrain the coupling to g < 2.17 x 10^10 GeV^-1 at a 95% confidence level, with the precise value contingent upon the specific pressure setting.\n\nCAST Phase II is currently exploring the axion mass range up to 1.2 eV, utilizing 3He as a buffer gas. We will present projected sensitivities for this ongoing search.  \n\nLooking beyond CAST Phase II, we will outline near-future experimental endeavors and explore long-term options for next-generation helioscope experiments, paving the way for increasingly sensitive explorations of the axion parameter space. \n", "Get this:  the Arctic sea ice is vanishing before our eyes, while down south, the Antarctic ice is actually expanding! This perplexing mismatch has been a real head-scratcher for climate scientists, especially since our fancy climate models usually show both polar regions losing ice, just not at such a dramatic pace.\n\nBut wait!  Could the models actually hold the key to cracking this icy mystery? Recent studies have hinted that hidden within the simulations, masked by natural climate wobbles, might lie a more accurate picture.  \n\nWell, we dove headfirst into the latest and greatest climate simulations from CMIP5 and CESM-LE, armed with the knowledge that global temperature and sea ice extent are like two peas in a pod.  And guess what?  The models simulating a rapidly melting Arctic like we see in the real world are all running way too hot! They show far more global warming than actual observations.\n\nUsing not one, but two different methods to account for the real-world temperature trends, we discovered that the chances of these models producing such a rapid Arctic ice meltdown are incredibly slim -  less than 1%! Clearly, something's not quite adding up.\n\nDown in the Antarctic, things are a bit murkier. While the simulations that match the observed ice growth tend to underestimate global warming, the results aren't as clear-cut. However, the models still struggle to capture the stark contrast between the two poles.\n\nThis leads to a fascinating possibility: are our models accidentally getting the right sea ice trends for the wrong reasons? This intriguing puzzle highlights the need to refine our understanding of the complex interplay driving changes at both poles, ensuring our models paint a truly accurate picture of our planet's future. \n", "Biometric authentication is rapidly emerging as a critical component for securing the ever-expanding Internet of Things (IoT).  This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the challenges and opportunities presented by biometric authentication in the context of IoT devices.\n\nWe begin by examining the key factors hindering the widespread adoption of biometric models, encompassing both physiological (e.g., face, iris, fingerprint) and behavioral (e.g., gait, voice, keystroke) biometrics.  We delve into the limitations imposed by data availability, computational constraints, privacy concerns, and the unique security threats present in the IoT ecosystem.\n\nNext, we provide a detailed review of machine learning and data mining techniques employed in biometric authentication and authorization schemes for mobile IoT devices. This encompasses a wide range of approaches, from traditional statistical methods to cutting-edge deep learning algorithms.\n\nRecognizing the importance of robust security, we present a thorough analysis of common threat models and corresponding countermeasures employed by biometric-based authentication schemes for mobile IoT. This includes discussions on spoofing attacks, adversarial machine learning, and privacy-preserving techniques.\n\nFinally, we synthesize our findings to highlight key challenges and promising research directions for the future of biometric-based authentication in the IoT. These encompass areas such as developing lightweight and privacy-preserving algorithms, addressing adversarial attacks, and ensuring fairness and inclusivity in biometric systems. \n", "Device fingerprinting, a technique used to identify devices on the web, has gained significant traction. However, existing methods rely on software-based features that users can easily manipulate, compromising their effectiveness.\n\nThis paper argues that the advent of HTML5 presents a unique opportunity to leverage hardware-based fingerprinting, which is significantly more resistant to manipulation. We propose several novel techniques that enable HTML5 web applications to extract identifying information from a device's hardware.\n\nAs a proof of concept, we present an initial experiment demonstrating the feasibility of fingerprinting a device's GPU using HTML5. Our findings highlight the potential of hardware-based fingerprinting for enhancing device identification accuracy and resilience against manipulation. \n", "We establish a compelling connection between Chern-Simons theory with exceptional gauge groups on the three-sphere and the refined closed topological string.  Specifically, we demonstrate that the Chern-Simons partition function can be expressed in terms of the refined topological string partition function, with a precise relation between their parameters: $2\\tau=g_s(1-b)$. Here, $\\tau$ represents the single K\u00e4hler parameter, $g_s$ is the string coupling constant, and $b$ is the refinement parameter, taking on specific rational values for each exceptional group ($b=\\frac{5}{3},\\frac{5}{2},3,4,6$ for $G_2, F_4, E_6, E_7, E_8$, respectively).\n\nOur derivation hinges on the universal form of the Chern-Simons partition function on the three-sphere, as characterized by Vogel's parameters.  By restricting this universal form to a specific line in Vogel's parameter space defined by $\\gamma=2(\\alpha+\\beta)$ (which includes all exceptional groups), we arrive at our result. Notably, the non-zero BPS invariants in this case are found to be $N^2_{0,\\frac{1}{2}}=1$ and $N^{11}_{0,1}=1$, with the remaining contributions corresponding to refined constant maps in string theory.\n\nFurthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of this connection by considering a different line in Vogel's parameter space given by $\\gamma=\\alpha+\\beta$. This line encompasses the groups $SU(4)$, $SO(10)$, and $E_6$. Remarkably, we obtain analogous results, with non-zero BPS invariants  $N^2_{0,\\frac{1}{2}}=1$ and $N^{7}_{0,1}=1$.\n\nIn both cases, the refinement parameter $b$ (equivalent to $-\\epsilon_2/\\epsilon_1$ in Nekrasov's notation) can be directly expressed in terms of the universal parameters restricted to the respective lines as $b=-\\beta/\\alpha$. This result underscores a deep and universal connection between Chern-Simons theory with specific gauge groups and the refined topological string, potentially leading to new insights into both frameworks. \n", "Imagine trying to find a \"good representative\" for a scattered collection of data points.  In one dimension, we often use the median, which ensures that half the points lie on either side. This concept extends to higher dimensions with the centerpoint: a point that guarantees any half-space containing it also contains a significant portion (at least 1/(d+1)) of the data.\n\nBut what if we want multiple representatives, like using quantiles instead of just the median? This paper explores extending this idea to higher dimensions. \n\nInstead of a single centerpoint, we seek a small set of points called \"Q.\" This set has a special property: as you capture more points from \"Q\" within a half-space, you're guaranteed to capture an increasingly larger portion of the original data set.\n\nThis concept sits between two well-known ideas in discrete geometry: weak \u03b5-nets and weak \u03b5-approximations. It's more powerful than simply covering a certain fraction of the data (\u03b5-nets), but less restrictive than accurately representing the data's distribution within every possible range (\u03b5-approximations).  This paper paves the way for exploring this new notion of \"multi-representative\" points in higher dimensions, offering a new tool for understanding and summarizing complex data sets. \n", "This paper introduces \\textsc{PsrPopPy}, a powerful new software package designed for simulating realistic populations of pulsars. Building upon the foundation of the existing \\textsc{Psrpop} package, \\textsc{PsrPopPy} boasts a completely redesigned Python codebase, leveraging object-oriented programming principles for enhanced modularity and flexibility.\n\nThis significant overhaul offers several advantages.  First, it provides users with a more accessible and adaptable platform for conducting pulsar population synthesis studies. Pre-built scripts are available for standard simulations, while the modular architecture empowers users to easily customize simulations and incorporate new features, such as updated models for pulsar period or luminosity distributions.\n\nTo illustrate \\textsc{PsrPopPy}'s capabilities, we present two compelling applications.  First, by synthesizing pulsar populations and comparing them to multi-frequency survey data, we determine that pulsar spectral indices are best described by a normal distribution with a mean of -1.4 and a standard deviation of 1.0.\n\nSecond, we delve into pulsar spin evolution to refine the relationship between a pulsar's radio luminosity and its spin parameters (period and period derivative).  Replicating the analysis of Faucher-Gigu\\`ere & Kaspi, we utilize \\textsc{PsrPopPy} to optimize the power-law relationship between these quantities.  Our findings indicate that the underlying pulsar population's luminosity is best described by $L \\propto P^{-1.39 \\pm 0.09} \\dot{P}^{0.48 \\pm 0.04}$, remarkably similar to the relationship found for gamma-ray pulsars. \n\nLeveraging this refined relationship, we generate a model pulsar population and examine the intriguing age-luminosity relation for the entire population, a relationship that future large-scale surveys with the Square Kilometer Array may be poised to unravel. \n\n\n", "Imagine an intricate dance between light and matter, where a chorus of spins interacts with the rhythmic pulse of a confined light field. We delve into this fascinating realm, exploring the dynamics of a spin ensemble coupled intensely to a single-mode resonator, energized by carefully crafted external pulses.\n\nOur investigation reveals a captivating phenomenon: when the spin ensemble's average frequency resonates with the cavity mode, they engage in a damped tango \u2013 Rabi oscillations. We've developed a precise theoretical model that captures not just these oscillations, but also the subtle dephasing effects arising from variations in the spins' frequencies.\n\nHere's the surprising twist:  precise knowledge of this frequency spread is paramount, holding the key to unlocking a deeper understanding of the temporal dynamics of this coupled system.  Armed with this understanding, we can choreograph the external pulses to match specific resonance conditions, boosting the coherence of the oscillations between the spin ensemble and the cavity by orders of magnitude!\n\nBut it's not all theory!  We've put our ideas to the test in an experiment where an ensemble of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond takes center stage.  These NV centers, renowned for their remarkable quantum properties, are coupled strongly to a superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator \u2013 our stage for this intricate dance. The experimental results beautifully confirm our theoretical predictions, paving the way for exploring novel regimes of light-matter interaction in cavity quantum electrodynamics.  \n\n\n", "Imagine a chain of tiny quantum magnets, each pointing up or down, immersed in a magnetic field.  This system, known as the quantum Ising model, is a playground for exploring magnetism at the microscopic level. \n\nThis work digs into a more complex version of this model where the interactions between neighboring magnets can be different throughout the chain, making it \"inhomogeneous.\" We then explore how to characterize different phases of this quantum system using geometric tools.\n\nFirst, we find a way to express the system's energy in a simplified form by mapping it onto a collection of non-interacting fermions. This allows us to define a geometric space, a circle (S^1), that captures the system's essential properties through a \"twist operator.\"\n\nOn this circle, we can define a distance function, the \"ground-state cyclic quantum distance,\" which tells us how different two points in this space are in terms of their quantum properties.  We also define a \"ground-state Riemannian metric,\" which tells us how distances change as we move around this space.\n\nOur key finding is that this geometric framework provides a powerful way to distinguish between different phases of matter.  For example, the \"quantum ferromagnetic phase,\" where all the magnets tend to align, can be identified by a constant Riemannian metric and an invariant cyclic quantum distance. On the other hand, in the \"paramagnetic phase,\" where the magnets are disordered, the metric rapidly decays to zero. \n\nThis study provides a new perspective on characterizing quantum phases of matter in inhomogeneous systems, paving the way for a deeper understanding of these fascinating phenomena. \n", "Rotation measure synthesis is like having a special lens that allows us to peer into the invisible magnetic fields sprinkled throughout the cosmos. By cleverly analyzing the way light waves are twisted as they travel through space, this technique reveals a wealth of information about these enigmatic fields.\n\nThis research unlocks an exciting new chapter in our ability to study cosmic magnetism. We demonstrate that rotation measure synthesis, which uses a Fourier transform to map out magnetic fields, is mathematically analogous to the way interferometers combine light from multiple telescopes to produce sharper images. This realization is a game-changer!\n\nThis powerful analogy allows us to borrow techniques from the world of interferometry and apply them to the analysis of cosmic magnetic fields. Specifically, we can now accurately model the impact of \"channel averaging\" \u2013 a common observational constraint \u2013 during the reconstruction of Faraday rotation, a key measure of magnetic field strength and direction.  Previously, this effect had hampered our ability to fully exploit wide-band observations, but no more!\n\nThrough simulations, we showcase the power of this approach, demonstrating its ability to unveil signals from extremely strong magnetic fields that were once hidden from view. This breakthrough is especially relevant for low-frequency, wide-band observations, opening up a treasure trove of new data for studying the most extreme environments in the Universe.\n\nBut wait, there's more! We've taken these ideas even further by introducing a technique akin to \"mosaicking\" in Faraday depth, allowing us to seamlessly stitch together data from multiple telescopes. This exciting development promises to revolutionize polarimetric science, yielding magnetic field maps of unprecedented quality and detail.\n\nThe future of cosmic magnetism research is bright! With these new tools in hand, we are poised to unravel the secrets of magnetic fields surrounding pulsars, Fast Radio Bursts, and other extreme objects, ultimately utilizing them as probes to chart the vast magnetic fields that thread the fabric of our Universe. \n", "This study compares different statistical models in their ability to describe the production of charged particles in high-energy collisions between hadrons and atomic nuclei.  We utilize four distinct probability distributions: the Negative Binomial, shifted Gompertz, Weibull, and Krasznovszky-Wagner distributions. Each of these models offers a unique mathematical framework, some based on empirical parameterizations and others rooted in theoretical descriptions of the underlying physics.  \n\nBy comparing the model predictions with experimental data, we assess their relative successes in capturing the characteristic features of particle production. Our analysis focuses on a range of physical observables, providing insights into the strengths and limitations of each statistical approach for understanding particle production in high-energy nuclear collisions. \n", "Imagine a cloud of data points scattered in multi-dimensional space. How do you define the \"deepest\" point within this cloud, a point that best represents its center?  This question lies at the heart of data depth, a powerful concept in statistics pioneered by John Tukey and further developed by David Donoho and Miriam Gasko.\n\nTukey's idea was simple yet elegant: the deepest point is the one most surrounded by other data points. Donoho and Gasko formalized this notion by considering all possible hyperplanes (think of lines in 2D, planes in 3D, and their higher-dimensional counterparts) passing through a given point.  The depth of this point is determined by the smallest fraction of data points that can be separated from it by any such hyperplane. \n\nThis intuitive concept of data depth has blossomed into a rich field of statistical methods.  Numerous depth functions have been proposed, each with its strengths and weaknesses in terms of computational complexity, robustness to outliers, and sensitivity to asymmetries in the data distribution. \n\nA particularly useful application of data depth lies in constructing \"depth-trimmed regions.\" These regions are defined as sets of points with depth exceeding a certain threshold, providing a visual and quantitative representation of the data's center, spread, and overall shape. The innermost region serves as a generalization of the median to higher dimensions.\n\nThe concept of data depth extends beyond mere data clouds to encompass general probability distributions, enabling theoretical analysis and the establishment of rigorous statistical properties.  Moreover, it has been successfully generalized to handle complex data objects residing in function spaces, such as curves and surfaces.\n\nData depth has become an indispensable tool for exploring and analyzing complex data sets, offering a powerful way to uncover hidden patterns, detect outliers, and gain insights into the underlying structure of data.\n", "Strain engineering, the fine art of manipulating a material's properties by stretching or compressing its atomic lattice, holds immense potential for crafting next-generation optoelectronic devices. This is particularly relevant for SiGe nanostructures, which are highly sensitive to strain.\n\nThis study unveils a novel strategy for achieving large tensile strain in SiGe nanostructures, paving the way for enhanced device performance.  Our approach leverages lateral confinement by the silicon substrate itself, eliminating the need for external stressors and offering significant advantages in terms of scalability and fabrication simplicity.\n\nWe focus on Ge-rich SiGe nano-stripes, meticulously crafted using advanced epitaxial growth techniques. To probe their strain state with unprecedented detail, we employ a powerful combination of experimental and theoretical tools.\n\nTip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, a technique that combines the spatial precision of atomic force microscopy with the sensitivity of Raman spectroscopy, allows us to map the strain distribution within these nano-stripes with a remarkable lateral resolution of approximately 30 nanometers.  Our measurements reveal a striking pattern: a large tensile hydrostatic strain component concentrated at the center of the top surface, gradually diminishing towards the edges.\n\nThis strain distribution is further confirmed and explained through finite element method simulations, which provide a comprehensive picture of the mechanical stresses and strains within the nano-stripe.  The simulations highlight the key role of the lateral constraint imposed by the substrate sidewalls, which inhibits relaxation in the out-of-plane direction. This confinement, coupled with the inherent misfit strain between SiGe and Si, leads to the observed tensile strain enhancement.\n\nBut how does this strain impact the material's electronic properties? To answer this, we turn to X-ray photoelectron emission microscopy, a technique that allows us to map the work function \u2013 a key parameter governing electron emission \u2013 with a spatial resolution better than 100 nanometers.  Our measurements reveal a positive work function shift in the nano-stripes compared to bulk SiGe, indicating a modification of the electronic band structure due to the applied strain.\n\nThese experimental observations are corroborated by ab initio electronic structure calculations, which provide a theoretical underpinning for the observed work function shift.  Our calculations confirm that tensile strain directly modifies the electronic band structure of SiGe, impacting its optoelectronic properties.\n\nThis study establishes a novel and scalable route to achieving high tensile strain in SiGe nanostructures, opening exciting avenues for developing high-performance optoelectronic devices with tailored properties.  \n\n\n", "Imagine a race against time to combat a global pandemic.  Sharing vital medical data and insights across borders could be the key to developing life-saving treatments and containment strategies. However, directly applying one region's data or models to another often stumbles due to subtle but significant differences in disease presentation, healthcare practices, or population demographics \u2013 a challenge known as distribution shift.\n\nThis research delves into the potential of deep transfer learning, a cutting-edge machine learning technique, to overcome this hurdle and unlock the full potential of global data collaboration during pandemics. We put two powerful data-based algorithms (domain-adversarial neural networks and maximum classifier discrepancy) and model-based transfer learning to the test, challenging them with infectious disease detection tasks.\n\nTo truly understand their strengths and limitations, we crafted realistic synthetic scenarios mimicking the real-world complexities of data distribution shifts between regions.  Our findings reveal a powerful synergy between data availability and transfer learning efficacy:\n\n* When the source and target regions exhibit similarities, and the target region has limited labeled training data, transfer learning emerges as a game-changer, significantly boosting disease detection accuracy.\n* In situations where the target region lacks labeled training data entirely, model-based transfer learning takes center stage, showcasing impressive performance comparable to data-based approaches.\n\nIntriguingly, our results highlight the critical need to dissect and understand the nuances of real-world data distribution shifts, paving the way for even more effective transfer learning strategies.  This research underscores the immense potential of transfer learning to unlock a new era of global health collaboration, where data transcends borders to combat infectious diseases with unprecedented speed and precision. \n", "Here are the key points from the text, formatted as a bullet list:\n\n* This research focuses on the study of quasi-bound states in the continuum (quasi-BICs) in simple dielectric structures, specifically during the transition from a solid cylinder to a thin ring. \n* The study reveals a crossover behavior of quasi-BICs from a strong-coupling to a weak-coupling regime as the inner radius of the cylinder increases.\n* This crossover is marked by a transition from avoided crossing of resonant branches to their intersection, with the quasi-BIC persisting only on a single, straight branch.\n* In the strong-coupling regime, the far-field radiation pattern arises from the interference of three waves: two from the resonant modes and one from the overall scattering of the structure.\n* This three-wave interference challenges the conventional understanding of Fano resonance, which typically applies to weak-coupling scenarios involving only two-wave interference. \n", "When temperature variations meet turbulent flows, an intriguing phenomenon known as turbulent thermal diffusion emerges, particularly impacting the movement of small particles. This effect generates a non-diffusive transport of particles, essentially pushing them along the direction of the turbulent heat flux. The strength of this unusual particle flux depends on the average particle concentration and a characteristic velocity determined by the particles' inertia.\n\nPrevious theoretical descriptions of this phenomenon were limited to scenarios with small temperature gradients and low particle inertia (characterized by the Stokes number).  This study presents a comprehensive theoretical framework that extends to arbitrary temperature gradients and Stokes numbers, allowing for the analysis of a much broader range of turbulent flows.\n\nWe conducted laboratory experiments using both oscillating grid turbulence and multi-fan generated turbulence to rigorously test our generalized theory. These experiments confirmed the theoretical predictions, demonstrating that in turbulent flows with strong temperature stratification:\n\n- The characteristic velocity of inertial particles remains lower than the typical vertical turbulent velocity at high Reynolds numbers.\n- Both the effective particle velocity and the turbulent thermal diffusion coefficient increase with increasing particle inertia up to a certain point (small Stokes numbers), after which they begin to decline.\n-  Larger temperature gradients lead to a reduction in the effectiveness of turbulent thermal diffusion.\n\nThe strong agreement between our experimental observations and the predictions of our generalized theory provides a powerful tool for understanding and predicting particle transport in a wide array of turbulent flows with temperature variations, from industrial processes to atmospheric and oceanic flows. \n", "Understanding the intricate details of pulsar radio emission has challenged astronomers for decades. A prevailing model, the rotating vector model (RVM), simplifies this challenge by assuming that the emission originates from a narrow cone around a rotating magnetic field line, always tangent to the line of sight. While insightful, this model is an approximation.\n\nOur study revisits a more precise treatment, the \"tangent model,\" which acknowledges that the point of emission on the magnetic field line actually shifts with the pulsar's rotation. This shift traces a distinct trajectory on a sphere of radius \"r.\"\n\nWe delve into the geometric intricacies of this model, deriving expressions for both the trajectory of the emission point and its angular velocity. This investigation is particularly timely given recent claims suggesting that this motion might be observable using the novel technique of interstellar holography (Pen et al. 2014).\n\nOur analysis quantifies the discrepancies between the simplified RVM and the more accurate tangent model.  We find that for pulsars exhibiting emission over a broad rotational phase range, the RVM can significantly underestimate the true extent of visible emission.\n\nFurthermore, our findings imply that, based on geometric arguments alone, visible pulsar radio emission likely originates at altitudes exceeding ten percent of the light-cylinder distance.  This intriguing finding underscores the limitations of neglecting retardation effects, particularly at such significant distances from the pulsar. \n", "Imagine trying to teach a computer to recognize new things it's never seen before. That's the challenge of zero-shot learning (ZSL) in image recognition.  It's like teaching a child what a \"zebra\" looks like by showing them pictures of horses and telling them about stripes!\n\nThe trick is to use descriptions, or \"semantic information,\" about the objects. Our new approach, the Global Semantic Consistency Network (GSC-Net), takes full advantage of these descriptions for both known and unknown objects, making it a whiz at zero-shot learning!\n\nThink of it like this: GSC-Net learns a common language between images and descriptions. It uses this language to recognize even those objects it hasn't seen before, just by understanding their descriptions.\n\nWe've also taught GSC-Net to be extra clever by understanding relationships between different objects.  For example, it knows that \"zebra\" is closer to \"horse\" than \"table.\"\n\nTo make GSC-Net even more practical, we added a special feature: a \"novelty detector.\" This helps it deal with situations where it needs to identify both known and unknown objects in the mix, like figuring out if that striped animal is a horse or a zebra.\n\nWe put GSC-Net to the test on three challenging datasets and it aced every single one!  It outperformed all other methods, proving that understanding the language of descriptions is key to unlocking the power of zero-shot learning. \n\n\n", "There's a common belief that category theory, a branch of math focused on relationships and patterns, naturally supports the idea of mathematical structuralism. Structuralism, broadly speaking, suggests that math is all about understanding abstract structures rather than specific objects.\n\nHowever, this paper argues that this view is mistaken. While structural math deals with unchanging forms, category theory is all about transformations -  changes and relationships that don't always have fixed points of reference.\n\nInstead of supporting structuralism, this paper proposes a different philosophical interpretation of category theory: one that emphasizes the dynamic and interconnected nature of mathematical concepts.\n\nThis new perspective has important implications for how we understand the historical development of math and how we teach it effectively. By focusing on the transformative aspects of category theory, we can gain a deeper appreciation for the evolving nature of mathematical thinking. \n\n\n", "This study explores a novel approach to information processing using the intriguing properties of exciton-polariton condensates. Exciton-polaritons, quasiparticles arising from the strong coupling of light and matter within semiconductor microcavities, can form macroscopic quantum states known as condensates. These condensates exhibit fascinating phenomena, including the formation of quantized vortices \u2013 tiny whirlpools of polariton flow carrying topological charge.\n\nWe theoretically demonstrate that in a non-equilibrium exciton-polariton condensate driven by incoherent pumping, a ring-shaped pump spot can create stable vortex states with topological charges of +1 or -1. These vortex states act as robust memory elements, storing information encoded in their topological charge.\n\nFurthermore, we show that by strategically placing potential barriers within the condensate, we can control the flow of these vortices and even copy or invert their topological charges onto spatially separated ring pumps. This ability to manipulate topological charges offers a new paradigm for information processing, where information is encoded in robust, topologically protected vortex states. \n\nThis research paves the way for exploring novel computing architectures based on the unique properties of exciton-polariton condensates, potentially leading to faster and more energy-efficient information processing technologies.\n", "The LOFT mission, vying for the European Space Agency's coveted M3 launch opportunity, underwent a rigorous three-year assessment phase to evaluate its technological readiness. A crucial aspect of this assessment involved characterizing the potential impact of space radiation on the mission's silicon drift detectors (SDDs), responsible for capturing vital X-ray data.\n\nOur team meticulously subjected these detectors to a barrage of radiation, simulating the harsh conditions of space.  We exposed the SDDs to high-energy protons (0.8 and 11 MeV) to quantify the detrimental effects of displacement damage, meticulously measuring the resulting increase in leakage current and any degradation in charge collection efficiency.\n\nFurthermore, we simulated the impact of hypervelocity dust grains, mimicking the constant bombardment by micrometeoroids in space. This allowed us to assess the robustness of the SDDs against these potentially destructive events.\n\nThis paper provides a comprehensive overview of our experimental findings, contextualizing their implications for the LOFT mission's overall performance and longevity in the unforgiving environment of space. \n", "This study investigates the efficacy of incorporating low-level multimodal features into content-based movie recommendation systems.  We posit that leveraging information from textual, audio, and visual modalities, in conjunction with traditional metadata, can enhance the accuracy of movie similarity assessments.\n\nOur approach centers on developing robust multimodal representation models for movies. In the textual domain, we employ topic modeling techniques applied to movie subtitles, extracting thematic representations that discriminate effectively between movies. For the visual domain, we extract semantically salient features characterizing camera motion, color palettes, and facial information.  Audio analysis leverages pre-trained models to derive meaningful classification aggregates.\n\nThese multimodal features are then integrated with standard movie metadata (e.g., directors, actors) to create a comprehensive content representation. To evaluate our approach, we constructed a dataset comprising 160 well-known movies and implemented a content-based recommendation system that generates ranked lists of similar movies based on various feature combinations.\n\nOur experiments demonstrate that incorporating low-level features from all three modalities (textual, audio, and visual) significantly enhances recommendation performance compared to relying solely on metadata. Notably, we observe a relative increase in performance exceeding 50% across multiple evaluation metrics. \n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to leverage such a diverse range of low-level multimodal features to augment content similarity estimation in movie recommendation, surpassing the limitations of traditional metadata-driven approaches. \n", "Imagine a cosmic dance between gravity and quantum mechanics, playing out at the edge of a black hole.  We embark on a journey to understand how these titans of physics interact, focusing on the enigmatic radiation emitted by black holes as they slowly evaporate into the cosmos.\n\nOur stage is a charged Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole, a more intricate cousin of the classic Schwarzschild black hole. Armed with the tools of quantum gravity, we embark on a quest to solve a fundamental equation known as the Wheeler-De Witt equation. This equation, a cornerstone of quantum cosmology, governs the very fabric of spacetime.\n\nOur journey takes us through three distinct regions:\n\nFirst, we explore the familiar territory between the event horizon, the point of no return, and the vast expanse of spacetime. Here, our calculations reveal a fascinating result: the rate at which the black hole sheds its mass through thermal radiation perfectly matches the predictions of classical physics, providing a reassuring consistency between the quantum and classical worlds.\n\nNext, we venture into the heart of the black hole, delving into the region between the singularity, a point of infinite density, and the inner horizon, a boundary cloaked in mystery. To our surprise, the same equation yields the same answer \u2013 the black hole's mass loss rate remains consistent, hinting at an unexpected harmony even in the most extreme corners of the universe.\n\nFinally, we navigate the treacherous territory between the inner and outer horizons, a region where spacetime itself twists and turns in bizarre ways.  Remarkably, even here, the equation holds firm, revealing a consistent picture of black hole evaporation across all realms.\n\nThis work is more than just a mathematical exercise; it's a testament to the power of quantum gravity to illuminate even the darkest corners of the cosmos.  By demonstrating the consistency of black hole radiation across different spacetime regions, we gain a deeper understanding of how gravity and quantum mechanics intertwine to shape the universe we inhabit. \n", "Imagine a vast cosmic tapestry, woven with billions of galaxies, each a swirling island of stars, gas, and dust. Now, envision teaching a machine to see this tapestry through the eyes of an astronomer, distinguishing between the elegant ellipses of early-type galaxies, the majestic spiral arms of their younger counterparts, and the deceptively compact points of light emanating from distant quasars or artifacts of our telescopes.\n\nThis study embarks on this ambitious task, employing the power of machine learning to decipher the language of galactic morphology. We train an artificial neural network, a versatile algorithm inspired by the human brain, on a subset of objects from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) that have been meticulously categorized by citizen scientists participating in the Galaxy Zoo project.\n\nOur goal is to determine whether this artificial apprentice can learn to replicate the discerning eye of its human mentors. We find that the neural network's success hinges critically on the information it receives - the set of input parameters chosen to characterize each galaxy.\n\nFeeding the network with basic colors and profile measurements allows it to make rudimentary distinctions, but its performance flourishes when presented with a richer palette of information.  Adding parameters that capture the subtle textures, asymmetric quirks, and concentrated cores of galaxies proves to be a revelation, significantly boosting the network's accuracy.\n\nIntriguingly, we discover that certain combinations of parameters, while powerful, have limitations.  For instance, relying solely on shapes, textures, and concentrations can leave the network struggling to differentiate between smooth, featureless early-type galaxies and the compact dots of point sources.\n\nHowever, with a carefully selected set of twelve parameters, the neural network truly shines, replicating the human classifications with an impressive accuracy exceeding 90% for all three galaxy types.  Remarkably, this performance holds even when the training data is incomplete, showcasing the robustness of our approach.\n\nOur findings underscore the immense potential of machine learning to transform how we analyze the vast datasets emerging from next-generation sky surveys. With the Galaxy Zoo catalogue as an invaluable training ground, these algorithms promise to become essential tools for astronomers, enabling us to unravel the mysteries of galaxy evolution and map the cosmos with unprecedented detail. \n", "The Lambek calculus, a logical system inspired by the structure of natural language, has been a cornerstone for modeling syntax, particularly in the realm of context-free languages. However, the intricacies of real-world language often demand a more expressive framework.\n\nMorrill and Valentin (2015) addressed this need by introducing an extension to the Lambek calculus, incorporating \"exponential\" and \"bracket\" modalities. These additions aim to capture complex linguistic phenomena involving dependencies and discontinuities that reach beyond context-free grammars.  Their system, however, relies on a non-standard contraction rule, deviating from the typical behavior of logical systems.\n\nThis paper delves into the computational properties of this extended Lambek calculus, focusing on the \"derivability problem\" \u2013 determining whether a given linguistic structure can be derived within the system.\n\nOur primary finding reveals that, in its full generality, the derivability problem in this extended calculus is undecidable. This implies that no single algorithm can effectively determine the derivability of all possible expressions within this system, highlighting its computational complexity.\n\nHowever, we don't stop there.  We further investigate specific fragments of this calculus, previously identified by Morrill and Valentin, where the derivability problem becomes decidable. We prove that these decidable fragments belong to the NP complexity class. This classification provides valuable insights into the computational resources required to solve the derivability problem within these restricted yet expressive fragments.\n\n\n", "Previous studies suggested that the phase transition in 4D Euclidean Dynamical Triangulation (EDT) is first-order, contradicting earlier beliefs of a second-order transition. However, these studies relied on numerical methods that might have influenced the results.\n\nWe address these concerns by employing improved simulation techniques: allowing volume fluctuations, measuring after a fixed number of attempted moves, and mitigating critical slowing down using an optimized parallel tempering algorithm.  Our findings, based on systems significantly larger than those previously studied, confirm the first-order nature of the phase transition.\n\nFurthermore, we introduce a local criterion for distinguishing between different phases within a triangulation and establish a novel correspondence between EDT and the \"balls in boxes\" model. This correspondence leads to a refined partition function with an additional coupling constant. \n\nFinally, we propose modifications to the path-integral measure that could potentially eliminate the observed metastability and drive the EDT system towards a second-order transition. \n", "This work delves into the intersection of geometric group theory and theoretical computer science, focusing on the delicate interplay between a group's growth properties and the decidability of its Domino Problem.  The Domino Problem, a classic question in computability theory, asks whether there exists an algorithm to determine if a given set of tiles can tile the plane, subject to certain matching rules.\n\nWe provide a complete characterization of finitely generated groups exhibiting virtually nilpotent growth (or equivalently, by Gromov's celebrated theorem, groups of polynomial growth) for which the Domino Problem admits a decision algorithm.  Our findings reveal a strikingly elegant dichotomy: the only such groups are those that are virtually free, encompassing finite groups and groups containing the integers ($\\mathbb{Z}$) as a subgroup of finite index.  This result establishes a deep connection between the algebraic structure of a group and its combinatorial tiling properties.\n", "Indirect detection, seeking telltale signatures of dark matter interactions in the cosmos, stands as a pillar in our quest to understand this elusive component of the universe.  Among these cosmic messengers, gamma rays produced by the annihilation of dark matter particles in the galactic halo shine particularly bright.\n\nThis study unveils the significant potential of spectral features imprinted on these gamma-ray signals to dramatically enhance our ability to not only detect dark matter but also decipher its fundamental nature. Unlike the smooth, featureless gamma-ray spectra expected at lower energies, many dark matter models predict pronounced spectral features near the mass energy of the dark matter particle. These features act as unique fingerprints, providing invaluable clues about the particle's properties and interactions.\n\nWe conduct a comprehensive analysis of the sensitivity of gamma-ray telescopes to such spectral features, including the well-studied case of line signals arising from the direct annihilation of dark matter particles into photons.  Our results demonstrate that these spectral features offer a powerful probe, significantly surpassing the sensitivity offered by broad, model-independent spectral analyses at lower energies.\n\nFurthermore, we derive projected limits on the strength of these spectral features, setting stringent constraints on various dark matter models.  These projected limits underscore the power of focusing on these unique signatures, paving the way for a deeper understanding of dark matter and its role in the universe.\n\n\n", "Achieving carbon neutrality in the electricity sector requires not only adopting renewable energy sources like wind and solar, but also tackling the operational challenges they bring to the power grid.  As we increase the share of these variable renewable energy (VRE) sources, balancing electricity supply and demand becomes increasingly complex. \n\nThis paper outlines the key research priorities for managing a grid dominated by VRE. We highlight the need for advancements in:\n\n* **Grid Planning and Operation:** Designing systems that can handle the fluctuating nature of VRE and optimizing their operation in real-time.\n* **Grid Stability:** Ensuring the grid remains stable despite the intermittent nature of VRE.\n* **Energy Storage and Demand Response:**  Integrating energy storage solutions and enabling demand-side participation to balance supply and demand.\n* **Decentralized Control:**  Developing distributed control and estimation strategies for managing a more complex and dynamic grid.\n* **Energy Sector Coupling:**  Analyzing the interactions between the electricity sector and other energy sectors (e.g., heating, transportation) in a carbon-neutral system. \n\nWe identify existing research gaps in these areas and showcase our recent studies that contribute to filling them, particularly regarding improved grid operation and real-time estimation techniques. We also provide practical case studies demonstrating the stability and economic viability of high-VRE grids, offering valuable insights for stakeholders navigating the transition to a carbon-neutral future. \n", "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are all the rage in computer vision, gobbling up tons of data to learn how to recognize images.  But here's the catch: the better they get, the bigger and more memory-hungry they become!\n\nWe're tackling this problem with our cool new invention: Frequency-Sensitive Hashed Nets (FreshNets). Think of it like a super-efficient compression algorithm for CNNs. \n\nHere's the gist:  we noticed that the learned filters in CNNs are usually smooth and don't change too abruptly.  So, we use a neat trick called the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to analyze these filters in the frequency domain.  Then, we use a simple hash function to randomly group similar frequencies together.\n\nThe magic happens next:  instead of storing separate values for each frequency, we make them share a single value, which the network learns during training. It's like having a giant potluck where everyone brings the same dish, saving a ton of space and resources!\n\nTo squeeze out even more efficiency, we prioritize the important, low-frequency stuff, giving them more \"hash buckets\" than the less-important high-frequency components. \n\nWe tested FreshNets on eight different datasets, and guess what?  It crushed the competition!  Our networks were drastically smaller and still performed like champs, proving that you can teach a CNN to be both smart and efficient. \n", "We know that diving into the world of software development can feel daunting, especially when it comes to the often-overlooked, yet crucial stage of Requirements Development.

By incorporating the subtle yet profound effects of quantum gravity, we reveal a mechanism that could halt the evaporation process, leaving behind a tantalizing remnant.\n\nFocusing on a 5-dimensional rotating black string, a fascinating object in theoretical physics, we analyze the quantum tunneling of fermions \u2013 the building blocks of matter. Our calculations demonstrate that the black string's temperature, a key factor governing its evaporation rate, is not solely determined by its properties.  Instead, it is profoundly influenced by the quantum characteristics of the emitted particles and the presence of an extra spatial dimension.\n\nCrucially, these quantum corrections act as a cosmic brake, slowing down the black string's temperature increase as it radiates energy. This intriguing interplay between gravity and quantum mechanics naturally leads to the formation of a remnant, a small but potentially profound object that defies complete evaporation.  This discovery has profound implications for our understanding of black holes, quantum gravity, and the ultimate fate of these enigmatic objects in the universe. \n", "This work explores a novel perspective on word representations, challenging the conventional reliance on first-order embeddings alone. We introduce a new approach: capturing the essence of a word by examining its neighborhood in a pre-trained contextual embedding space.  This method allows us to construct second-order vector representations, encoding not only a word's individual meaning but also its relationship to semantically similar words.\n\nSurprisingly, we find that this localized neighborhood information encapsulates much of the power attributed to pre-trained word embeddings.  When used as input features for deep learning models tackling natural language tasks like named entity recognition and textual entailment, second-order embeddings demonstrate impressive performance, often rivaling their first-order counterparts.\n\nOur investigation reveals a compelling trade-off: second-order embeddings excel in handling diverse and heterogeneous data, demonstrating greater adaptability at the cost of some specificity compared to first-order representations.  Furthermore, we observe intriguing synergies when augmenting contextual embeddings with these second-order features, leading to further performance enhancements in certain tasks.\n\nOur findings also highlight the inherent randomness in embedding initialization.  By leveraging nearest neighbor information from multiple instances of first-order embeddings, we uncover a potential avenue for boosting downstream performance, suggesting that ensemble approaches could be particularly fruitful.\n\nThis exploration into the realm of second-order embeddings unveils rich and underexplored characteristics.  Their increased density and the nuanced semantic interpretation of cosine similarity within these spaces offer fertile ground for future research, promising a deeper understanding of word representations and their role in shaping intelligent language processing systems. \n", "Imagine a world where wireless signals can navigate around obstacles and reach even the most challenging corners of your home. That's the promise of millimeter wave (mmWave) technology, powered by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) \u2013 think of them like smart mirrors that can redirect and focus wireless beams.\n\nBut here's a cool bonus:  not only can these RIS-aided systems deliver super-fast internet, they can also pinpoint your location with remarkable accuracy! It's like having a built-in GPS, even indoors.\n\nHow does it work?  By cleverly analyzing the subtle ways in which wireless signals bounce off the RIS and reach your device, we can extract precise information about your surroundings. Think of it like a virtual echolocation system.\n\nHowever, dealing with the massive amounts of data generated by these systems can be tricky. That's where our research comes in. We've developed a smarter way to process these signals using a technique called multidimensional orthogonal matching pursuit. \n\nImagine trying to find a specific grain of sand on a beach. Instead of searching aimlessly, our method divides the beach into smaller sections and looks for clues in each section independently. This makes the search much faster and more efficient, allowing us to pinpoint your location with remarkable precision.\n\nOur simulations of a realistic indoor environment show that this approach significantly improves localization accuracy in RIS-aided mmWave systems. This opens up exciting possibilities for a wide range of applications, from indoor navigation and augmented reality to smart homes and beyond! \n\n\n", "Protecting sensitive information from leaking through subtle timing side channels is crucial for maintaining confidentiality. While static analysis methods are commonly used to detect these leaks, they struggle to handle the complexity of real-world applications and often provide only \"yes\" or \"no\" answers regarding the presence of a leak. \n\nThis paper introduces a powerful dynamic analysis technique that overcomes these limitations. Our approach tackles the challenge of timing side-channel analysis in two stages.  First, we train a neural network to learn the program's timing behavior, capturing the subtle relationships between execution time and secret information.  \n\nNext, we analyze this learned timing model to not only detect potential leaks but also quantify their severity, providing a more nuanced understanding of the potential threat. Our experimental results demonstrate that both stages of our approach are practically feasible, offering significant advantages over existing methods.\n\nThe success of our technique rests on two key innovations: a specialized neural network architecture designed to uncover timing side channels and an efficient algorithm based on Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) for quantifying the strength of these leaks.  \n\nWe showcase the effectiveness of our method through extensive evaluation on a range of benchmarks and real-world applications.

It's the primary source of chondritic meteorites and near-Earth asteroids, making it crucial for understanding the early solar system and potential threats to Earth.\n\nAsteroids in this region face a gravitational obstacle course. Bounded by a secular resonance and Jupiter's powerful 1:3 mean motion resonance, large asteroids (diameter > 30 km) struggle to escape unless their orbits intersect Mars' path, allowing for gravitational scattering.  \n\nOur study focuses on the chaotic effects of Mars' gravity on asteroids near its 1:2 mean motion resonance.  We find that while this chaotic dance increases the spread of asteroid orbital eccentricities and inclinations, it doesn't significantly shift their average values. Interestingly, while the 1:2 resonance initially amplifies this chaotic scattering, at high eccentricities it acts as a protective barrier, shielding asteroids from close encounters with Mars and extending their lifetime within the belt. \n\nHowever, our most significant finding is that gravitational forces alone, even those amplified by the 1:2 resonance, cannot explain the observed distribution of asteroid eccentricities.  This suggests that non-gravitational forces, such as the Yarkovsky effect (where sunlight subtly nudges an asteroid's orbit), likely play a crucial role in driving asteroids out of the inner belt and towards Earth. \n", "The quest to unravel the mysteries of neutrinos, those elusive particles that hold the key to physics beyond the Standard Model, is hindered by the presence of non-standard interactions (NSI).  These interactions, if they exist, could significantly impact the precision measurements at upcoming neutrino oscillation experiments.  \n\nThis research highlights a compelling and complementary approach to pin down the elusive NSI parameters: leveraging the power of electron-positron colliders.

The absence of detectable BELs in systems with black hole masses below 10^5 solar masses, as observed in SDSS data, raises a crucial question: do such low-mass AGNs truly not exist, or are their BELs too faint to be detected?\n\nWe address this question by systematically calculating the expected equivalent widths (EWs) of prominent ultraviolet and optical emission lines (Ly\u03b1, H\u03b2, CIV, MgII) for a wide range of black hole masses, spanning 10 to 10^9 solar masses. Our calculations employ the Locally Optimally Emitting Cloud (LOC) model to characterize the BEL region (BELR) and utilize realistic ionizing spectral energy distributions (SEDs) tailored to different black hole masses.\n\nContrary to expectations, we find that the hardening of the SED with decreasing black hole mass does not diminish the BEL EWs. Instead, the primary factor governing BEL detectability is the size of the BELR, which correlates with black hole mass. \n\nOur results reveal a peak in BEL EWs for black hole masses around 10^8 solar masses, characteristic of typical AGNs.  Below this mass, BEL EWs decrease sharply, dropping significantly below detection thresholds for masses below 10^6 solar masses. This intrinsic faintness of BELs in low-mass AGNs provides a compelling explanation for their apparent absence in current SDSS observations. \n", "Get this - we've achieved super-precise synchronization in wireless networks using the awesome power of pulse-coupled oscillators!

That's the challenge of optimization, and Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful tool for navigating this complex terrain.\n\nTraditional BO algorithms operate on a fixed budget of steps, assuming each step has the same cost. But what if the cost varies depending on where you are in this landscape?  Imagine traversing treacherous mountains where each step is arduous and time-consuming, compared to strolling across open plains. \n\nCost-aware BO methods tackle this challenge by considering not just the number of steps but also their individual costs, measured in terms of time, energy, or even money.  Our new approach, Cost Apportioned BO (CArBO), is a master navigator in this cost-conscious world.\n\nCArBO starts by strategically exploring the landscape, focusing on cost-effective initial steps to gain a quick understanding of the terrain.

As we heat this delicate molecule or gently pull on its ends, it undergoes a fascinating transformation, contorting and folding like a microscopic origami masterpiece.  This intricate dance between folded and unfolded states is governed by the formation of loops, tiny bends in the strand that hold the key to its structure and function.\n\nWe've developed a theoretical model that captures this mesmerizing dance, taking into account the subtle energetic cost of forming loops.  Our model reveals a remarkable phase transition, a tipping point where the molecule abruptly shifts between a compact, folded state and a loose, unfolded state, driven by changes in temperature and applied force.\n\nOur findings uncover a hidden world of critical exponents and universal scaling laws, revealing how the size and frequency of loops dramatically influence the molecule's behavior. We discover a critical threshold for loop formation:  only within a narrow range of loop exponents can the molecule transition between folded and unfolded states through changes in temperature alone.\n\nBut the story doesn't end there. Applying a gentle force to the molecule can trigger this unfolding transition for a wider range of loop exponents, a phenomenon readily observable through single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments.\n\nOur insights extend beyond single strands to illuminate the dance of two strands intertwined in a DNA double helix.  Challenging the traditional Poland-Scheraga model of DNA melting, we demonstrate that the formation of loops within single strands can significantly alter the stability of the double helix, leading to lower melting temperatures than previously predicted.  \n\nThis deeper understanding of loop formation reshapes our view of DNA and RNA behavior, offering new avenues for exploring the fundamental processes governing life's blueprint. \n\n\n", "Imagine a tiny wire, thinner than a human hair, etched onto a crystal of gallium arsenide.

Specifically, we consider algebras represented over complex Hilbert spaces that possess two self-adjoint involutions and an anti-unitary operator satisfying specific commutation relations.  By analogy with Clifford algebras on even-dimensional vector spaces, we assign a pair of spatial and temporal dimensions modulo 8 to each such algebra.\n\nA key feature of this assignment is its compatibility with the tensor product operation: the spacetime dimensions of a tensor product algebra are simply the sums of the dimensions of its constituent factors. This property offers a potential interpretation for the prevalence of such algebras in diverse physical contexts, including PT-symmetric Hamiltonians and the description of topological matter.\n\nFurthermore, we leverage this construction to develop an indefinite, pseudo-Riemannian generalization of spectral triples, fundamental objects in noncommutative geometry.  Our approach replaces the traditional Hilbert space framework with Krein spaces, naturally accommodating indefinite inner products.  This enables us to express the Lagrangian, encompassing both bosonic and fermionic terms, for Lorentzian almost-commutative spectral triples.\n\nRemarkably, we identify a space of physical states within this framework that elegantly resolves the long-standing fermion-doubling problem.

While numerical simulations have illuminated the importance of these fields, especially the magnetorotational instability (MRI), integrating these insights into practical models for comparison with observations remains a compelling challenge.\n\nThis paper champions the need to more accurately incorporate non-local transport processes into these models. We revisit the classic Shakura-Sunyaev (1973) approach, highlighting its inherent nature as a mean-field theory and its limitations in capturing large-scale transport.\n\nObservations of coronae and jets, alongside interpretations of even local shearing box simulations of the MRI, strongly suggest that a substantial fraction of angular momentum transport within accretion disks is non-local. We delve into the intricate physics of MRI-driven transport, demonstrating that Maxwell stresses in the saturated state are dominated by large-scale contributions, challenging the traditional notion of a simple viscosity-based description.\n\nLooking forward, the next generation of global simulations holds immense potential for informing and refining mean-field theories.  We envision a unified framework that seamlessly integrates mean-field accretion and dynamo theories, enabling us to predict the time evolution of spectra and luminosity from individual contributions of the disk, corona, and outflow.\n\nFinally, we emphasize the importance of quantifying the inherent predictive limitations of any mean-field theory.

But they have a bit of a memory problem: they need to store a ton of information about every single element in the sequence, which can make them slow and inefficient when dealing with really long sequences.\n\nThat's where our new model, Memformer, comes in. It's like giving a transformer an external hard drive to store all those memories! Instead of keeping everything in its internal memory, Memformer cleverly encodes and retrieves information from this external dynamic memory.\n\nThis means that even when processing super long sequences, Memformer can keep up, running much faster and using way less memory.  We also developed a special training method called \"memory replay back-propagation\" (MRBP).  This helps Memformer learn long-range dependencies in the data without hogging all the memory.\n\nWe put Memformer to the test and it performed just as well as existing models, but using 8 times less memory and running 3 times faster!

Yet, a hidden danger lurks within this powerful paradigm: the insidious allure of the background scene.  \n\nCurrent approaches naively pit video clips against each other, forcing the model to distinguish between them.  But this strategy often backfires, leading the model astray.  The stark differences in scenes, like a bustling city versus a serene forest, overshadow the more subtle nuances of motion, leaving the model fixated on static backgrounds instead of the dynamic dance of actions.\n\nThis paper unveils a bold new approach, a dual contrastive learning framework that shatters the tyranny of the background scene.  We dissect the visual tapestry of video, teasing apart the static and dynamic elements that intertwine within.\n\nImagine splitting the essence of a video into two complementary streams: one capturing the timeless backdrop, the other pulsating with the rhythm of motion.

Using a combination of cutting-edge computational techniques (FLAPW and LSDA+U methods), we've successfully calculated its electronic bandstructure and Fermi surfaces.\n\nOne of the most intriguing findings is the nature of the ground state for the 4f electrons in this material.  Our calculations suggest a novel scenario:  a fully orbital- and spin-polarized state, where the electrons occupy a specific orbital and spin configuration (|lz=0, sx=1/2>). This challenges the conventional expectation of a ground state dominated by the typical LS coupling observed in many other materials containing 4f electrons.\n\nWhat's even more encouraging is that this unconventional ground state beautifully explains experimental observations! Both the measured magnetic moment and the de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) oscillation frequencies align perfectly with our theoretical predictions. \n\nOur analysis suggests that this unique ground state arises from a strong \"direct mixing\" interaction between the 4f electrons of neighboring cerium (Ce) atoms.

These are not mere buzzwords; they are essential goals for building fair and inclusive evaluation tools.\n\nWe equip researchers with a powerful toolkit, a suite of methods and statistical tests, to rigorously assess the performance of metrics in light of these goals. Our analysis reveals a stark truth: current state-of-the-art metrics are woefully inadequate when it comes to dialect robustness.  Shockingly, we discover that introducing dialect features often results in larger penalties than introducing outright semantic errors.\n\nThis unsettling finding underscores the urgent need for change. As a first step towards a more equitable future, we propose NANO, a novel training scheme that infuses regional and language information into the very fabric of a metric's pretraining process.\n\nThink of it as giving these metrics a crash course in dialect appreciation!  Our experiments demonstrate that NANO not only enhances dialect robustness but also improves overall performance on standard benchmarks, all without ballooning the model size.\n\nThis work is a call to action for the NLG community.  By embracing dialect awareness and robustness, we can pave the way for evaluation tools that truly reflect the richness and diversity of human language. \n\n\n", "You know how sometimes you use a map to figure out the best way to get somewhere?

It takes a mathematical expression, like \"x^2 + 2x\", and figures out its derivative, which is \"2x + 2\".  But how do you actually describe what this program is doing in a precise and formal way?\n\nWell, you need to talk about two things:  the *syntax* of the expression (what it looks like, the symbols and their arrangement) and the *semantics* (what it actually means mathematically). \n\nA \"syntax framework\" is like a blueprint for describing how a program manipulates these expressions.  It tells you how to break down an expression into its basic parts, how to talk about those parts using a special language, and how to go back and forth between the expression itself and its meaning.\n\nThis paper looks at two different ways to build a syntax framework and use it to formally describe a math algorithm. \n\nOne way is to define the syntactic parts within the formal system itself, but keep the \"quotation\" and \"evaluation\" (going from expression to meaning and back) outside, in a separate \"metatheory.\"\n\nThe other way is to represent *every* expression within the system with its syntactic counterpart, and include \"quotation\" and \"evaluation\" as built-in operations. \n\nSo, it's like two different ways to teach a computer to speak the language of math \u2013 one with a separate dictionary and another with the dictionary built right in!

This study presents new infrared observations of this interaction zone, located in the southern region of HB 21, obtained using the Infrared Camera (IRC) onboard the AKARI satellite and the Wide InfraRed Camera (WIRC) at the Palomar 5-meter telescope.\n\nOur observations span a range of near- and mid-infrared wavelengths, encompassing the IRC's N4 (4 \u03bcm), S7 (7 \u03bcm), and S11 (11 \u03bcm) bands, as well as the WIRC's H2 v=1->0 S(1) line emission at 2.12 \u03bcm.  These multi-wavelength images reveal striking diffuse features surrounding a previously identified CO cloud, a clear signpost of the ongoing shock-cloud interaction.\n\nTo unravel the physics behind these emissions, we compare our observations with theoretical models of shocked molecular hydrogen (H2).  We find that the IRC color data is well-described by a thermal admixture model, where the distribution of H2 gas temperatures follows a power-law relation.

While electromagnetic, acoustic, and optical channels have been demonstrated, this paper unveils a novel and insidious attack vector:  vibrational (seismic) covert channels.\n\nWe exploit a ubiquitous yet overlooked phenomenon: the subtle vibrations produced by computer fans.  These inaudible vibrations, correlated with fan speed, propagate through the structures supporting the computer, creating a hidden communication medium.\n\nOur attack leverages malware's ability to manipulate these vibrations by precisely controlling fan speeds.

This study delves into the economic feasibility of a 25 W average load magnetic refrigerator, utilizing commercially available gadolinium (Gd) as the magnetocaloric material.\n\nOur comprehensive numerical model takes into account not only the initial costs of materials (magnetocaloric material and magnets) but also the long-term operating expenses. We find that for a device with a 15-year lifespan, the total cost falls within a reasonable range of $150 to $400, depending on the market prices of Gd and magnets.\n\nInterestingly, the cost breakdown reveals that the magnets contribute the most to the overall expense, closely followed by operating costs.

This investigation aims to rigorously calibrate the Galactic PL relations across various photometric bands (from B to K) and compare them to the well-established PL relations for the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).\n\nOur analysis utilizes a sample of 59 Cepheid variables with precise distances determined through five independent methods: Hubble Space Telescope and revised Hipparcos parallaxes, infrared surface brightness and interferometric Baade-Wesselink techniques, and classical Zero-Age-Main-Sequence fitting for Cepheids associated with open clusters or OB associations. We carefully address the complexities of absorption corrections and the appropriate projection factor for converting radial velocities to pulsational velocities.\n\nOur findings reveal no statistically significant difference in the slopes of the PL relations between the LMC and our own Milky Way galaxy.  This supports the conclusion that Cepheid PL relations exhibit universal slopes across all photometric bands, independent of the host galaxy, at least for the LMC and Milky Way.\n\nWhile a potential zero-point offset related to metallicity is not addressed in this study, our data suggest an upper limit of 18.50 for the LMC distance modulus.

The focus is on the impact of finite rebinding probabilities on the dynamic force spectrum, particularly during bond rupture under linearly increasing load (extension) and bond reformation after complete separation (relaxation).\n\nWe calculate the probability distribution of rupture forces and analyze its dependence on the loading rate. At high loading rates, both the rupture and rejoining forces exhibit a predictable dependence on the loading rate, determined by the shape of the potential energy landscape.  As the loading rate decreases, the mean rupture force in extension and the mean rejoining force in relaxation converge, reflecting the system's approach to equilibrium. \n\nFurthermore, we examine the influence of external parameters, such as cantilever stiffness and the presence of a soft linker, on the rupture force distribution and mean rupture force.

In particular, such non-universality can significantly impact the detectability of neutral MSSM Higgs bosons (h/H/A) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).\n\nThis study investigates the consequences of non-universal gaugino masses for Higgs boson production arising from the supersymmetric cascade decay chain initiated by gluino production in proton-proton collisions.  The specific decay chain under consideration proceeds as follows: gluino \u2192 squark + quark, squark \u2192 neutralino_2 + quark, neutralino_2 \u2192 neutralino_1 + h/H/A, and finally, h/H/A \u2192 b + b-bar.\n\nWe demonstrate that in scenarios with universal gaugino masses and a singlet representation, only the light Higgs boson (h) can be produced in this cascade within the parameter region of interest. However, the introduction of non-universal gaugino masses opens up the possibility for the heavy neutral MSSM Higgs bosons (H/A) to dominate production.\n\nFurthermore, we carefully examine the parameter space allowed by the constraints imposed by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) on the relic density of cold dark matter.  Our analysis reveals that in cases with non-universal gaugino masses, the detection of heavy Higgs bosons in the studied cascade is feasible within parameter regions consistent with the preferred neutralino relic density from WMAP observations. \n\nWe also demonstrate that specific combinations of representations can yield the required dark matter abundance across the entire parameter space.

That's where extreme learning machines (ELMs) come in \u2013 they're like super-fast learners that can make predictions even with messy data.\n\nBut here's the cool part: we've found a way to make ELMs even better using something called \"graph signal processing.\"  Think of it like giving the ELM a map that connects all the data points.\n\nThis map, or \"graph,\" tells the ELM how the data points are related to each other.  We then use a special trick called \"regularization\" to make sure that the ELM's predictions are smooth and consistent with the map.\n\nIt's like telling the ELM, \"Hey, don't just focus on individual data points, look at the bigger picture and make sure your predictions make sense in the context of the map!\"\n\nWe tested this approach on real-world data and it worked like a charm!  When the training data was limited or noisy, our \"graph-savvy\" ELM made significantly better predictions than a regular ELM.  \n\nSo, next time you're trying to predict something with limited or messy data, remember the power of graphs!  They can help your ELM see the forest for the trees and make more accurate predictions. \n\n\n", "Imagine a pot of soup simmering on a stove. The heat from the stove causes the soup to bubble and swirl, creating complex patterns of motion. This is similar to what happens in turbulent plasmas, like the solar wind, where particles are constantly moving and interacting.\n\nIn these plasmas, collisions between particles play a crucial role in heating the system.  Think of it like the collisions between soup molecules transferring heat throughout the pot.  \n\nRecently, scientists discovered that these collisions are even more important than we thought, especially when the plasma has fine-scale structures in velocity space.  Imagine tiny whirlpools within the soup, increasing the rate at which heat is transferred.\n\nThis study digs deeper into this phenomenon, comparing two different ways of describing these collisions: a full, nonlinear model and a simplified, linearized model.  \n\nWe found that using the full, nonlinear model is crucial for accurately capturing the heating process.  While both models reveal the presence of multiple timescales associated with different types of motion, the nonlinear model shows that these motions dissipate much faster.\n\nIt's like realizing that those tiny whirlpools in the soup actually disappear much quicker than we initially thought, leading to faster heating.  \n\nThis research highlights the importance of considering the full complexity of particle collisions when studying turbulent plasmas, especially in astrophysical environments like the solar wind.\n\n\n", "As semiconductor manufacturing pushes towards ever-smaller feature sizes (below 32nm), detecting and classifying microscopic defects becomes increasingly challenging. Traditional rule-based methods employed by optical and e-beam inspection tools often struggle with accurate classification, leading to costly misclassifications and requiring time-consuming human intervention.\n\nThis research presents a significant advancement in automated defect inspection by leveraging the power of Mask R-CNN, a deep learning algorithm renowned for its object detection and instance segmentation capabilities. Building upon our previous work in deep learning-based defect analysis, we extend the approach to achieve precise defect instance segmentation in Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images.\n\nOur method not only identifies and classifies defects but also generates precise masks outlining the extent of each defect instance. This enables:\n\n* **Accurate Quantification:**  We can extract and calibrate each segmented mask, quantifying the number of pixels associated with specific defect categories. \n* **Defect Counting and Area Measurement:**  We can accurately count individual defect instances for each category and calculate their surface area in terms of pixels.\n\nOur focus is on detecting and segmenting a diverse range of challenging stochastic defect patterns, including bridges, breaks, and line collapses. Crucially, our method can differentiate between subtle variations within defect categories, such as distinguishing between thin, single, multi-line, horizontal, and non-horizontal bridge defects. This level of granularity is essential for advanced semiconductor processes involving aggressive pitches and thin resist layers (high numerical aperture applications).\n\nThrough rigorous quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. It delivers superior accuracy compared to traditional methods, paving the way for fully automated, highly accurate defect inspection in advanced semiconductor manufacturing. \n\n\n", "Imagine a vast network of interconnected points, a complex graph where every connection follows strict rules.  This is the realm of distance-regular graphs, mathematical structures with intricate symmetries and hidden patterns. \n\nOur research focuses on a key parameter, \u03bb, which counts the number of common neighbors shared by any two connected points in this graph.  Think of it as a measure of local interconnectedness.\n\nBuilding on the work of Spielman and Pyber, who established bounds for a specific type of graph called strongly regular graphs, we unveil a tighter and more general bound for \u03bb.  This discovery is not merely a mathematical curiosity; it's a key ingredient in recent breakthroughs concerning the complexity of determining whether two strongly regular graphs are essentially the same (isomorphic).\n\nOur proof relies on a remarkable geometric structure within these graphs, unearthed by Metsch under certain conditions.  Imagine a constellation of cliques, tightly knit groups of points where everyone knows everyone else. Metsch showed that, when certain relationships between the graph's parameters hold, these cliques emerge with a predictable size and arrangement.\n\nWe provide a streamlined proof of this geometric insight, demonstrating that when the product of the graph's degree (k) and a parameter related to connections at distance 2 (\u03bc) is much smaller than \u03bb squared (k\u03bc = o(\u03bb^2)), something magical happens.  Each connection in the graph belongs to a unique, maximal clique of size roughly equal to \u03bb, while all other cliques fade into insignificance.\n\nThese special cliques, we reveal, are \"asymptotically Delsarte,\" echoing the properties of a well-known construction in coding theory.  This connection hints at a deep and unexpected link between these seemingly disparate areas of mathematics.\n\nOur work provides a powerful new lens for understanding the structure of distance-regular graphs, illuminating their hidden symmetries and revealing the surprising role of cliques in shaping their properties. \n\n\n", "Astronomers have noticed that galaxies form stars at different rates depending on their surroundings.  To understand this diversity, it's crucial to study how giant molecular clouds, the birthplaces of stars, form and evolve in different galactic environments.\n\nOne puzzling observation is that bars in strongly barred galaxies seem to be missing massive stars, even though there's plenty of gas available for star formation.  It's like having all the ingredients for a cake but finding no oven to bake it!\n\nTo investigate this mystery, we created a computer simulation of a strongly barred galaxy, using the structure of NGC 1300 as a template.  We compared the properties of molecular clouds in three different environments: the bar, the bar-ends, and the spiral arms.\n\nWe found that clouds in all these regions are gravitationally bound \u2013 meaning they're held together by their own gravity \u2013 so that's not the reason for the lack of massive stars in the bar.  Instead, we focused on cloud-cloud collisions, which are thought to be essential for triggering the formation of massive stars. \n\nOur simulation revealed that clouds in the bar collide much faster than in other regions.  It's like a cosmic demolition derby! We discovered that this frantic motion is caused by the bar's gravity, which forces the gas into elongated orbits, leading to more frequent and violent collisions.\n\nThese findings suggest that the lack of star formation in the bars of strongly barred galaxies is caused by these speedy collisions.  When clouds collide too fast, they don't have enough time to collapse and form massive stars. \n\nSo, it seems that the bar's strong gravitational influence, while stirring up the gas, also hinders the birth of massive stars, creating a cosmic paradox of plenty of ingredients but a lack of stellar ovens. \n", "This investigation presents a comprehensive analysis of the mass-metallicity relationship (MMR) for star-forming galaxies within the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey.  The MMR, a fundamental correlation in astrophysics, describes the observed trend of increasing metallicity (heavy element abundance) with increasing galaxy mass.\n\nWe rigorously derive oxygen abundances using robust strong emission line ratio diagnostics. Subsequently, we apply a systematic range of selection criteria based on signal-to-noise ratios of various emission lines, as well as apparent and absolute magnitudes.  This meticulous approach allows us to identify potential sources of discrepancies in the MMR reported in previous studies.\n\nOur analysis demonstrates that the shape and position of the MMR can vary significantly depending on the adopted metallicity calibration and sample selection criteria.  Employing a robust metallicity calibration, we find that the MMR for redshifts 0.061 < z < 0.35 in the GAMA survey is consistent with that derived from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), despite probing a different luminosity range.\n\nThese findings underscore the importance of carefully considering methodological choices when comparing MMRs across different surveys and studies.  Our results caution against direct comparisons without accounting for potential variations arising from sample selection and analysis techniques.  \n\nFurthermore, our analysis suggests a modest level of evolution in the MMR within the GAMA sample over the redshift range 0.06 < z < 0.35. This work provides a robust and detailed characterization of the MMR in the GAMA survey, offering valuable insights for understanding the interplay between galaxy mass, metallicity, and cosmic evolution. \n", "Imagine two fluids, like oil and water, flowing through a sponge. Understanding how these fluids move and interact within the sponge's intricate network of pores is a challenge in fluid dynamics. \n\nOur research presents a new way to describe this complex two-phase flow, based on the fundamental principles of thermodynamics. We've derived a set of equations that relate the speeds of each fluid to the forces driving their motion, like pressure differences.\n\nOur secret ingredient?  A new concept called the \"co-moving velocity,\" which captures how the structure of the sponge itself influences the flow. Think of it like the sponge's own \"personality\" that shapes how the fluids move through it.\n\nWe put our theory to the test, first by solving four different versions of the classic \"capillary tube\" model \u2013 a simplified representation of a porous medium.  Then, we took it a step further, using a computer simulation of a complex network of interconnected tubes to mimic a real-world sponge.\n\nThe results were spot on!  Our equations accurately predicted the flow behavior in both the simple and complex models. This research provides a powerful new tool for understanding multi-phase flow in porous media, with applications in fields like oil recovery, groundwater management, and even designing better filters! \n", "Life's boundless creativity, evident in the staggering diversity of forms and functions across the biosphere, stands as a hallmark distinguishing the living from the nonliving. It is this very essence of open-ended evolution (OEE) that captivates the field of Artificial Life (ALife), inspiring researchers to replicate the dynamic and unpredictable emergence of novelty observed in nature.\n\nThis article serves as an introduction to the second of two special issues dedicated to cutting-edge research in OEE, offering a comprehensive overview of the contributions within both volumes.  The majority of the featured work was initially presented at a dedicated workshop on OEE during the 2018 Conference on Artificial Life in Tokyo, building upon the foundation laid by two previous ALife workshops in Cancun and York.\n\nWe present a streamlined categorization of OEE research, highlighting the key themes and approaches employed in this vibrant field.  Through a concise summary of the articles contained within this special issue, we illuminate the significant progress made towards understanding and replicating the principles of OEE in artificial systems.  This collection of research represents a crucial step towards unraveling the mysteries of life's boundless creativity and harnessing its power for technological innovation.\n", "Imagine a microscopic layer cake, where ultrathin films of magnesium oxide (MgO) are delicately layered atop a silver (Ag) surface.  These atomically thin structures hold immense potential for tailoring material properties and designing next-generation electronic devices.\n\nThis research delves into the fascinating world of these MgO/Ag interfaces, exploring how strategically placing magnesium atoms within the silver layer can dramatically alter the electronic landscape.  We employ a powerful trio of experimental and theoretical techniques \u2013 Auger electron diffraction, ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations \u2013 to unravel the secrets of these modified interfaces.\n\nLike skilled detectives, we use the layer-by-layer resolution of Auger electron spectra to map out the atomic arrangement, revealing a striking distortion of the interface layers caused by the presence of those extra magnesium atoms.  This distortion, a subtle shift in the atomic dance at the interface, has a profound impact on the material's electronic properties, leading to a significant reduction in its work function \u2013 a measure of how easily electrons can escape the surface.\n\nOur DFT calculations, like a virtual microscope peering into the quantum world, confirm and explain these experimental observations.  They not only reproduce the observed lattice distortion but also reveal a fascinating electron transfer from magnesium to silver atoms at the interface.  This redistribution of charge, like a microscopic tug-of-war, is responsible for the observed work function reduction.\n\nOur investigation delves deeper, dissecting the contributions of various factors, including charge transfer, atomic \"rumpling,\" and electrostatic compression, to the overall work function change.  The verdict?  The dominant force behind this electronic transformation is the enhanced electrostatic compression effect, a consequence of the subtle interplay between charged atoms at the interface.\n\nThis research illuminates the power of atomic-scale engineering to manipulate the electronic properties of materials, opening exciting new avenues for designing high-performance electronic devices with tailored functionalities. \n\n\n\n", "Industrial process monitoring is plagued by the persistent problem of incomplete observations.  Critical process parameters often fall below the detection limits of measuring systems, resulting in censored data that obscures the true state of the process.  This issue is particularly acute in scenarios with high levels of censorship, exceeding 70%, rendering traditional monitoring methods unreliable and potentially dangerous.\n\nThe inadequacy of conventional approaches stems from their inability to handle the complexities of censored data.  They fail to provide accurate assessments of the process state, leaving operators blind to potential problems and hindering timely corrective actions.\n\nThis paper attempts to address this deficiency by proposing a new method for estimating process parameters in the presence of censored data.  However, the proposed algorithm and its corresponding control chart offer only a limited solution.  The complexities of high censorship levels and the inherent uncertainties associated with censored data continue to pose significant challenges for effective process monitoring, leaving room for potentially catastrophic failures. \n\n\n", "Clustering, a cornerstone of data analysis, has traditionally focused on distance metrics and grouping algorithms.  This work breaks new ground by introducing Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC), a powerful method that fundamentally reimagines clustering through the lens of deep learning.\n\nDEC harnesses the representation learning capabilities of deep neural networks to simultaneously learn optimal feature representations and cluster assignments.  It achieves this by mapping the input data to a lower-dimensional feature space, where a clustering objective is iteratively optimized.\n\nOur comprehensive experimental evaluations, spanning both image and text datasets, demonstrate DEC's undeniable superiority.  It consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art clustering methods, achieving significant improvements in clustering accuracy and revealing more meaningful data groupings.\n\nThis research establishes DEC as a leading approach for clustering, harnessing the power of deep learning to unlock new insights from complex datasets and revolutionize data-driven applications across diverse domains. \n", "This study builds upon the work of Sarvotham et al. [2005], which investigated the relationship between peak transmission rate and network burstiness.  We analyze TCP packet headers, grouping packets into sessions characterized by a 5-tuple: total payload (S), duration (D), average transmission rate (R), peak transmission rate (Peak R), and initiation time (Initiation T).\n\nOur analysis necessitates a revised definition of peak rate.  Departing from the two-group (alpha and beta) segmentation used by Sarvotham et al., we demonstrate the heterogeneity of the beta group by segmenting sessions into 10 groups based on empirical peak rate quantiles. This finer segmentation reveals nuanced structural characteristics not captured by a simple two-group division.\n\nExamining the dependence structure of (S, D, R) within each segment, we observe variations across groups.  Furthermore, while session initiation times within each segment closely resemble a Poisson process, this property does not hold for the entire dataset. \n\nThese findings highlight the importance of peak rate as a key factor influencing network structure and behavior.  We propose that incorporating peak rate information is essential for constructing accurate simulations of real-world network traffic. A basic methodology for such traffic simulation, based on our observations, is outlined. \n\n\n", "The Brouwer fixed-point theorem, a cornerstone of topology, offers a fascinating lens through which to explore the potential existence of traversable wormholes.  This theorem guarantees that for any continuous function mapping a compact convex set onto itself, there must exist at least one point that remains unchanged by the function.\n\nIn the context of wormhole geometry, we can relate this fixed point to the \"throat\" of a wormhole, a crucial point where spacetime curves dramatically, potentially connecting distant regions of the universe.  \n\nRemarkably, we can leverage the Brouwer fixed-point theorem to demonstrate that, under certain conditions, the existence of this wormhole throat is a direct consequence of the mathematical structure of spacetime.  This suggests that the possibility of traversable wormholes isn't just a wild speculation; it emerges naturally from established mathematical principles without requiring us to venture beyond currently accepted physical laws. \n\nThis connection between abstract mathematics and the physical world offers a tantalizing glimpse into the potential for wormholes to exist, inspiring further investigation into their properties and the conditions necessary for their formation. \n", "Within the intricate labyrinth of the human body, medical images reveal a hidden world of anatomical structures, a delicate dance of tissues and organs.  To decipher this visual symphony, researchers have turned to the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), those digital virtuosos capable of recognizing patterns and extracting meaning from vast amounts of data.\n\nYet, traditional CNNs, with their two-dimensional gaze, struggle to fully grasp the three-dimensional complexity of medical scans. This work unveils a novel approach, a volumetric CNN that embraces the full depth and richness of medical volumes.\n\nTrained on a collection of MRI scans depicting the prostate, our CNN learns to paint a precise segmentation map, outlining the organ's boundaries with a single, graceful stroke. We introduce a new objective function, the Dice coefficient, as our guiding star, ensuring that even in the face of imbalanced data, where foreground and background voxels compete for attention, our network remains steadfast in its pursuit of accuracy.\n\nTo overcome the scarcity of annotated training data, we employ a symphony of random non-linear transformations and histogram matching, creating a kaleidoscope of augmented data that expands the network's visual vocabulary.\n\nOur experimental evaluation reveals the brilliance of this approach.  Our volumetric CNN achieves remarkable accuracy on challenging test data, all while performing its intricate calculations with a fraction of the time required by its predecessors.\n\nThis research marks a pivotal step towards a future where intelligent algorithms, guided by the artistry of deep learning, illuminate the hidden depths of medical imaging, empowering clinicians with tools of unprecedented precision and insight.\n\n\n", "The energy levels of a two-body system interacting through the Coulomb force are described by the famous Balmer series, derived from the non-relativistic Schr\u00f6dinger equation.  However, in 1954, Wick and Cutkosky, using the relativistic Bethe-Salpeter equation, discovered the existence of additional energy levels when the interaction strength (\u03b1) exceeds \u03c0/4. \n\nThe physical nature of these extra states remained a puzzle, leading to doubts about their existence. Our recent work resolves this mystery, demonstrating that these states are primarily governed by the exchange of massless particles traveling at the speed of light. \n\nBecause these massless particles are inherently relativistic, they are not captured by the non-relativistic Schr\u00f6dinger equation, explaining why the extra states were absent in previous calculations. \n", "This research delves into the heart of quantum information theory, exploring the fundamental properties of a powerful new concept: the quantum f-relative entropy. This generalized entropy measure, defined using an operator convex function f(.), unlocks a deeper understanding of quantum information processing tasks, from channel capacity to entanglement manipulation.\n\nWe rigorously establish the equality conditions for two crucial properties: monotonicity and joint convexity. These conditions, essential for a well-behaved entropy measure, are remarkably general, holding for a broader class of operator convex functions than previously known.  Intriguingly, for the specific case of f(t) = -ln(t), our conditions reveal new and unexpected nuances.\n\nBuilding upon this foundation, we define the quantum f-entropy and unveil its key properties, deriving precise equality conditions in several cases. This exploration illuminates the rich mathematical structure of this generalized entropy framework.\n\nWe then extend our analysis to crucial information-theoretic quantities, demonstrating that the f-generalizations of Holevo information, entanglement-assisted capacity, and coherent information all obey the data processing inequality. This fundamental inequality ensures that information cannot be increased by processing alone, a cornerstone of both classical and quantum information theory.  \n\nFurthermore, we derive the equality conditions for the f-coherent information, providing a deeper understanding of the limits of information transmission through quantum channels.  This work lays the foundation for a powerful new framework for understanding quantum information, paving the way for advances in quantum communication, cryptography, and computation.  \n\n\n", "A fundamental principle in computer vision is that simple transformations like translations or rotations of an image should not alter the outcome of tasks such as object recognition.  While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) naturally exhibit translation equivariance (shifting the input image shifts the feature maps accordingly), achieving rotation equivariance is more challenging.\n\nCurrent approaches rely on data augmentation to achieve global rotation equivariance, but attaining equivariance to local, patch-wise rotations remains elusive.  This work introduces Harmonic Networks (H-Nets), a novel CNN architecture that exhibits equivariance to both patch-wise translations and 360-degree rotations.\n\nWe achieve this by replacing standard CNN filters with circular harmonics, which provide a maximal response and orientation for every receptive field patch, regardless of its rotation. H-Nets utilize a rich, yet parameter-efficient and computationally frugal representation. Analysis reveals that deep feature maps within the network encode complex rotational invariants, capturing the essence of the input image regardless of its orientation.\n\nOur H-Net layers are versatile and can be seamlessly integrated into existing architectures, complementing techniques like deep supervision and batch normalization.  We demonstrate state-of-the-art classification accuracy on rotated-MNIST and achieve competitive results on other benchmark challenges.  These findings highlight the potential of H-Nets to advance rotation-invariant computer vision applications. \n", "This study investigates the reflection spectra of directly coupled waveguide-cavity systems, utilizing Fano resonance analysis to elucidate the underlying reflection and coupling mechanisms. Unlike side-coupled systems, where Fano resonances typically arise from interference at waveguide termini, our investigation reveals a distinct origin for the observed Fano line shapes: the coupling between the measurement apparatus (optical fiber) and the waveguide.\n\nWe conduct meticulous experimental measurements of the reflection spectra, complemented by a rigorous analytical model.  Our analysis demonstrates a strong dependence of the Fano parameter, which quantifies the asymmetry of the resonance line shape, on the precise coupling conditions between the fiber and the waveguide.  \n\nSpecifically, we observe that even minute displacements of the fiber tip, well within the Rayleigh range, induce dramatic alterations in the Fano line shape.  This heightened sensitivity highlights the crucial role of the measurement apparatus in shaping the observed resonant behavior within directly coupled waveguide-cavity systems.  \n\nOur findings provide a deeper understanding of the interplay between coupling, interference, and Fano resonances in integrated optical systems, with implications for the design and characterization of photonic devices. \n\n\n", "Atmospheric turbulence, the shimmering of air that makes stars twinkle, is a major headache for astronomers using ground-based telescopes.  It blurs images and limits the sharpness of observations, even with advanced adaptive optics systems. \n\nBut measuring the strength and distribution of this turbulence throughout the atmosphere is a tricky task.  This paper introduces a clever new technique for tackling this challenge using a simple setup: a small telescope and a series of short-exposure images of a star field.\n\nOur method analyzes the tiny, jittery movements of stars in these images, comparing them in pairs to calculate something called \"structure functions.\" These functions describe how the turbulence distorts light waves coming from different directions in the sky.\n\nWe then match these observed structure functions to theoretical predictions from simple turbulence models using a powerful statistical technique called Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo optimization.  This allows us to estimate key parameters like:\n\n* **Turbulence profile:** How the strength of turbulence varies with altitude in the lower atmosphere.\n* **Total seeing:** The overall blurring caused by turbulence.\n* **Free-atmosphere seeing:** The blurring caused by turbulence above the telescope's location.\n* **Outer scale:**  The largest size scale of turbulent eddies.\n\nWe've tested our method thoroughly using computer simulations and demonstrated its effectiveness on real data from the AST3 telescope in Antarctica.  This new technique provides astronomers with a valuable tool for characterizing atmospheric turbulence, helping them optimize telescope performance and capture sharper images of the cosmos. \n", "This work introduces a novel mathematical framework for understanding n-plectic structures, a generalization of symplectic geometry that plays a crucial role in theoretical physics and differential geometry.  We define an n-plectic structure as a specific type of algebraic object called a \"commutative and torsionless Lie Rinehart pair,\" endowed with a distinguished cocycle from its Chevalley-Eilenberg complex.\n\nThis \"n-plectic cocycle\" acts as a key ingredient, giving rise to an extension of the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex, a powerful tool for studying Lie algebras and their representations. This extended complex, populated by \"symplectic tensors,\" provides a natural framework for generalizing the concepts of Hamiltonian functions and vector fields, which are central to symplectic geometry.\n\nOur construction elevates these familiar notions to a richer world of tensors and cotensors, encompassing a range of degrees.  These generalized Hamiltonian objects form a remarkable algebraic structure known as a Lie \u221e-algebra, capturing the intricate relationships and symmetries within the n-plectic setting.\n\nFinally, we demonstrate that \"momentum maps,\" crucial for connecting symmetries to conserved quantities in physics, emerge naturally within our framework.  We identify them as \"weak Lie \u221e-morphisms,\" mappings that preserve the algebraic structure, from an arbitrary Lie \u221e-algebra into the Lie \u221e-algebra of Hamiltonian tensors and cotensors.\n\nThis research provides a powerful new lens for exploring the geometry and algebra of n-plectic structures, paving the way for deeper insights into their role in theoretical physics, particularly in areas like classical and quantum field theory, as well as in the study of geometric mechanics and quantization. \n\n\n", "This study reveals the underlying mechanism behind the stretched-exponential relaxation observed in various macroscopic properties of amorphous solids (glasses), particularly near the glass transition temperature. \n\nHere are the key findings:\n\n* **Stretched-exponential relaxation:** This behavior is prevalent in several properties of glasses, such as the intermediate scattering function, dielectric relaxation modulus, and time-elastic modulus.\n* **Connection to lattice dynamics:** We demonstrate, using dielectric relaxation as an example, that this peculiar relaxation pattern is intimately linked to the unique vibrational characteristics of glasses.\n* **Reformulated Lorentz model:** We generalize the classical Lorentz model for dielectric materials, expressing the dielectric response in terms of the vibrational density of states (DOS).\n* **Glass transition and stretched-exponential behavior:** Our analysis reveals that near the glass transition (coinciding with the Maxwell rigidity transition), the dielectric relaxation precisely exhibits stretched-exponential behavior with Kohlrausch exponents (\u03b2) ranging from 0.56 to 0.65. This range aligns remarkably well with experimental observations across various glassy systems.\n* **Origin in soft modes:** We identify the root cause of this stretched-exponential relaxation as the presence of \"soft modes\" (boson peak) in the vibrational density of states.\n\nThis work establishes a clear connection between the microscopic vibrational properties of glasses and their macroscopic relaxation behavior, providing a fundamental understanding of stretched-exponential relaxation in amorphous materials. \n\n\n", "This paper addresses the challenging problem of achieving unsupervised representation disentanglement in the text domain. Despite its success in computer vision, disentanglement remains largely unexplored for text.  \n\nTo illuminate the challenges and opportunities, we carefully select a representative set of disentanglement models that have proven effective for images. We rigorously evaluate these models using six established disentanglement metrics, as well as downstream classification tasks and homotopy analysis.\n\nTo facilitate this evaluation, we introduce two novel synthetic text datasets with known generative factors, providing a controlled environment for assessing disentanglement performance. Our experiments reveal a significant gap between current capabilities and desired outcomes for text disentanglement.  \n\nFurthermore, our findings highlight the potential impact of factors like representation sparsity and the coupling between representation and decoder on disentanglement performance.  These insights provide valuable guidance for future research in this domain.\n\nThis work represents the first systematic exploration of unsupervised representation disentanglement for text.  By establishing a comprehensive evaluation framework and providing specifically designed datasets, we aim to catalyze future advancements in this crucial area of natural language processing. \n", "This paper presents a novel hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for solving the unit commitment (UC) problem, a fundamental optimization task in power systems. We decompose the UC problem into three distinct subproblems: a quadratic program, a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, and an unconstrained quadratic program.\n\nLeveraging the strengths of both classical and quantum computing, we employ a classical optimization solver for the first and third subproblems, while the QUBO subproblem is tackled using the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA).  Coordination between these subproblems is achieved through an iterative three-block alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm.\n\nWe validate the efficacy of our proposed algorithm through simulations conducted using Qiskit on the IBM Q quantum computing platform. Our results demonstrate the feasibility and potential of this hybrid approach for solving the UC problem, showcasing the synergistic interplay between classical and quantum computation in addressing complex optimization challenges in the energy domain. \n", "Scientists have long suspected that Delta Scuti stars, a type of pulsating star, harbor a rich tapestry of hidden oscillations, too faint to be detected from Earth.  The CoRoT space mission, with its unparalleled sensitivity, offered a unique opportunity to unveil these subtle stellar tremors.\n\nThis study focused on HD 50844, a Delta Scuti star observed by CoRoT with exquisite precision.  Analyzing over 140,000 data points, the researchers achieved an unprecedented noise level, allowing them to detect incredibly faint oscillations.\n\nThe results were astonishing.  Hundreds of pulsation frequencies were identified, confirming the long-held belief that Delta Scuti stars possess a remarkably rich spectrum of oscillations.  Further analysis using spectroscopic data revealed that these oscillations correspond to modes with very high degrees, reaching up to l=14, indicating complex patterns of stellar vibrations.\n\nGround-based observations suggest that HD 50844 is an evolved star nearing the end of its main sequence lifetime, with a slightly lower abundance of heavy elements. This evolutionary stage might explain the lack of a clear, regular pattern in the observed frequencies.\n\nBy combining data from both space-based and ground-based telescopes, the researchers confidently identified the most prominent oscillation frequency (f1 = 6.92 d^-1) as the star's fundamental radial mode, the basic \"heartbeat\" of its pulsations.\n\nThis research highlights the power of space-based observations to uncover subtle astrophysical phenomena, revealing the hidden complexities of stellar pulsations and advancing our understanding of stellar evolution. \n", "This study investigates star formation within the S231-S235 region, nestled inside the giant molecular cloud G174+2.5. Utilizing archival carbon monoxide (CO) data, we identified all massive molecular clumps within G174+2.5 and characterized their mass, size, and CO column density.\n\nSubsequent observations targeted these clumps, focusing on \"quasi-thermal\" emission lines of ammonia (NH3) and cyanoacetylene (HC3N), as well as maser lines of methanol (CH3OH) and water vapor (H2O).  Our observations yielded the first detections of NH3 and HC3N lines towards two specific clumps, WB89 673 and WB89 668, providing compelling evidence for the presence of dense gas within these regions.\n\nUsing the ammonia emission data, we estimated the physical properties of the molecular gas in these clumps.  Our analysis indicates gas temperatures ranging from 16 to 30 Kelvin and hydrogen number densities between 2.8 and 7.2 x 10^3 cm^-3.\n\nFurthermore, we report a new detection of the 36.2 GHz methanol maser line towards WB89 673, a spectral signature often associated with shocks within molecular clouds.

Our uGMRT observations, spanning 250-1450 MHz and 4-937 days post-burst, represent the first detection of a GRB afterglow in the 250-500 MHz range and the second brightest GRB observed by the uGMRT. \n\nDespite extensive temporal coverage, our analysis reveals no evidence of a transition to the non-relativistic phase or a jet break in either the radio or X-ray light curves.  We model the synchrotron afterglow emission using two scenarios:  a relativistic, isotropic, self-similar deceleration model and a shock-breakout cocoon model.  \n\nThe density profile inferred from our data deviates from a standard constant density medium, suggesting that GRB 171205A exploded within a stratified, wind-like environment. Notably, the low-frequency radio data, encompassing the absorbed portion of the light curves, proves crucial for determining the circumburst medium's properties.\n\nCombining our data with previously published measurements, we conclude that the radio afterglow consists of two components: a weak, potentially slightly off-axis jet and a surrounding cocoon. Our analysis supports the findings of Izzo et al. (2019), suggesting that cocoon emission dominates at early times, while the jet contribution becomes dominant at later epochs, resulting in flatter radio light curves.  These findings underscore the importance of low-frequency radio observations for probing GRB environments and afterglow evolution. \n", "This paper utilizes the novel theory of quasi-Lie schemes to analyze Emden-type equations, a class of nonlinear ordinary differential equations with applications in astrophysics and other fields.  We present a systematic approach for deriving time-dependent constants of motion for these equations, leveraging particular solutions and specific conditions on the equation parameters.  Our method recovers previously known results while offering a fresh perspective and extending the analysis to a broader class of Emden-type equations. \n\n\n", "This investigation explores the phenomenology of charged Higgs bosons within the framework of a model characterized by the gauge symmetry SU(3)_c \u2297 SU(3)_L \u2297 U(1)_X, commonly referred to as the 3-3-1 model.  We demonstrate that by incorporating Yukawa mixing couplings spanning both small (GeV) and large (TeV) energy scales, the model predicts the simultaneous production of two distinct types of charged Higgs bosons: the hypercharge-one (H_1^{\\pm}) and hypercharge-two (H_2^{\\pm}) bosons.\n\nAt low energies, the H_1^{\\pm} bosons exhibit phenomenological characteristics consistent with those predicted by two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDMs).  The H_2^{\\pm} bosons, however, represent additional charged Higgs states unique to the 3-3-1 model.  Therefore, the observation of multiple charged Higgs boson resonances at collider experiments could provide a discriminating test for these models.\n\nWe perform a detailed analysis of H_{1,2}^{\\pm} pair production and associated tbH_{1,2}^{\\pm} production at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC).  Notably, we find that the pair production cross-section, mediated by the exchange of a heavy neutral Z' gauge boson predicted by the 3-3-1 model, can be comparable in magnitude to the single production cross-section in gluon-gluon collisions.\n\nConsidering leptonic decay channels (H_{1,2}^{\\pm} \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd_\u03c4), we identify scenarios where distinct peaks corresponding to H_2^{\\pm} events emerge in the transverse mass distributions, discernable above the H_1^{\\pm} background. These findings underscore the potential of the LHC to probe the rich phenomenology of extended Higgs sectors and differentiate between various theoretical models. \n\n\n\n\n", "This study investigates isospin breaking effects in the $K_{\\ell 4}$ form factors, specifically those induced by the mass difference between charged and neutral pions.  The analysis employs a framework based on suitably subtracted dispersion representations. \n\nWe construct the $K_{\\ell 4}$ form factors iteratively up to two loops in the low-energy expansion, incorporating constraints from analyticity, crossing symmetry, and unitarity arising from two-meson intermediate states. Analytical expressions for the phases of the two-loop form factors in the $K^\\pm\\to\\pi^+\\pi^- e^\\pm \\nu_e$ channel are derived.  These expressions enable a direct connection between experimentally measured phase shift differences in the form factors (outside the isospin limit) and theoretically calculated phase shift differences in the $S$- and $P$-wave $\\pi\\pi$ scattering amplitudes (within the isospin limit).\n\nOur analysis provides a general framework for studying the dependence on the $S$-wave scattering lengths, $a_0^0$ and $a_0^2$, in the isospin limit, surpassing previous limitations of one-loop chiral perturbation theory analyses. \n\nWe reanalyze experimental data from the NA48/2 collaboration at CERN, incorporating isospin-breaking corrections to extract values for the scattering lengths $a_0^0$ and $a_0^2$.  This comprehensive study provides a refined understanding of isospin breaking effects in $K_{\\ell 4}$ decays and their implications for low-energy pion-pion scattering parameters. \n", "This paper presents a compelling statistical description of the cosmological constant within a de Sitter universe, demonstrating its emergence from massless excitations incorporating Planckian effects. We build upon previous work, specifically extending the results presented in references [1, 2, 3, 4].\n\nWe unequivocally establish that at the classical level, a positive cosmological constant (\u039b > 0) can only be obtained in the limit of zero temperature (T \u2192 0). Analogous to the case of black holes, incorporating quantum effects allows for a representation of \u039b in terms of massless excitations, provided quantum corrections to the Misner-Sharp mass are considered.\n\nCrucially, our analysis reveals that quantum fluctuations give rise to an effective cosmological constant that varies with the physical scale under consideration. This provides a compelling resolution to the cosmological constant problem without invoking a quintessence field. \n\nFurthermore, the remarkably small observed value of \u039b can be attributed to the existence of a quantum decoherence scale exceeding the Planck length. This scale dictates a transition to a pure de Sitter universe characterized by a small, averaged cosmological constant frozen in its lowest energy state.  These findings provide a robust and elegant explanation for the origin and magnitude of the cosmological constant within a quantum gravitational framework. \n", "This study examines the one-dimensional spin-glass model with vector spins in the limit of infinite spin components (m \u2192 \u221e) and power-law decaying interactions (\u03c3). We investigate both the fully connected and diluted versions of the model, observing significant differences between them.\n\nAt zero temperature, we determine the defect energy exponent (\u03b8) by analyzing the ground-state energy differences between systems with periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions. Our results suggest a relationship \u03b8 = 3/4 - \u03c3, implying an upper critical value of \u03c3 = 3/4, corresponding to the lower critical dimension of the short-range model.\n\nFor finite temperatures, we solve the large-m saddle-point equations self-consistently, extracting the correlation function, order parameter, and spin-glass susceptibility.  We carefully analyze finite-size scaling effects, highlighting distinct behaviors below and above the lower critical value of \u03c3 = 5/8, which corresponds to the upper critical dimension (8) of the hypercubic short-range model. \n", "The enigmatic Of^+ supergiants, a rare class of stars, exhibit properties that bridge the gap between typical O-type stars and the enigmatic Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars.  Recent studies have illuminated striking similarities between these transitional objects and WN-type WR stars, particularly in the visible and near-infrared spectral domains, suggesting commonalities in their stellar wind characteristics.\n\nIn this presentation, we report on the first dedicated X-ray observations of two Of^+ supergiants, HD 16691 (O4If^+) and HD 14947 (O5f^+). Our analysis reveals soft thermal X-ray spectra consistent with expectations for single O-type stars.  However, the measured X-ray luminosities are notably lower than anticipated for isolated O-type stars.\n\nThis intriguing under-luminosity suggests that the unique properties of their stellar winds, a hallmark of their transitional nature, significantly influence their X-ray emission. We propose that the observed X-ray deficiency in HD 16691 and HD 14947 serves as an X-ray signature of their intermediary evolutionary stage between O and WR stars, likely attributable to enhanced wind densities.  \n\n\n\n", "The AARTFAAC project is an ambitious endeavor to create an All-Sky Monitor (ASM) using the powerful Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) radio telescope. The goal is to continuously scan the vast expanse of the sky visible to LOFAR, searching for fleeting bursts of radio waves known as transients. \n\nThis real-time monitoring system will be capable of detecting transients on timescales ranging from milliseconds to days, enabling rapid follow-up observations with the full power of LOFAR whenever a potential transient candidate is discovered.\n\nCreating such a system presents formidable challenges:\n\n* **Imaging a Vast Field of View:** The ASM must capture images of the entire sky visible to LOFAR, requiring a vast amount of data processing.\n* **Low Latency Processing:** To enable rapid response to transient events, data processing must occur with minimal delay.\n* **Continuous Availability and Autonomous Operation:**  The ASM must operate continuously and autonomously, without requiring constant human intervention.\n\nTo address these challenges, the AARTFAAC project has developed a cutting-edge correlator, the heart of the signal processing system.  This correlator, the largest of its kind in the world, can handle an enormous number of input channels, enabling it to process the vast amounts of data necessary for all-sky imaging. When fully operational, it will generate an astounding 150,000 correlations per second for each spectral channel.\n\nTo refine the design and quantify the instrument's capabilities, the team conducted test observations using existing LOFAR infrastructure.  This paper provides a detailed overview of the AARTFAAC data processing pipeline, showcasing the complexity of handling such massive data streams.\n\nWe present stunning all-sky images generated from one of these test observations, illustrating the system's ability to capture the dynamic radio sky.  These results offer quantitative estimates of the instrument's sensitivity and resolution, highlighting the immense potential of AARTFAAC to revolutionize our understanding of transient phenomena in the universe. \n\n\n", "You know those massive stars, the ones that live fast and die young? Well, Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are like the rock stars of the stellar world \u2013 they're the evolved versions of those super-bright O-type stars and they're thought to be the culprits behind those awesome Type Ib/c supernova explosions.\n\nWe've been using the Hubble Space Telescope to check out WR stars in the galaxy M101, and we've found something really interesting. Turns out, those narrow-band filters are like a secret weapon for spotting these elusive stars.  We're finding way more WR stars with these filters compared to the usual broad-band methods.\n\nOn average, we're catching an extra 42% of WR stars with narrow-band imaging, and that number jumps to a whopping 85% in the crowded center of the galaxy!  This means that just because we don't see a WR star in a broad-band image of a supernova doesn't mean it wasn't there all along. \n\nSo, those Type Ib/c supernovae that seemed to have no WR star parent?  Well, they might have had a sneaky WR star hiding in plain sight!  This changes the game for understanding how these massive stars explode and leave behind those incredible supernova remnants. \n\n\n"]
