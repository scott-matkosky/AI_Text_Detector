["Process calculi based on logic, like $\\pi$DILL and CP, establish a framework for creating concurrent programs that avoid deadlocks. However, a discrepancy exists between the proof construction rules and term constructors in the $\\pi$-calculus, where the key operator for parallel composition does not align with any linear logic rule. In their 2019 work, Kokke et al. introduced Hypersequent Classical Processes (HCP) to resolve this mismatch by employing hypersequents (sets of sequents) to denote parallelism in typing judgments. Transitioning from CP to HCP marks a significant development. HCP currently lacks reduction semantics, and incorporating delayed actions disrupts the expected behavior of CP processes when interpreted as HCP processes. To address these issues, we present HCP-, a modified version of HCP that includes reduction semantics but excludes delayed actions. We demonstrate progress, preservation, and termination results and confirm that HCP- accommodates the same communication protocols as CP.", "A BDDC preconditioner variant with constraints on selected subobjects is introduced, ensuring a bounded preconditioner condition number of $C \\big(1+\\log (L/h)\\big)^2$. As $L$ is flexible, the condition number can be as small as $O(1). We will explore the benefits, drawbacks, and applications for heterogeneous problems, supported by numerical results on supercomputers.", "Examples are provided where the Heun function exists as solutions of wave equations encountered in general relativity. The Dirac equation, when formulated with the Nutku helicoid metric background in four-dimensional spacetime, gives rise to Mathieu functions as its solutions. The extension to five dimensions yields the double confluent Heun function. By applying specific transformations, we simplify this solution to the Mathieu function. The imposition of Atiyah-Patodi-Singer spectral boundary conditions is necessary for this system due to the singularity present at the origin in the metric.", "Numerous authors have demonstrated that the gradual decrease in X-rays seen during the decay stage of long-duration flares (LDE) can be attributed solely to ongoing magnetic reconnection and energy release in the coronal region of a flare. Utilizing RHESSI data, we aim to address two key inquiries: How impactful are these mechanisms during the decay phase of LDEs, and how can we accurately calculate the energy release rate based on this information? By reconstructing images of selected LDEs during their decay phase and conducting spectral analysis, we obtained the physical characteristics of flare coronal sources, enabling us to assess the efficiency of the energy release process. Additionally, we analyzed the components of the energy equation to determine the precision of each term's determination.", "We employ a multi-scale analysis to characterize the distinctive geometrical arrangement of clusters under the FK measure in random media. Our findings are valid in dimensions equal to or greater than 2, assuming slab percolation takes place under the averaged measure, a condition likely to exist throughout the supercritical phase. This study builds upon Pisztora's work and presents a crucial analytical tool for investigating the supercritical regime in disordered FK models as well as in disordered Ising and Potts models.", "Classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) exhibit weak photospheric absorption lines compared to normal stars, a phenomenon known as veiling. This veiling is typically attributed to excess continuous emission originating in shock-heated gas at the stellar surface beneath the accretion streams. Our study focuses on four stars (RW Aur A, RU Lup, S CrA NW, and S CrA SE) with unusually strong veiling to conduct a thorough investigation of veiling in relation to stellar brightness and emission line strengths for comparison with standard accretion models. Through photometric and spectroscopic monitoring at various time points, we aim to explore how a variable accretion rate in standard models translates to fluctuating excess emission and corresponding changes in stellar brightness.\n\nOur findings reveal that the veiling of absorption lines in these stars exhibits significant variability, often requiring the release of multiple stellar luminosities of potential energy due to large veiling factors. Interestingly, during periods of pronounced line dilution, the derived veiling factors do not show a strong correlation with brightness. Furthermore, the emission line strengths defy the anticipated relationship between veiling and line strength. Notably, the veiling can undergo substantial changes within a single night and does not align with the rotational phases in two stars.\n\nWe demonstrate that in at least three of the stars, high veiling results in the filling-in of photospheric lines by line emission, generating substantial veiling factors independent of changes in continuous emission from shocked regions. We also consider the potential impact of dust extinction and electron scattering in the accretion stream on veiling measurements in CTTS. Ultimately, we assert that the degree of veiling cannot serve as a reliable indicator of accretion rates in CTTS with complex emission line spectra.", "Giant low surface brightness (GLSB) galaxies have been traditionally viewed as large, dark matter-dominated entities. However, this perspective has been formed mainly on the basis of rotation curves that are subject to significant uncertainties. In this study, we focus on two iconic GLSB galaxies, Malin 1 and NGC 7589, by re-examining existing HI observations and generating new rotation curves. These newly obtained rotation curves shed light on the distribution of luminous and dark matter within these galaxies.\n\nContrary to earlier investigations, the rotation curves of both Malin 1 and NGC 7589 exhibit a sharp incline in their central regions, reminiscent of high surface brightness (HSB) systems. Mass decompositions incorporating a dark matter halo reveal that baryonic matter may play a predominant role in governing the dynamics of the inner regions. Notably, a \"maximum disk\" fitting approach yields stellar mass-to-light ratios within the customary range observed in HSB galaxies. \n\nThese findings, combined with the outcomes of recent research efforts, propose that GLSB galaxies possess a dual nature: comprising an inner HSB early-type spiral galaxy and an outer, extensive LSB disk. Furthermore, our evaluation of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) indicates that the rotation curve of NGC 7589 aligns well with the model's predictions, whereas Malin 1 poses a formidable challenge to the theory's capabilities.", "The study investigates the multiplicity distribution, multiplicity moment, scaled variance, entropy, and reduced entropy of target evaporated fragments emitted in forward and backward hemispheres in interactions with emulsion heavy targets (AgBr) induced by various ions at different energies (12 A GeV $^{4}$He, 3.7 A GeV $^{16}$O, 60 A GeV $^{16}$O, 1.7 A GeV $^{84}$Kr, and 10.7 A GeV $^{197}$Au). Results show that the multiplicity distribution of the emitted fragments can be accurately described by a Gaussian distribution. The multiplicity moments increase with the order of the moment {\\em q}, with the second-order moment being independent of energy for all interactions. The scaled variance, indicating multiplicity fluctuations, is close to one, suggesting a weak correlation among the produced particles. Furthermore, the entropy of the emitted fragments is consistent between forward and backward hemispheres within experimental uncertainties.", "We thoroughly examine the time-dependent behavior of a quantum dot when subjected to off-resonant optical excitation for rapid acoustic phonon-assisted state manipulation. Our analysis reveals three distinct processes occurring during the state preparation driven by short laser pulses: initial state dressing upon pulse initiation, subsequent relaxation induced by phonons, and final state undressing at the pulse's conclusion. Through investigation of various excitation scenarios with different pulse shapes, we emphasize the crucial role of an adiabatic undressing in determining the ultimate state in short pulse protocols. Additionally, we illustrate how specific laser characteristics, such as pulse detuning and length, along with the biexciton binding energy, can be utilized to target a desired quantum dot state within exciton-biexciton systems.", "In the realm of quantum mechanics, the probabilistic interpretation was introduced as a subsequent addition to the Hilbert space formalism, largely compelled by empirical observations rather than inherent to the mathematical framework itself. An alternate model that inherently incorporates a clear probabilistic interpretation from its inception is found within quantum logics boasting unique conditional probabilities. This model involves projection lattices in von Neumann algebras, where the process of probability conditionalization aligns with the state transition observed in the Lueders - von Neumann measurement process. This alignment prompted the establishment of a hierarchy encompassing five levels of compatibility and measurability within the abstract context of quantum logics featuring unique conditional probabilities. These levels signify various concepts such as the absence of quantum interference or influence, the presence of joint distributions, the capacity for simultaneous measurability, and the state independence following two successive measurements irrespective of their order. A supplementary level denotes when two elements of the quantum logic are part of the same Boolean subalgebra. While these five levels may diverge in the general scenario, they ultimately converge within the common Hilbert space formalism of quantum mechanics, in von Neumann algebras, and under certain other conditions.", "This analysis studies how wave-vector dispersion is affected in layered magneto-optic media with elliptical birefringence and one-dimensional periodicity. The differences in local normal-mode polarization between layers cause mode coupling, affecting the wave-vector dispersion and Bloch states of the system. This coupling introduces additional terms in the dispersion relation not seen in uniform circularly birefringent media. It can remove degeneracies at specific frequencies and create a magnetization-dependent band gap. The research investigates the conditions for band gap formation, showing that a frequency split can be linked to a coupling parameter based on the polarization states of nearby layers. The study also explores the Bloch states and ways to enhance band splitting in these systems.", "This study extends classical empirical risk minimization to random subspaces of a given space. This approach explores computational savings while maintaining learning accuracy, even for non-smooth loss functions like the hinge loss in support vector machines. Theoretical results demonstrate that computational efficiency can be improved without sacrificing performance, supported by simple numerical experiments.", "Patient consent is crucial for accessing medical data. In traditional healthcare systems, consent is obtained through a form signed by the patient. In e-Health systems, paper forms are being replaced by incorporating consent into the data access controls, giving patients the ability to manage consent more effectively. However, the process of granting and revoking consent varies based on the patient's situation. We argue that capturing such detailed processes as authorization policies is challenging and error-prone. This paper introduces ACTORS, a goal-driven approach that uses Teleo-Reactive (TR) programming to manage consent by considering changes in the patient's domains and contexts when providing consent.", "This paper discusses the math analysis of the inverse random source problem for a specific type of diffusion equation. The source is assumed to be influenced by a certain type of random movement. The main goal is to understand how the source impacts the diffusion equation. The paper looks at both a direct problem, which studies the diffusion equation with this source, and an inverse problem, which aims to find out information about the source based on the data from the diffusion equation. The analysis uses specific math functions and concepts related to the random movement involved.", "Manifold learning methods are essential for reducing the dimensionality of high-dimensional data sets with low intrinsic dimensionality. Many of these methods are graph-based, where each data point is associated with a vertex and each pair with a weighted edge. Current theory indicates that the Laplacian matrix of the graph approaches the Laplace-Beltrami operator of the data manifold when the pairwise affinities are based on the Euclidean norm. This paper focuses on determining the differential operator limit for graph Laplacians constructed using $\\textit{any}$ norm. Our proof involves the interplay between the second fundamental form of the manifold and the convex geometry of the unit ball corresponding to the given norm. To showcase the advantages of non-Euclidean norms in manifold learning, we examine the task of mapping large molecules with continuous variability. In a numerical simulation, we demonstrate that a modified Laplacian eigenmaps algorithm using the Earthmover's distance outperforms the classic Euclidean Laplacian eigenmaps in terms of computational efficiency and the required sample size for recovering the intrinsic geometry.", "We present an efficient method using integral equations to address the heat equation $u_t (\\mathbf{x}) - \\Delta u(\\mathbf{x}) = F(\\mathbf{x},t)$ within a two-dimensional, multiply connected domain under Dirichlet boundary conditions. Rather than employing integral equations relying on the heat kernel, a time discretization approach is initially utilized. This results in a non-homogeneous modified Helmholtz equation being solved at each time increment. The solution to this equation is expressed as a combination of a volume potential and a double layer potential. The volume potential is computed with the aid of a fast multipole-accelerated solver. The imposition of boundary conditions is achieved by solving an integral equation related to the homogeneous modified Helmholtz equation. Utilizing the fast multipole method (FMM), the integral equation solver is also enhanced for efficiency. With a total of $N$ points in the discretization of both the boundary and the domain, the overall computational complexity per time step is on the order of $O(N)$ or $O(N\\log N)$.", "We explore an innovative scheme involving sequential state-discrimination measurements on qudits to determine the initial quantum state prepared. These qudits, belonging to a nonorthogonal set of quantum states, pose a challenge in being reliably distinguished. Through unambiguous state discrimination, we achieve error-free measurements at the cost of occasional inconclusive outcomes. Qudits offer the potential to convey higher information density per transmission compared to qubits. We analyze the case where Alice dispatches one of N qudits, each with a dimensionality of N. By examining scenarios with uniform state overlaps and mixed state overlaps across distinct qudit sets, we deepen our insights. Additionally, we investigate the resilience of our scheme against basic eavesdropping attempts and observe that leveraging qudits enhances error detection probabilities compared to qubits.", "The aim of this work is to enhance access control in Hyperledger Fabric blockchain by integrating various ID's, attributes, and policies with the current access control components. The existing access control system of Hyperledger Fabric is thoroughly examined before proposing a new implementation that builds upon the current system. This proposed solution offers users and developers easier methods to make access control decisions based on multiple ID's, attributes, and policies. The new implementation includes encapsulating the Fabric CA client to simplify attribute addition and streamline the process of registering and enrolling a new certificate for a newly created user. The research demonstrates the feasibility of combining multiple ID's, attributes, and policies using Hyperledger Fabric's smart contract technology. Additionally, it shows that the performance impact on real-world applications is minimal when compared to always granting access without proper access control measures in place.", "Introducing PyConv: A Revolutionary Approach to Computer Vision Tasks\n\nUnveiling the groundbreaking PyConv, a revolutionary technique that processes input across multiple filter scales, enhancing recognition abilities and computational efficiency without increasing costs.

Check out our code at: https://github.com/iduta/pyconv", "The presentation will cover progress in the search for solar axions using the CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST). The results of the initial stage of CAST phase II, which involved filling the magnet bores with 4He gas at varying pressures to explore axion masses up to 0.4 eV, will be detailed. By observing the absence of excess X-rays when the magnet was directed towards the Sun, we established an upper limit on the axion-photon coupling of g < 2.17 x 10^10 GeV$-1 at a 95% confidence level for axion masses below 0.4 eV, with the precise value determined by the pressure conditions. The ongoing investigation in the latter part of CAST phase II is focused on detecting axions with masses up to approximately 1.2 eV using 3He as a buffer gas. Anticipated sensitivities will be discussed, along with upcoming prospects and potential long-term strategies for a new helioscope experiment.", "Observations reveal that the Arctic sea ice cover is receding quickly, while the Antarctic sea ice cover is steadily growing. State-of-the-art climate models generally predict a modest decrease in both the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice covers. Nevertheless, a few model simulations in each hemisphere mirror the observed sea ice trends. Recent studies suggest that the models align with the observations in each hemisphere once internal climate variability is considered. Examining sea ice changes from 1979 to 2013 in simulations from the CMIP5 and CESM-LE projects, we build on previous research highlighting a strong connection between global-mean surface temperature and sea ice extent in climate models. Our analysis finds that models projecting Arctic sea ice retreat at the observed rate during 1979-2013 exhibit significantly higher levels of global warming than recorded. When estimating the sea ice retreat under observed global warming levels in each simulation, less than 1% of the time did the models project Arctic sea ice retreat matching actual observations. These findings suggest a lack of consistency between models and observations. In the Antarctic region, the simulations typically predict sea ice expansion resembling observed trends with insufficient global warming, although these results are less definitive. This study indicates that the models fail to capture the observed difference in sea ice trends between the Arctic and Antarctic, suggesting that the models might produce accurate sea ice trends in both regions for inaccurate reasons.", "Biometric features are increasingly important for authenticating IoT devices. This investigation aims to identify factors that hinder the development and widespread deployment of biometric models. These factors include human physiological (e.g., face, eyes, fingerprints, palm, or electrocardiogram) and behavioral features (e.g., signature, voice, gait, or keystroke). The research covers various machine learning and data mining methods used in authentication and authorization for mobile IoT devices. It also examines threat models and countermeasures employed in biometrics-based authentication for these devices. Specifically, the study evaluates current biometric authentication schemes for IoT devices and highlights challenges for future research in this area.", "Sure! Here is a restated version of the text with a different tone:\n\nThe topic of device fingerprinting on the web has garnered considerable interest, both within the research community and the commercial sector. While existing fingerprinting methods rely on software running on the device, these can be readily altered by the user, rendering the device fingerprint ineffective. However, in this position paper, we highlight the potential of the HTML5 standard to introduce a new set of fingerprinting features that are hardware-based. These features offer increased durability against manipulation, thus providing a more reliable device fingerprint. We introduce various plausible methods for fingerprinting devices using HTML5 web applications and share initial findings from an experiment focusing on GPU fingerprinting.", "Here's a more casual version of the passage you provided:\n\nWe're talking about the partition function of Chern-Simons theory with an exceptional gauge group on a three-sphere. This is like looking at the refined closed topological string, where we use a special formula that connects a single K\\\"ahler parameter, the string coupling constant, and a refinement parameter. The different values of the refinement parameter for the groups $G_2, F_4, E_6, E_7, E_8$ are $\\frac{5}{3}, \\frac{5}{2}, 3, 4, 6$, respectively.\n\nSome specific non-zero BPS invariants are mentioned, like $N^2_{0,\\frac{1}{2}}=1$ and $N^{11}_{0,1}=1$. And then there are other terms in the partition function that come from the refined constant maps in string theory.\n\nThe derivation is based on a universal form of the Chern-Simons partition function on a three-sphere, but it's focused on a special line called $Exc$. This line has certain parameters that relate to exceptional groups. There's also another line called $F$ which includes groups like $SU(4), SO(10),$ and $E_6$, and it follows a similar pattern of results.\n\nIn both cases, the refinement parameter $b$ (related to Nekrasov's parameters) is expressed in terms of universal parameters on the line, given by $b=-\\beta/\\alpha$.", "The centerpoint theorem is a renowned and commonly utilized result in discrete geometry. It asserts that, for a point set $P$ consisting of $n$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, there exists a point $c$ (which may not belong to $P) such that each halfspace containing $c$ includes at least $\\frac{n}{d+1}$ points from $P. This specific point $c$ is known as a centerpoint, serving as an extension of a median to dimensions beyond one. Essentially, a centerpoint serves as a representative for the point set $P. However, considering the possibility of multiple representatives, especially in one-dimensional datasets where certain quantiles are often preferred over the median, we explore an adaptation of quantiles to higher dimensions. This extension involves identifying a set $Q$ of a few points where each halfspace containing a point from $Q$ encompasses a substantial portion of points from $P, and any halfspace containing more points from $Q$ includes an even larger fraction of points from $P. This concept bears similarities to established notions like weak $\\varepsilon$-nets and weak $\\varepsilon$-approximations, positioned as an intermediary between the former and the latter in terms of strength.", "We have developed a new software tool called \\textsc{PsrPopPy} to simulate populations of pulsars. This software is an enhancement of the existing \\textsc{Psrpop} package, now rewritten in Python to leverage the language's object-oriented capabilities and enhance code modularity. While it includes pre-written scripts for standard simulations, users can easily create custom scripts due to its flexible design.\n\nThe improved modular structure allows for straightforward integration of experimental features, such as new models for period or luminosity distributions, compared to previous versions. We also explore additional modeling capabilities of the software. In our demonstration, we analyze pulsar spectral indices across different observing frequencies and establish that they follow a normal distribution with a mean of $-1.4$ and a standard deviation of $1.0. Additionally, we use the software to study pulsar spin evolution and determine the best-fit relationship between a pulsar's luminosity and spin parameters.\n\nOur analysis, inspired by previous studies, reveals that the radio luminosity ($L$) of pulsars follows a power-law dependence on period ($P$) and period derivative ($\\dot{P}$), with an optimal fit given by $L \\propto P^{-1.39 \\pm 0.09} \\dot{P}^{0.48 \\pm 0.04}$\u2014a pattern akin to that observed in $\\gamma$-ray pulsars. By applying this relationship, we create a model population to investigate the age-luminosity trend in the entire pulsar population, particularly in anticipation of data from future surveys like the Square Kilometer Array.", "We examine how a group of spinning particles interacts strongly with a single-mode resonator that is stimulated by external pulses. When the average frequency of the spinning particles aligns with the resonant frequency of the cavity, we observe damped Rabi oscillations occurring between the group of spinning particles and the cavity. We provide a detailed description of this interaction, taking into account the dephasing impact of the varied spinning frequencies. Our research demonstrates that having accurate information about this frequency variation is essential for both understanding and predicting the time-dependent behavior of the spinning particles and the cavity. By utilizing special resonance conditions when applying pulses, we illustrate that the coherent oscillations between the spinning particles and the cavity can be significantly amplified. We verify the effectiveness of our theoretical model through an experiment involving a collection of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond interacting with a superconducting coplanar single-mode waveguide resonator.", "We are examining the properties of a quantum Ising spin-1/2 chain in a transverse field, focusing on the fundamental Riemannian metric of its ground state and the cyclic quantum distance. By utilizing a specific transformation technique, we can simplify the model and express it in terms of a fermionic Hamiltonian. The Riemannian metric of the ground state is obtained precisely on a circular parameter space, created by adjusting the spin Hamiltonian through a twist operator transformation. We investigate the behavior of the cyclic quantum distance and the second derivative of the ground-state energy across various regions of inhomogeneous exchange coupling parameters. Notably, we discover that the quantum ferromagnetic phase in a uniform Ising chain can be distinguished by a consistent cyclic quantum distance with an unchanging ground-state Riemannian metric, which diminishes rapidly to zero in the paramagnetic phase.", "Rotation measure synthesis estimates Faraday dispersion using a Fourier transform as the primary method to study cosmic magnetic fields. This mathematical approach is analogous to one-dimensional interferometric intensity measurements but in a different Fourier space. By applying concepts from two-dimensional intensity interferometry, we can analyze Faraday dispersion, including modeling the impact of channel averaging during reconstruction. Simulation demonstrates successful recovery of signals with large rotation measure values previously undetectable, crucial for low-frequency and wide-band polarimetry. Additionally, integrating mosaicking in Faraday depth with channel averaging enables wide-band rotation measure synthesis across data from multiple telescopes. This advancement is vital for enhancing the quality and quantity of polarimetric science, particularly in extreme environments like those around pulsars and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), enabling these sources to serve as precise probes of cosmological fields.", "The study investigates the unique properties of charged particle production in high-energy hadron-nucleus collisions by applying different statistical models. Predictions from the Negative Binomial, shifted Gompertz, Weibull, and Krasznovszky-Wagner distributions are compared to evaluate the success of each model. These distributions, based on various functional forms, stem from either empirical parameterizations or underlying dynamic models. Some of these models have been applied to analyze data from the LHC in proton-proton and nucleus-nucleus collisions. The analysis incorporates a range of physical and derived observables.", "In 1975, John Tukey introduced a revolutionary concept of the multivariate median, identifying the most central point within a data cloud in multiple dimensions. Building on Tukey's idea, David Donoho and Miriam Gasko later explored the notion of data depth by considering hyperplanes through arbitrary points and determining their depth based on separation from the surrounding data points. These pioneering concepts have not only borne fruit but have also given rise to a rich statistical methodology centered around data depth and nonparametric depth statistics. Various notions of data depth have been developed, each with unique properties, making them suitable for diverse applications. \n\nBy exploring the upper level sets of a depth statistic, researchers have uncovered depth-trimmed regions that offer valuable insights into a distribution's location, scale, and shape, akin to identifying a median. The concept of data depth has transcended empirical data clouds, extending its reach to general probability distributions in multi-dimensional spaces, enabling the establishment of laws of large numbers and consistency results. Moreover, this concept has also been applied to data in functional spaces, further expanding its utility and applications.", "Strain-engineering in SiGe nanostructures is essential for developing optoelectronic devices at the nanoscale. In this study, a novel approach is explored where SiGe structures are laterally confined by the Si substrate to achieve high tensile strain without the need for external stressors, thus enhancing scalability. Spectro-microscopy techniques, finite element method simulations, and ab initio calculations were employed to analyze the strain state of laterally confined Ge-rich SiGe nano-stripes. The strain details were determined using tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, achieving an unprecedented lateral resolution of approximately 30 nm. The nano-stripes displayed a significant tensile hydrostatic strain component, with maximum strain at the center of the top free surface that decreases towards the edges. The lattice deformation exceeded the typical values for thermally relaxed Ge/Si(001) layers, with this strain enhancement attributed to frustrated relaxation in the out-of-plane direction resulting from lateral confinement by the substrate side walls and plastic relaxation of the misfit strain at the SiGe/Si interface. The impact of this tensile lattice deformation on the stripe surface was investigated through work function mapping using X-ray photoelectron emission microscopy, revealing a positive work function shift compared to a bulk SiGe alloy. This shift was quantitatively supported by electronic structure calculations of tensile strained configurations. These findings could significantly influence the design of nanoscale optoelectronic devices.", "Rephrased text: Sharing electronic medical records or models during an infectious disease pandemic across regions is crucial. Utilizing one region's data/model in another region may encounter distribution shift problems that challenge traditional machine learning methods' assumptions. Transfer learning can address this issue. In order to investigate the effectiveness of deep transfer learning algorithms, we tested two data-based algorithms (domain adversarial neural networks and maximum classifier discrepancy) and model-based transfer learning algorithms for infectious disease detection tasks. We also examined synthetic scenarios with known data distribution differences between regions. Our experiments revealed that transfer learning could prove beneficial in infectious disease classification scenarios when (1) the source and target are similar and the target training data is limited and (2) the target data lacks labels. Model-based transfer learning performed well in the first scenario, with performance comparable to data-based transfer learning models. However, further research is required to study domain shift in real-world research data and address potential performance declines.", "Research in optics and photonics has been highly focused on bound states in the continuum (BIC) in recent years. Exploring the effects of quasi-BICs in basic structures, such as dielectric cylinders, is particularly intriguing due to their pronounced nature. Numerous studies have investigated quasi-BICs in single cylinders and cylinder-based structures. This study examines the characteristics of quasi-BICs as a homogeneous dielectric cylinder in an air environment transitions into a ring with narrow walls by gradually increasing the diameter of the inner air cylinder. The findings illustrate the transition of quasi-BICs from the strong-coupling to the weak-coupling regime, marked by the shift from branches' avoided crossing to their intersection, with the quasi-BIC now being preserved on only one branch. In the strong-coupling and quasi-BIC regime, three waves interact in the far-field zone: two waves corresponding to resonant modes and one wave scattered by the structure. The study also delves into the concept of Fano resonance, particularly in the context of only two-wave interference under weak coupling conditions.", "The combination of temperature stratified turbulence and inertia of small particles results in turbulent thermal diffusion, leading to a non-diffusive turbulent flux of particles aligned with the turbulent heat flux direction. This flux is dependent on the mean particle number density and the effective velocity of inertial particles. While the theory was previously limited to small temperature gradients and Stokes numbers, a more generalized theory has now been developed for arbitrary conditions. Laboratory experiments in various turbulent flows have confirmed the theory, showing that the effective velocity of inertial particles relative to the vertical turbulent velocity decreases with increasing Reynolds numbers. Additionally, the effective velocity and coefficient of turbulent thermal diffusion increase with Stokes numbers, peaking at small values and declining for larger ones, while the coefficient decreases with the mean temperature gradient. Overall, the developed theory aligns well with experimental findings.", "One common model used to explain the visibility of pulsar radio emission assumes that the emission is focused within a narrow cone along the tangent to a dipolar magnetic field line. While the widely accepted rotating vector model (RVM) provides a practical approximation by keeping the observer's line of sight fixed, it deviates from the tangent model, which takes into account the changing visible point as the pulsar rotates (Gangadhara 2004). In the tangent model, the visible point moves along a trajectory on a sphere of radius r as a function of the pulsar's rotational phase \u03c8. Recent research has suggested the potential observability of this motion using interstellar holography (Pen et al. 2014).\n\nBy comparing the RVM with the tangent model, we find that the RVM tends to underestimate the range of \u03c8 over which emission is detectable, particularly for pulsars emitting across a broad \u03c8 range. The geometry strongly indicates that pulsar radio emission likely occurs at heights exceeding ten percent of the light-cylinder distance, where the neglect of retardation effects could introduce significant errors.", "This paper introduces a novel method for zero-shot learning called Global Semantic Consistency Network (GSC-Net), which leverages semantic information from both seen and unseen classes to support effective classification in cases where training samples do not cover all target classes. By using a soft label embedding loss and a parametric novelty detection mechanism, the framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot learning and generalized zero-shot learning tasks across three visual attribute datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and advantages.", "Category theory challenges our traditional notions of mathematical structuralism by emphasizing covariant transformations over invariant forms. Contrary to popular belief, the foundations of mathematics through category theory demand a new philosophy of mathematics. In this paper, I present a compelling non-structuralist interpretation of categorical mathematics and reveal its profound implications for the history of mathematics and mathematics education.", "In a dynamic system of an exciton-polariton condensate with incoherent pumping, we demonstrate that utilizing a ring-shaped pump enables the creation of stable vortex memory elements with topological charges of $m = 1$ or $m = -1$. By employing basic potential guides, we have the flexibility to either replicate the existing charge or transfer it to a different ring pump location. This control over binary information introduces a novel approach to processing, leveraging vortices as securely protected memory units.", "During the three-year assessment phase of the LOFT mission, a candidate for the M3 launch opportunity of the ESA Cosmic Vision program, we conducted studies to estimate and measure the radiation damage of the silicon drift detectors (SDDs) used in the satellite's instrumentation. Specifically, we exposed the detectors to proton radiation (with energies of 0.8 and 11 MeV) to observe how the increased leakage current and changes in charge collection efficiency were affected by displacement damage. Additionally, we tested the detectors by subjecting them to high-speed dust grains to analyze the impact of debris collisions. In this paper, we will share our findings from these experiments and explore their implications for the LOFT mission.", "In this study, we investigate how low-level multimodal features can be leveraged to determine similarities between movies, within the realm of content-based movie recommendations. We showcase the development of multimodal representation models for movies, utilizing textual data from subtitles, as well as information from the audio and visual components. Specifically, we highlight our exploration of topic modeling in movies based on subtitles to identify distinguishing topics. In the visual domain, we concentrate on extracting meaningful features that capture camera movements, colors, and facial expressions. For the audio domain, we employ basic classification aggregates using pretrained models. By combining these three modalities with static metadata (e.g., directors, actors), we demonstrate that enriching content-based movie similarity with low-level multimodal data can significantly enhance recommendation systems. To validate our proposed content representation approach, we curated a dataset comprising 160 well-known movies. Our findings reveal that incorporating low-level information from text, audio, and visual sources substantially improves the performance of content-based recommendation systems, achieving over a 50% increase in accuracy compared to metadata-centric approaches. This methodology marks a pioneering endeavor incorporating a broad spectrum of features across multiple modalities to amplify content similarity estimation effectiveness over traditional metadata-centric frameworks.", "In this research, we investigate the emission of radiation from a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole possessing an electric charge within the context of quantum gravity. Employing a canonical quantization approach for a symmetric spherical geometry and making reasonable physical assumptions, we successfully address the Wheeler-De Witt equation in various regions encompassing the outer apparent horizon to spatial infinity as well as from the spacetime singularity to the inner apparent horizon. Our analysis reveals that the rate of mass loss from a evaporating black hole due to thermal radiation aligns with semiclassical predictions when certain integration constants are selected based on physical considerations. Additionally, our investigation extends to the zone between the inner Cauchy horizon and the outer apparent horizon, where we demonstrate that the mass loss rate follows a similar pattern for an evaporating black hole.

These objects are sorted into three classes: early types, spirals, and point sources/artifacts, as identified by Galaxy Zoo. By training an artificial neural network on a subset of objects classified by humans, we investigate the network's ability to replicate human classifications on the remaining sample. Our analysis reveals that the success of the neural network in classifying objects accurately relies heavily on the selection of input parameters for the machine-learning algorithm.\n\nWe find that the inclusion of color and profile-fitting parameters aids in distinguishing between the three classes. However, incorporating adaptive shape parameters, concentration, and texture into the analysis significantly enhances the classification results. Notably, parameters such as adaptive moments, concentration, and texture alone prove insufficient for differentiating early type galaxies from point sources/artifacts. By utilizing a comprehensive set of twelve parameters, the neural network achieves classification accuracies exceeding 90% across all morphological classes.\n\nFurthermore, our study demonstrates that incomplete data in terms of magnitude does not negatively impact the classification results, given the specific choice of input parameters for the neural network. Our findings suggest the promising potential of machine learning algorithms for morphological classification in upcoming wide-field imaging surveys. The Galaxy Zoo catalog emerges as a valuable resource for training such algorithms effectively.", "The Lambek calculus, a renowned logical formalism for capturing natural language syntax, has been enhanced to address intricate linguistic nuances beyond the context-free realm. In a groundbreaking extension by Morrill and Valentin (2015), new exponential and bracket modalities were introduced, triggering a fascinating interplay between a non-standard contraction rule for the exponential and the bracket structure. While the standard contraction rule is inapplicable in this framework, our research unveils the undecidability of derivability in their calculus. Furthermore, we delve into the decidable fragments proposed by Morrill and Valentin, demonstrating their classification within the NP class.", "The shift from regarding the transition in 4D Euclidean Dynamical Triangulation between phases as second order was overturned in 1996 when first order behavior was observed in large systems. However, concerns arise about the impact of the numerical methods utilized. Both studies added an artificial harmonic potential to manage volume fluctuations, with one study also introducing an error by taking measurements after a set number of accepted moves instead of attempted moves. Critical slowing down, possibly overlooked, posed a challenge in the simulations. In this study, we address these shortcomings by enabling volume fluctuations within a specific range, monitoring measurements after a set number of attempted moves, and mitigating critical slowing down through an enhanced parallel tempering algorithm. Applying these refined techniques on systems up to 64k 4-simplices confirms the first-order phase transition. Moreover, we introduce a local criterion to determine the state of parts of a triangulation and establish a new relationship between EDT and the balls in boxes model. This correspondence leads to a modified partition function incorporating an additional, third coupling.

The temperature profile is not solely contingent upon the black string itself, but also intricately intertwined with factors such as the quantum property of the emitted fermion and the repercussion of the additional spatial dimension. The introduction of quantum corrections plays a pivotal role in tempering the rate of temperature escalation, thereby paving the way for the emergence of remnants in the evaporation process.", "We present a novel approach to deriving alternative vector representations of words, which are based on topological characteristics from nearby neighbors within pre-trained contextual word embeddings. We then investigate the impact of integrating these alternative vector representations as input features in different deep learning models for natural language processing tasks, such as entity recognition, textual entailment, and paraphrase identification. Interestingly, we observe that simply utilizing information from neighboring words is often sufficient to capture most of the advantages gained from using pre-existing word embeddings. Additionally, the alternative vector representations demonstrate an improved ability to manage diverse data types compared to traditional representations, albeit with some loss of specificity. Moreover, enhancing contextual embeddings with these alternative vector representations can yield further enhancements in model performance in specific scenarios. Furthermore, taking into consideration the variability in initializations of word embeddings, incorporating information from neighboring words in multiple samples of traditional embeddings can lead to enhanced performance in subsequent tasks. Lastly, we uncover intriguing properties of these alternative vector spaces that warrant further investigation, such as higher density and varying semantic interpretations of cosine similarity.", "RIS-aided millimeter wave wireless systems not only excel in overcoming blockages and extending coverage, but they also possess the unique capability of enhancing localization accuracy through communication techniques. This study explores the potential of RIS in providing precise positioning information by leveraging sparse reconstruction algorithms to achieve detailed channel estimation, which is then translated into spatial data. However, the challenge lies in the complexity of sparse recovery due to the vast number of RIS elements and communication arrays. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel multidimensional orthogonal matching pursuit method for compressive channel estimation in RIS-assisted millimeter wave setups. By computing projections on various independent dictionaries rather than a single extensive one, this approach delivers highly accurate channel estimation with reduced complexity. Furthermore, when combined with a localization strategy independent of the exact time of arrival of the Line of Sight (LoS) path, the system showcases remarkable improvements in localization precision. Realistic 3D indoor scenario results demonstrate that RIS-empowered wireless systems can achieve substantial enhancements in localization accuracy.", "Detection and measurement of information leaks via timing side channels play a crucial role in ensuring confidentiality. While static analysis is commonly used to detect these side channels, it is computationally demanding for real-world applications and typically provides only binary results. In some cases, applications may require intentional disclosure of information, necessitating quantification techniques to assess the associated security risks. Given the limitations of static analysis in handling these challenges, we introduce a novel dynamic analysis approach. This method involves two main tasks: first, building a neural network timing model of the program, and second, using this model to quantify information leaks. Our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of both tasks in practice, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach compared to existing side channel detection and quantification methods. Our key technical contributions include a specialized neural network architecture for side channel discovery and an MILP-based algorithm for estimating side channel strength. Through evaluations on micro-benchmarks and real-world applications, we show that neural networks can accurately capture the timing behavior of programs with numerous methods, allowing for efficient detection and quantification of timing side channel leaks.", "The region within the asteroid belt situated between 2.1 and 2.5 astronomical units is of particular significance due to its dynamics, serving as the primary source of chondritic meteorites and near-Earth asteroids. Bounded by an eccentricity-type secular resonance and the 1:3 mean motion resonance with Jupiter, escape from this inner belt necessitates transport to these resonances unless asteroid perihelia allow for scattering by Mars. Yarkovsky forces prove generally ineffective in altering the eccentricity and/or inclination of asteroids with a diameter exceeding approximately 30 kilometers, meaning larger asteroids with pericenters distant from Mars can only depart from the inner belt through substantial changes in eccentricities. This study investigates the chaotic diffusion of orbits near the 1:2 mean motion resonance with Mars in a systematic manner. The research reveals that while chaotic orbital evolution, both in resonant and non-resonant orbits, amplifies the dispersion of inclinations and eccentricities, it has minimal impact on their average values. Moreover, the study illustrates that although dispersive growth is most prominent in resonant orbits, at high eccentricities, the resonance serves to reduce asteroid scattering by Mars, thereby prolonging an asteroid's lifetime within the belt compared to that of a non-resonant orbit. Analysis indicates that irrespective of size, asteroids in resonant and non-resonant orbits necessitate changes in eccentricity beyond the influence of gravitational forces to align with observational data. The study further delves into the protective role of resonant trapping in shielding asteroids from encounters with Mars.", "Nonstandard neutrino interactions (NSI) are like hidden keys that can significantly impact the precision of next-generation neutrino oscillation experiments, adding an intriguing twist to unravel the mysteries of the universe.

Our research shows that this new model performs better than the traditional single-source models. We have also shared our dataset for multi-source morphological reinflection to support future studies.", "There is a growing demand for extracting complex knowledge from semantically annotated data streams quickly, especially in the realms of the Web and the Internet of Things (IoT).

The type of metal compound used in the TMDC layer is essential in determining the strength and characteristics of the resulting SOC effect on the graphene layer. In this study, we observe how the SOC effect changes as we intentionally introduce defects to the TMDC layer. We use computer simulations based on density functional theory to examine layered structures created from a mix of graphene, tungsten, molybdenum, and selenium with different compositions and defect patterns. By comparing our results to different theoretical models, we are able to understand the impact of mixing metals on a local and overall scale. Our research indicates that, even though individual defects can have a significant impact on certain properties, the collective behavior of electrons and spins can be predicted by a simple model based on the mix of metals in the TMDC layer. Additionally, we show that the unique electronic state of these mixed systems can be controlled by adjusting the amount of each metal in the TMDC layer.", "Atomic masses are a vital component in numerous nuclear astrophysics calculations!

Thanks to the examination of SDSS databases, it appears that AGN with a mass (M_BH) \\lesssim 10^5 M_sun are notably missing. This study delves into the mystery of whether these lower mass black holes truly do not exist or if they are simply overlooked due to inefficient BEL production. By leveraging the ionizing spectral energy distribution across a vast black hole mass spectrum, from 10 - 10^9 M_sun encompassing XRBs to AGN, we have computed the equivalent widths (EWs) of key ultraviolet and optical lines such as Ly\\alpha 1216 \\AA, H\\beta 4861 \\AA, CIV 1549 \\AA, and MgII 2798 \\AA. Using the LOC (locally optimally emitting cloud) model to define the broad emission line region (BELR), our findings reveal that while the hardness of the spectral energy distribution doesn't impact BEL EWs with diminishing mass, the size of the BELR - indicated by line widths and controlled by the black hole's mass - dictates the emission line production. Interestingly, there appears to be an EW peak for typical AGN black holes around ~ 10^8 M_sun, below which these lines noticeably dim, with a sharp decline below ~ 10^6 M_sun. This observation could potentially explain why low mass AGN are absent in SDSS data.", "The accuracy of synchronization algorithms, which are established on the pulse-coupled oscillator theory, has been assessed in FPGA-based radios for the inaugural time. The measurements indicate that these algorithms are capable of achieving precision within the low microsecond range when integrated into the physical layer. Additionally, we introduce an algorithm extension that considers hardware phase rate discrepancies, demonstrating that a refined precision of less than one microsecond is attainable with this extension under the current configuration. Consequently, this enhanced algorithm can be employed in ad hoc wireless systems for comprehensive synchronization of transmission slots or sleep cycles in scenarios where centralized synchronization is unattainable.", "The paper examines dataset complexity in Human Trajectory Prediction (HTP) by defining indicators around three concepts: Trajectory predictability, Trajectory regularity, and Context complexity.

The behavior of dissipative reaction networks featuring numerous distinct time scales can be elucidated as a series of consecutive equilibrations involving different subsets of system variables. Polynomial systems exhibiting separation equilibrium occur when at least two monomials, displaying opposite signs and comparable magnitudes, exert significant influence over other terms. These equilibrations and the consequent truncated dynamics, achieved by removing dominated elements, lend themselves to a coherent representation within the framework of tropical analysis, facilitating model simplification.", "We conducted spectral analysis on Suzaku data of the galactic disk and outflow areas in the starburst galaxy M82. In the central disk regions, a minimum of three temperature components is necessary for thermal modeling. The Ly$\\beta$ line fluxes of O VIII and Ne X are higher than anticipated from a plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium. The ratios of Ly$\\beta$/Ly$\\alpha$ lines for O VIII and Ne X also surpass those expected from collisional ionization equilibrium, likely due to charge exchange. In the outflow wind region, two-temperature thermal models accurately replicate the spectra, from which we determined the metal abundances of O, Ne, Mg, and Fe. By comparing to the solar values established by Lodders (2003), the ratios of O/Fe, Ne/Fe, and Mg/Fe are approximately 2, 3, and 2, respectively. As there is no sign of charge exchange in the outflow region, the metal abundance values should be more dependable than those in the central region. This particular abundance distribution suggests that starburst activity leads to enrichment of the outflow through SN II metal expulsion into the intergalactic space.", "Dust particles are traditionally believed to originate in the gusts of immense asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Nevertheless, the current evidence increasingly suggests that dust formation also occurs within supernovae (SNe). To ascertain which of these stellar sources is more significant in producing dust, it is crucial to determine the proportion of freshly created dust in SN debris that can withstand the impact of the counter shock and be dispersed into the interstellar medium. Our recently developed code (GRASH\\_Rev) meticulously traces the progression of nascent dust from the moment of a supernova explosion until the fusion of the advancing shockwave with the circumstellar interstellar medium. Our investigation focuses on four well-documented supernovae within the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud: SN1987A, CasA, the Crab Nebula, and N49. Across all the simulated scenarios, we observe a close agreement with actual observations and predict that approximately 1 to 8$\\%$ of the initial dust mass will endure, equating to a SN dust generation rate of $(3.9 \\pm 3.7) \\times 10^{-4}$ M$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ in the Milky Way. This figure surpasses the dust production rate by AGB stars by an order of magnitude; however, it falls short of counteracting the destruction of dust by supernovae, necessitating further investigation into dust accretion in the gaseous phase.", "This study examines various hatching process strategies for additive manufacturing using an electron beam through numerical simulations. It introduces the physical model and the three-dimensional thermal free-surface lattice Boltzmann method used in the simulation software. The software's validity has been demonstrated through experiments up to 1.2 kW beam power, where a cuboid was hatched using a basic process strategy resulting in outcomes categorized as 'porous,' 'good,' and 'uneven' based on density and surface smoothness. The paper investigates the limitations of this basic strategy at higher beam powers and scan velocities to harness the full potential of high-power electron beam guns up to 10 kW. It then proposes modified process strategies that overcome these constraints to achieve rapid part production while ensuring full density and smooth top surfaces. These strategies aim to reduce build time and costs, optimize beam power utilization, and unlock the capabilities of high-power electron beam guns.", "Bayesian optimization (BO) belongs to a class of global optimization algorithms designed to minimize an expensive objective function with minimal function evaluations. While BO budgets are typically specified in iterations, this method of convergence measurement assumes uniform evaluation costs, which may not be the case across different regions of the search space. For instance, the cost of neural network training rises quadratically with layer size, a common hyperparameter. To address this issue, Cost-aware BO utilizes alternative cost metrics like time, energy, or money for assessing convergence, which vanilla BO methods cannot accommodate. Introducing Cost Apportioned BO (CArBO), our method aims to minimize the objective function at minimum cost. CArBO employs a cost-effective initial design and a cost-cooled optimization phase that adjusts a learned cost model as iterations progress. Through experiments on 20 black-box function optimization problems, we demonstrate that CArBO outperforms competing methods in finding superior hyperparameter configurations under the same cost constraints.", "This project introduces a unique marsupial robotic system made up of both a legged and an aerial robot.

Adjusting the relative velocity to about $v/c \\approx 0.002$ results in a large spin-flip cross section of approximately $2 \\cdot 10^{13}$ barn, as indicated by new QED calculations. We present two options for achieving a positron source with sufficient flux density. One option involves a polarized positron beam with a polarization of 0.70 and a flux density of around $1.5 \\cdot 10^{10}$/(mm$^2$ s) using a radioactive $^{11}$C dc-source. Another option is the production of polarized positrons through pair production with circularly polarized photons, yielding a polarization of 0.76 and requiring injection into a small storage ring. These polarizer sources can be utilized in both low (100 MeV) and high (1 GeV) energy storage rings, allowing for a one-hour time period to build up the polarization of approximately $10^{10}$ antiprotons to about 0.18. A comparison with other proposals indicates a tenfold increase in the figure-of-merit.", "Loops play a crucial role as structural elements in DNA and RNA molecules, especially near the melting point. By considering the logarithmic entropy effect on loop length, a theory for nucleic acid structures is used to investigate single-stranded nucleic acid chains with the same base. In the case of long strands, a phase transition occurs between a compact structure at low temperature/force and a more open structure at high temperature/force. The impact of loop properties on phase transitions, critical behaviors, melting, and force-extension curves is analyzed. For specific loop properties (2 < c < 2.479), a melting transition can occur when no external force is applied, otherwise, the chain remains folded or unfolded depending on the loop exponent value. Singular behavior in force-induced melting transitions can take place for loop exponents below 2.479 and can be observed in experiments using single molecule force techniques. These results have implications for the behavior of double-stranded nucleic acids during hybridization or denaturation. The presence of intra-strand base pairs in denatured regions, especially with a loop exponent around 2.1, leads to pronounced secondary structures within the single strands, affecting the duplex's melting temperature and the denaturation process.", "We investigate the Zeeman spin-splitting in hole quantum wires aligned along the $[011]$ and $[01\\bar{1}]$ crystallographic axes of a high mobility undoped (100)-oriented AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructure. Our results demonstrate that the spin-splitting can be toggled between an 'on' state (nonzero $g^{*}$) and an 'off' state (zero $g^{*}$) by changing the field orientation from parallel to perpendicular relative to the wire. Interestingly, the wire properties remain unchanged for both orientations with respect to the crystallographic axes. Furthermore, we observe a reduction in the $g$-factor in the parallel orientation as the wire width decreases, which differs from electron quantum wires where the $g$-factor is amplified by exchange effects as the wire narrows. These findings support the existence of a $k$-dependent Zeeman splitting resulting from the spin-3/2 properties of holes.", "Drawing upon the rich landscape of real Clifford algebras and even-dimensional vector spaces, we embark on a fascinating journey where space and time intertwine, guided by the mystical modulo 8.

The interaction between theory and numerical simulations has raised awareness regarding the role of magnetic fields in angular momentum transfer. However, a significant challenge remains in incorporating insights from simulations to enhance practical models for comparison with observations. There is a crucial need to accurately incorporate non-local transport mechanisms. Highlighting the absence of large-scale transport in the current theoretical framework, we discuss why the Shakura-Sunyaev approach is essentially a mean field theory and does not account for large-scale transport. Observations of coronae, jets, and findings from magnetorotational instability (MRI) simulations indicate the importance of non-local transport in disc dynamics. The dominance of large-scale contributions in Maxwell stresses at saturation and the inadequacy of viscosity alone to describe MRI transport further emphasize the need for a more comprehensive understanding. While computational limitations have led to a focus on local simulations, the future emphasis should shift towards global simulations to refine mean field theories. A unified approach that merges mean field accretion theory and mean field dynamo theory is proposed to predict the evolution of spectra and luminosity from various disc components effectively. Finally, it is essential to recognize the inherent finite predictive precision of mean field theories when comparing them to observational data.", "This study delves into the global well-posedness of two Diffuse Interface systems that represent the movement of an incompressible two-phase fluid mixture in the presence of capillarity effects within a bounded smooth domain $\\Omega\\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$, where $d=2,3$.

Additionally, we determine the Higgs rapidity distribution with the same precision, taking into account top and bottom quark contributions including interference effects. Our findings are expressed using single and double integrals, explicitly calculated up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). By leveraging our results, we enhance the known NNLO inclusive cross-section calculated within the effective theory integrating fermions in the loop. The impact of finite fermion masses on the inclusive cross-section is minor, with effects reaching only a few percent for large pseudoscalar masses.", "Exploring outlying elements in probability distributions can pose a challenging task. Drawing inspiration from the Voting Rights Act enforcement, we delve into the exciting realm of maximizing simultaneous majority-minority districts within a political districting plan. While an unbiased random walk might falter in reaching this apex, an alternative in the form of a biased random walk emerges - directing focus on plans with a higher occurrence of majority-minority districts. Introducing a fresh perspective, we unveil \"short bursts\" as a novel approach. This method entails an unbiased random walk for a defined number of steps (referred to as burst length), followed by a restart from the most extreme plan discovered in the previous burst. Through empirical data, we demonstrate the superior performance of short bursts compared to biased random walks, particularly in enhancing the number of majority-minority districts.

While previous approaches typically sample different clips to form positive and negative pairs, this often leads to a bias towards background scenes. This bias arises from the fact that scene differences are more discernible than motion differences, and that clips from the same video often share similar backgrounds but distinct motions, misleading models to prioritize static scenes over motion patterns. To address this issue, our paper introduces a novel dual contrastive formulation, termed Dual Contrastive Learning for spatio-temporal Representation (DCLR). By decoupling RGB video sequences into static scenes and dynamic motion, we guide the model to encode both aspects in the compact RGB representation. Additionally, we employ activation maps to further refine static- and dynamic-related features.

In fact, systems may be unfairly penalized for generating text in less commonly represented dialects. As of now, there is no established method to measure how metrics adapt to changes in dialect.\n\nRecognizing the importance of dialect robustness and awareness in NLG evaluation, we introduce innovative approaches and statistical tests to evaluate metrics based on these principles. Our analysis of current state-of-the-art metrics reveals their limitations in handling dialect variations, with semantic alterations often affecting metrics less than the inclusion of dialect features.\n\nTo address this issue, we propose a novel training approach, NANO, which integrates regional and language-specific information into the metric pretraining process. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that NANO not only enhances models' ability to handle diverse dialects but also boosts their performance on standard metric benchmarks. This signifies a promising step towards developing more inclusive and effective NLG evaluation metrics.", "Sure, here's a more enthusiastic version of the text:\n\nGeographic routing is an incredibly innovative approach that leverages node positions to revolutionize the routing process!

These methods apply beamforming using time-frequency (TF)-masks estimated by the DNN, a technique commonly used in various applications for estimating spatial covariance matrices. The DNN training for mask-based beamforming relies on loss functions developed for monaural speech enhancement/separation. While this training criterion is straightforward, it does not directly reflect the performance of mask-based beamforming. To address this issue, we adopt multichannel loss functions that assess estimated spatial covariance matrices using the multichannel Itakura--Saito divergence. By training DNNs with these multichannel loss functions, we can create multiple beamformers.

It has been proven to outperform other methods in detecting out-of-distribution (OoD) and adversarial examples. In this study, we examine the reasons behind its exceptional performance, even though it relies on the unrealistic assumption that the class conditional distributions of pre-trained features share the same covariance.\n\nAlthough the Mahalanobis distance-based method claims to be inspired by classification prediction confidence, our analysis reveals that its success is actually due to information that is not directly related to classification tasks. This indicates that the effectiveness of the Mahalanobis confidence score may be misunderstood, as it leverages different information compared to ODIN, another popular OoD detection method based on prediction confidence.\n\nThis insight has led us to combine the Mahalanobis and ODIN methods, resulting in a combined detector that not only improves performance but also enhances robustness.

The second approach represents every expression in T using a structure value, and quoting and evaluating are operators within T.", "The research paper explores the dynamics of two interacting consumer-resource pairs by utilizing chemostat-like equations. It operates under the assumption that the resource's dynamics are notably slower than those of the consumer. By leveraging the presence of two distinct time scales in the system, the paper conducts a comprehensive analysis. This involves considering consumers and resources as fast-scale and slow-scale variables, respectively, within the coupled system. The analysis further delves into the developments in phase planes of these variables, treating them as independent entities. \n\nThe research findings illustrate that each isolated pair possesses a unique asymptotically stable steady state and does not exhibit self-sustained oscillatory behavior, although damped oscillations around the equilibrium are possible. Yet, when weakly linked through reciprocal inhibition of consumers, the entire system demonstrates self-sustained relaxation oscillations.

These observations were carried out using the InfraRed Camera (IRC) on the AKARI satellite and the Wide InfraRed Camera (WIRC) on the Palomar 5 m telescope. The images obtained at 4 um (N4), 7 um (S7), and 11 um (S11) bands with IRC, along with the 2.12 um image from WIRC showing H2 v=1->0 S(1), reveal similar diffuse features surrounding a shocked CO cloud. By comparing the emission to H2 line emissions from various shock models, we found that the color patterns seen in the IRC data can be explained well by a thermal blend model of H2 gas. This model suggests that the infinitesimal H2 column density is related to temperature $T$ through a power-law distribution, $dN\\sim T^{-b}dT$, with n(H2) $\\sim3.9\\times10^4$ cm^{-2}, $b\\sim4.2$, and N(H2;T>100K) $\\sim2.8\\times10^{21}$ cm^{-2. We examined these parameters in the context of different scenarios for shock-cloud interactions including multiple planar C-shocks, bow shocks, and shocked clumps, highlighting their respective strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThe observed intensity of H2 v=1->0 S(1) was found to be four times higher than predicted by the power-law blend model, a trend consistent with observations in the northern region of HB 21 as discussed in a previous study (Paper I). Additionally, we investigated the limitations of the thermal blend model in relation to the model parameters that were derived.", "Vision transformers have recently demonstrated impressive results that surpass large convolution-based models. However, for small models designed for mobile or resource-constrained devices, ConvNets still offer advantages in performance and model complexity.

This study aims to calibrate the Period-Luminosity relations in different photometric bands (ranging from B to K) within the Milky Way galaxy and compare them with established relations in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).

Our approach addresses stylistic differences between artistic modalities by training the network with a modality similar in style to the target domain. This method does not require labeled data from those artistic modalities and can work effectively with just ten unlabeled images. Our experiments show that this approach significantly enhances accuracy in artistic object recognition tasks compared to existing domain adaptation techniques.", "This study delves into the examination of the substantial time evolution of solutions to semi-linear Cauchy problems featuring quadratic nonlinearity in gradients. The Cauchy problem under scrutiny encompasses a broad state space and denotes the potential for degeneracy at the state space's boundary. Through rigorous analysis, two distinctive forms of substantial time behavior emerge: first, the pointwise convergence of both the solution and its gradient; and second, the convergence of solutions towards correlated backward stochastic differential equations. Notably, in cases where the state space is R^d or the realm of positive definite matrices, the achievement of both convergence types hinges on growth constraints imposed on the model coefficients. These consequential findings on substantial time convergence bear notable implications for risk-sensitive control strategies and decision-making processes in long-term portfolio management challenges.", "An intriguing approach known as the decaying vacuum model (DV) depicts dark energy as a dynamic vacuum that evolves over time. This concept, suggesting that vacuum energy diminishes proportionally with the Hubble parameter in later stages, $\\rho_\\Lambda(t) \\propto H(t)$, also generates an additional material component. By scrutinizing data from various sources such as supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, baryon acoustic oscillations, CMB observations, the Hubble rate, and x-rays from galaxy clusters, researchers have fine-tuned the DV model's parameters. Remarkably, the optimal fit for the matter density contrast $\\Omega_m$ in the DV model considerably surpasses that in the conventional $\\Lambda$CDM model. Confidence contours in the $\\Omega_m-h$ plane have been outlined up to a significant $3\\sigma$ confidence level. Additionally, the normalized likelihoods for $\\Omega_m$ and $h$ are meticulously presented.", "MgO-based Magnetic Tunnel Junctions oriented perpendicular to each other are considered ideal components for Spin Transfer Torque (STT) magnetoresistive memories.

They assume that human reasoning sets the standard for artificial reasoning. Topics like game theory, theory of mind, and machine learning all incorporate concepts used in human reasoning. These techniques help researchers replicate and understand human behavior. In the future, advanced autonomous systems will involve both AI agents and humans working together. To achieve this cooperation, autonomous agents must be able to model human behavior. This enables them not only to copy human actions as a way to learn but also to predict and understand human actions, allowing for true collaboration. This paper focuses on two primary areas related to modeling human behavior: (i) techniques like Reinforcement Learning that develop behavior models through exploration and feedback, and (ii) modeling human reasoning mechanisms such as beliefs and bias without relying solely on trial-and-error learning.", "Unraveling the complexity of botnets has always posed a daunting challenge, with the resilience of Command and Control (C&C) channels heightened and the identification of botmasters made even more elusive in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) botnets. In our groundbreaking study, we present an innovative probabilistic approach designed to reconstruct the intricate topologies of C&C channels within P2P botnets.\n\nGiven the widespread distribution of P2P botnet members, traditional monitoring methods prove inadequate, and the lack of comprehensive data complicates the application of existing graph reconstruction techniques. To date, a universal methodology that effectively reconstructs C&C channel topologies for all forms of P2P botnets remains elusive.\n\nOur approach hinges on estimating the likelihood of connections between bots based on the imprecise reception times of multiple data cascades, network model characteristics of C&C channels, and the distribution of end-to-end delays across the Internet. By observing how bots externally respond to commands, the reception times can be gathered.\n\nThrough detailed simulations, we demonstrate that our method can accurately determine over 90% of the connections within a 1000-node network, where nodes have an average degree of 50, by tracking the imprecise reception times of just 22 cascades. Even more impressively, achieving the same level of accuracy with data from only half of the bots requires monitoring 95 cascades.", "In some theories in physics, certain conditions for particle masses can vary at a large unification scale, which might impact how we can see certain types of particles at experiments like the LHC. We\u2019re looking into how these varied mass conditions affect the production of certain particles in a specific decay chain involving different particles interacting in high-energy collisions. We found that with these variations, we might be able to see different particles in certain regions, especially heavy neutral particles instead of lighter ones.

To tackle this issue, people are suggesting using data mining, biometrics, and extra authentication methods. Out of these, data mining seems to be a pretty good way to spot the unique traits of the car owner. Some smart folks have used different algorithms on driving data to figure out who the owner is. But there's a hitch \u2013 it's not easy to get enough info on how thieves drive. So, we came up with a new method using GAN for driver identification. GAN lets us create a model that learns only from the owner's data. We trained it this way, and the model could tell who the owner was based on their driving. Testing it with real driving data showed that our method is pretty accurate. By combining this idea with other security methods, we hope the car industry can make better theft-prevention tools for everyone.", "Are you curious about how slow oscillations of magnetoresistance can help us better understand the electronic structures of different metals?

What this means is that we're aiming to help the system acquire long-term knowledge to improve few-shot learning. The variational semantic memory is like a database that collects and keeps semantic information to help with the probabilistic inference of class prototypes, all within a hierarchical Bayesian framework.\n\nThis memory setup starts from scratch and gradually builds up its knowledge by learning from the tasks it deals with. Over time, it accumulates a wealth of general knowledge that allows it to grasp new concepts easily. To help with task-specific adjustments, we view memory recall as the variational inference of a latent memory variable based on specific contents.\n\nOur variational semantic memory acts as a new long-term memory tool, bringing in structured recall and update processes that efficiently gather and adapt semantic information for few-shot learning. Through experiments, we show how our probabilistic modelling of prototypes gives richer representations of object classes compared to using deterministic vectors.

Moreover, the performance of RNKN improves with more explicit evidence extracted from Chinese Electronic Medical Records (CEMRs) during training epochs.", "Multiple solenoids are typically integrated into an electron cooler apparatus to control the electron beam's trajectory. Nevertheless, these solenoids can also affect the path of the ion beam within the cooler's storage ring. If there is imperfect compensation for the solenoids within the electron cooler, the lateral movement of the ion beam in the storage ring will become interlinked. This study examines the intertwined transverse motion resulting from unadjusted solenoids in the electron cooler of the CSRm (the primary storage ring at the Institute of Modern Physics, located in Lan Zhou, China) and uses a novel approach to calculate the interrelated beam envelopes.", "A near-infrared excess is found at the white dwarf PHL5038 in UKIDSS photometry, indicating the presence of a cool, substellar companion.

The secondary's spectral type was determined using standard spectral indices. The binary has a projected orbital separation of 55AU, making it the second wide WD+dL binary known after GD165AB. This object has the potential to serve as a benchmark for testing substellar evolutionary models at intermediate to older ages.", "We're looking into how different flows and patterns in space affect our estimates of how fast stuff needs to go to leave galaxies the size of the Milky Way, as well as their total mass. We did this by studying the super-fast stars at the edges of our galaxy using some really detailed simulations that show us all the tiny details around where we are in the galaxy. We found that the patterns in space change a lot depending on where you look in a galaxy and in our simulations. These different patterns affect our mass estimates because they don't spread out evenly, which can mess with our calculations. After considering all these factors, we figured out the Milky Way's mass is probably around $1.29 ^{+0.37}_{-0.47} \\times 10^{12}$ times the mass of our Sun - according to our findings, that is!", "Information extraction rates exceeding one bit per photon are achieved by using high-dimensional correlated orbital angular momentum (OAM) states for object recognition, without employing traditional measurements in position space. It has been demonstrated that these correlations remain unaffected by axial rotation of the target object; the information structure of an object's joint OAM coincidence spectrum remains consistent even under random rotations between each measurement. Furthermore, OAM correlations alone have proven to be adequate for complete image reconstruction of complex, off-axis objects, revealing new symmetries in the phases of OAM-object interaction transition amplitudes.\n\nFurthermore, the study of variations in mutual information rates caused by off-axis translation in the beam field has shown that object symmetry signatures and information rates are not impacted by environmental factors far from the beam center. These findings suggest the potential for dynamic scanning applications in scenarios where symmetry and minimal noninvasive measurements are desired.", "In the first two orbits of the Parker Solar Probe, there has been a notable presence of rapid magnetic field reversals referred to as switchbacks. These switchbacks, commonly observed in the solar wind close to the Sun, seem to form in localized areas and could potentially be connected to diverse phenomena such as magnetic reconnection near the solar surface. Considering that switchbacks coincide with accelerated plasma movements, our exploration focused on understanding whether they are hotter than the surrounding plasma and if the internal microphysics within a switchback differ from its vicinity. By analyzing the reduced distribution functions acquired from the Solar Probe Cup instrument during moments of substantial angular deviations, we compared the parallel temperatures within and outside switchbacks. Our findings suggest that the reduced distribution functions within switchbacks align with a uniform phase space rotation of the ambient plasma. Consequently, we deduce that the proton core's parallel temperature remains consistent both inside and outside switchbacks, indicating a lack of a direct temperature-velocity relationship for the proton core within these magnetic field fluctuations. Additionally, our investigations propose that switchbacks exhibit characteristics of Alfv\\'enic pulses traveling along open magnetic field lines, although the precise origin of these pulses remains unidentified. Moreover, our analysis uncovered no apparent correlation between radial Poynting flux and enhancements in kinetic energy, suggesting that the radial Poynting flux may not significantly influence the dynamics of switchbacks.", "Revamp of the Nainital-Cape Survey unveiled a thrilling find - eight $\\delta\\,$Scuti type pulsators pulsating dynamically within minutes to a few hours range. To decipher the celestial dance of these mesmerizing pulsators, we delved into the realm of non-adiabatic linear stability analyses within stellar models spanning masses from 1 to 3 M$_{\\odot}$. Our exploration unearthed numerous unstable low order p-modes whose pulsation periods harmonize beautifully with the observed timings. Notably, with a focus on HD$\\,$118660, HD$\\,$113878, HD$\\,$102480, HD$\\,$98851, and HD$\\,$25515, we illustrated how the enigmatic variabilities align poetically with the rhythmic low order radial p-mode pulsations.", "A fresh perspective on classical mechanics in theories with violations of Lorentz symmetry is introduced. By utilizing the extended Hamiltonian formalism, a connection is made between the covariant Lagrangian and Hamiltonian forms through a Legendre Transformation. With this method, trajectories can be calculated using Hamilton's equations in momentum space and the Euler-Lagrange equations in velocity space while avoiding singular points inherent in the theory. These singular points can be resolved by ensuring that the trajectories are continuous functions of both velocity and momentum. Moreover, specific solutions for the Lagrangian can be pinpointed by analyzing certain sheets of the dispersion relations. Detailed examples based on bipartite Finsler functions are provided. Furthermore, a special case demonstrates a direct link between Lagrangians and solutions to the Dirac equation in field theory.", "Spectrum management has been recognized as a crucial step in enabling the technology of a cognitive radio network (CRN). Most existing studies on spectrum management in CRNs focus on individual tasks such as spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum sharing, or spectrum mobility. In this two-part paper, we argue that simultaneously performing multiple spectrum management tasks can enhance spectrum efficiency for certain network configurations. Specifically, we aim to investigate the uplink resource management issue in a CRN that involves multiple cognitive users (CUs) and access points (APs). In order to optimize their uplink transmission rates, CUs need to select a suitable AP (spectrum decision) and share channels with other CUs associated with the same AP (spectrum sharing). These tasks are interconnected, and the optimal decentralized approach to efficiently carry them out remains an open question in the literature.", "A statistical model is introduced for describing baryonic matter in core-collapsing supernova conditions. The model exhibits a first-order phase transition in the grandcanonical ensemble that is absent in the canonical ensemble. This behavior results from the interplay of short-range strong forces and long-range electromagnetic interactions in baryonic matter, moderated by electron screening. The findings have implications for supernova dynamics.", "In order to achieve high performance in the THz-FEL (Free Electron Laser) system, a new compact FEL injector design has been proposed. By opting for a thermionic cathode over a complex and expensive photo-cathode, the injector is able to emit electrons efficiently. The introduction of an enhanced EC-ITC (External Cathode Independently Tunable Cells) RF gun allows for an improved effective bunch charge of approximately 200pC, while virtually eliminating back bombardment effects. The inclusion of constant gradient accelerator structures boosts energy levels to around 14MeV, and a specialized focusing system helps maintain emittance control and bunch stability. Comprehensive analyses of the physical design and beam dynamics of the injector's key components were conducted. Furthermore, extensive start-to-end simulations involving multiple pulses were carried out using dedicated MATLAB and Parmela software. The outcomes confirm the system's capability to consistently generate high-brightness electron bunches with minimal energy dispersion and emittance, ensuring stable operation.", "The research findings about anomalies in the large-angle properties of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy as measured by WMAP are nothing short of thrilling! Despite the challenges in assessing their statistical significance due to the nature of the data used, the potential for uncovering new physics on the grandest observable scales is truly captivating! We are diving into three key claims: the intriguing lack of large-angle power, the fascinating north-south power asymmetry, and the mysterious multipole alignments. Overcoming the hurdle of a posteriori statistics can be conquered by seeking out a fresh dataset that delves into similar physical scales as the large-angle CMB. While this task may be daunting, the journey towards this goal is lined with exciting possibilities! Let's embark on this adventure together and explore the wonders that await!", "Multi-photon states can be generated through multiple parametric down conversion (PDC) processes where a high-power pump is used on the nonlinear crystal. The higher the population of these states, the stronger the discrepancy with local realistic description. Despite this, the interference contrast in multi-photon PDC experiments can be low when high pumping is applied. We present a method to enhance this contrast using multiport beam splitters, optical devices that can split light into multiple output modes. Our approach acts as a POVM filter and could enable practical CHSH-Bell inequality tests, offering potential applications in reducing communication complexity.", "The analysis of the exponents of the transfer matrix spectrum offers crucial insights into the localization lengths of Anderson's model governing a particle's behavior in a disordered potential lattice. By establishing a profound duality identity for determinants and leveraging Jensen's identity for subharmonic functions, I derive a definitive formula that encapsulates the spectrum through the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian, accentuating the significance of non-Hermitian boundary conditions. This formula, which is absolute in its precision, necessitates an average across a Bloch phase rather than disorder for comprehensive comprehension. Furthermore, a meticulous exploration of non-Hermitian spectrums in the context of Anderson's model in dimensions 1 and 2, focusing on the minimum exponent, is meticulously presented.", "In this exciting piece, we level up extreme learning machines for regression challenges by incorporating a cool graph signal processing based tweak. Imagine predicting or regressing a graph signal as your target - that's the cool assumption we're playing with here. By adding in this special regularization, we ensure that the extreme learning machine's output flows seamlessly across the graph. Our simulations with real-world data back this up, showing that this tweak brings a big boost, especially when your training data is limited and noisy.", "To provide a comprehensive understanding of heating in weakly collisional turbulent plasmas like the solar wind, it is crucial to consider inter-particle collisions. These collisions play a vital role in transforming ordered energy into heat through irreversible relaxation towards thermal equilibrium. A recent study by Pezzi et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 116, 2016, p. 145001) revealed that the collisionality of the plasma is intensified by the presence of intricate structures in velocity space.\n\nExpanding on this analysis, the comparison between the fully nonlinear Landau operator and a linearized Landau operator is conducted to examine their respective impacts. By investigating the relaxation process towards equilibrium of a non-equilibrium distribution function in a force-free plasma, it becomes evident that retaining nonlinearities in the collisional operator is essential for accurately assessing the significance of collisional effects.\n\nAlthough both the nonlinear and linearized operators exhibit characteristic times associated with the dissipation of phase space structures, their influences differ. The study indicates that in the case of the linearized operator, the characteristic times are consistently longer compared to the fully nonlinear operator. This observation suggests that neglecting nonlinearities in the collisional operator results in a slower dissipation of fine velocity structures.", "In this research study, we have illustrated the utilization of Mask-RCNN (Regional Convolutional Neural Network), a deep-learning algorithm designed for computer vision and specifically object detection, within the semiconductor defect inspection domain. The identification and classification of stochastic defects during semiconductor manufacturing have become increasingly complex due to the consistent reduction in circuit pattern dimensions, such as pitches below 32 nm. The examination and assessment of defects using state-of-the-art optical and e-beam inspection tools are primarily influenced by rule-based techniques, often leading to misclassification and therefore requiring expert intervention. In this investigation, we have revisited and extended our previous deep learning-based method for defect classification and detection to enhance defect instance segmentation in Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images. This advancement allows for precise delineation of defect extents and the generation of masks for each defect category or instance. Furthermore, it facilitates the extraction and calibration of each segmented mask, enabling pixel quantification within each mask. Consequently, we can accurately count categorical defect instances and compute the surface area in terms of pixels. Our objective is to detect and segment various types of inter-class stochastic defect patterns, such as bridges, breaks, and line collapses, as well as to differentiate between intra-class multi-categorical defect bridge scenarios (e.g., thin/single/multi-line/horizontal/non-horizontal) for aggressive pitches and thin resists (High Numerical Aperture applications). Our proposed methodology demonstrates effectiveness both quantitatively and qualitatively.", "We present a new bound for the parameter $\\lambda$ in a distance-regular graph $G$, which enhances and broadens the existing bounds for strongly regular graphs set by Spielman (1996) and Pyber (2014). This new bound plays a crucial role in recent advances concerning the complexity of testing isomorphism in strongly regular graphs as demonstrated by Babai, Chen, Sun, Teng, and Wilmes in 2013. The proof leverages a clique geometry identified by Metsch (1991) while adhering to certain parameter constraints. Additionally, we offer a simplified proof of an asymptotic implication stemming from Metsch's discovery: when $k\\mu = o(\\lambda^2)$, every edge in $G$ belongs to a lone maximal clique of size approximately equal to $\\lambda$, with all other cliques having a size of $o(\\lambda)$. Here, $k$ signifies the degree while $\\mu$ indicates the number of common neighbors between adjacent vertices at a distance of 2. Notably, Metsch's cliques demonstrate an \"asymptotically Delsarte\" nature under the condition $k\\mu = o(\\lambda^2$, implying that groups of distance-regular graphs with parameters satisfying $k\\mu = o(\\lambda^2)$ exhibit an \"asymptotically Delsarte-geometric\" property.", "Recent studies indicate that the activity of star formation in galaxies varies depending on their environments. To comprehend the diversity of star formation on a galactic scale, it is essential to investigate the formation and evolution of giant molecular clouds in extreme settings. This study specifically looks into the phenomenon where strongly barred galaxies lack massive stars despite having sufficient molecular gas for star formation. By conducting a hydrodynamical simulation of a strongly barred galaxy using the stellar potential extracted from observations of NGC1300, the researchers compare cloud properties in different galactic regions: bars, bar-ends, and spiral arms. The analysis shows that the average virial parameter of clouds is approximately 1 and is not influenced by the environment, suggesting that the gravitational binding of the cloud is not the cause of the observed absence of massive stars in strong bars. Instead, the focus is on cloud-cloud collisions as a potential trigger for massive star formation, with faster collision speeds noted in bars compared to other regions. The collision frequency is evaluated based on cloud kinematics, indicating that the higher collision speeds in bars may result from the elliptical gas orbits perturbed by the bar potential, leading to random-like motion and fast cloud-cloud collisions. Therefore, it is proposed that the dearth of active star formation in strong bars may be linked to the inefficient formation of massive stars due to fast cloud-cloud collisions driven by vigorous galactic-scale gas movements.", "Summary: The relationship between galaxy mass and metallicity is widely studied, but there is still debate over its exact nature. Our goal is to analyze this relationship in the GAMA survey, comparing it to the one from SDSS and exploring how different criteria affect the results. We determine metallicity using emission line ratios and find that the shape of the relationship can vary based on calibration and selection criteria. Despite differences, we find a reasonable agreement between GAMA and SDSS data. It is important to be cautious when comparing results from different studies due to the impact of selection criteria. We also suggest there may be some evolution within the GAMA sample over certain redshift ranges.", "We derive equations for seepage velocities of fluid components in two-phase flow in porous media based on thermodynamics. These equations involve a new velocity function called co-moving velocity, which is specific to the porous medium. By incorporating a constitutive relation between velocities and driving forces like pressure gradient, we have a complete set of equations. We analyze four variations of the capillary tube model analytically using this theory and validate it numerically on a network model.", "The amazing creativity of nature, shown in the wide variety of life forms and functions on Earth, is a key feature that separates living organisms from non-living entities. This aspect of life is a central focus in the study of artificial life due to its connection with the process of evolution. Researchers have labeled this creative process as Open-Ended Evolution (OEE). This article introduces the second of two special issues on current research in OEE, providing an overview of the content. Most of the work discussed was presented at an open-ended evolution workshop during the 2018 Conference on Artificial Life in Tokyo, with previous workshops held in Cancun and York. The article offers a simplified categorization of OEE and a summary of the progress in the field represented in this special issue.", "We examined the properties of MgO/Ag(001) ultrathin films with substitutional Mg atoms at the interface layer through Auger electron diffraction experiments, ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Taking advantage of the layer-by-layer details in the Mg KL_23 L_23 Auger spectra and employing multiple scattering calculations, we initially identified interlayer distances and morphological parameters of the MgO/Ag(001) system with and without Mg atoms integrated at the interface. Our findings indicate that the incorporation of Mg atoms leads to a significant distortion of the interface layers, resulting in a noteworthy reduction of the work function (0.5 eV) due to variations in the band offsets at the interface. These experimental results align closely with our DFT simulations, which accurately reproduce the lattice distortion induced by the Mg atoms at the interface. Furthermore, a Bader analysis reveals that an increase in the Mg concentration at the interface triggers an electron transfer from Mg to Ag atoms within the metallic interface layer. We observe that while the local lattice distortion arises from the interactions between the ions and neighboring atoms, its impact on the work function reduction remains limited. Lastly, we analyze the work function changes caused by the interface Mg atoms in terms of charge transfer, rumpling, and electrostatic compression effects. Our assessment underscores that the alterations in the work function of the metal/oxide system with interface Mg atoms predominantly stem from the rise in the electrostatic compression effect.", "This passage discusses the importance of monitoring industrial processes to detect changes in process parameters promptly and correct any arising problems. A challenge arises when the measured value falls below the sensitivity or detection limits, leading to incomplete observations or left-censored data. Traditional monitoring methods are not suitable when there is a high level of censorship, exceeding 70%. Therefore, proper statistical techniques are necessary to assess the process's actual state. The paper suggests a method to estimate process parameters in such situations and introduces a corresponding control chart algorithm.", "This paper introduces Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC), a method that simultaneously learns feature representations and cluster assignments using deep neural networks. DEC optimizes a clustering objective by mapping data to a lower-dimensional feature space. Experimental evaluations on image and text corpora demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods.", "We enhance a study that focused on how the peak transmission rate affects network burstiness by Sarvotham et al. [2005]. We group TCP packets into sessions using a 5-tuple (source, destination, total payload, duration, average transmission rate, peak transmission rate, initiation time). Our new definition of peak rate is introduced after careful analysis. In contrast to Sarvotham et al. [2005], who categorized sessions into alpha and beta groups, we divide them into 10 sessions based on empirical quantiles of the peak rate variable, showing that the beta group is not homogeneous. This more refined division uncovers additional structures that were not discerned by the grouping into two segments. We analyze the relationships between total payload, duration, and average transmission rate within each segment and note variations across the groups. Additionally, we observe that session initiation times in each segment follow a Poisson process, which is not the case for the dataset as a whole. Our findings highlight the importance of the peak rate level in understanding network structure and in creating accurate data simulations. Finally, we present a straightforward method for simulating network traffic based on our research.", "The Brouwer fixed-point theorem in topology implies that any continuous mapping $f$ from a compact convex set to itself has a fixed point, where $f(x_0) = x_0$. Under specific circumstances, this fixed point is associated with the throat of a traversable wormhole, represented by $b(r_0) = r_0$ for the shape function $b = b(r)$. Therefore, the potential presence of wormholes can be inferred solely from mathematical principles without exceeding current physical constraints.", "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become increasingly popular in the fields of computer vision and medical image analysis. However, while most CNN approaches can only handle 2D images, the majority of medical data in clinical practice is in the form of 3D volumes. In our innovative study, we present a cutting-edge solution for 3D image segmentation using a fully convolutional neural network tailored for volumetric data. Focusing on MRI volumes of the prostate, our CNN is trained end-to-end to predict segmentations for entire volumes all at once. We've devised a novel objective function based on the Dice coefficient to address imbalances between foreground and background voxels. To overcome the challenge of limited annotated training data, we have implemented data augmentation techniques like non-linear transformations and histogram matching. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves impressive performance on complex test data, all while significantly reducing processing time compared to existing methods.", "Certainly! The spectrum of a non-relativistic two-body system interacting via the Coulomb potential manifests as the Balmer series $E_n=\\frac{\\alpha^2m}{4n^2}$ according to the Schr\\\"odinger equation. Wick and Cutkosky's 1954 research, within the Bethe-Salpeter equation framework, revealed that relativistic effects introduce new energy levels when $\\alpha>\\frac{\\pi}{4}$, supplementing the Balmer series. Nevertheless, the interpretation of these additional states remained ambiguous, leading to doubts about their existence. Our recent findings indicate that these extra states are predominantly influenced by the exchange (massless) particles moving at the speed of light. This characteristic explains why they were not accounted for in the non-relativistic (Schr\\\"odinger) framework.", "We delve into the intriguing world of quantum mechanics to explore the essence of quantum f-relative entropy, where f(.) represents an operator convex function. The quest leads us to unveil novel insights, shedding light on the equality conditions imbued with notions of monotonicity and joint convexity that transcend the known boundaries. We break new ground by discovering that these conditions resonate across a spectrum of operator convex functions, setting the stage for a fascinating journey of discovery.\n\nThe quantum f-entropy emerges as a cornerstone of our exploration, forged in the crucible of quantum f-relative entropy. We unravel its intricate properties, unveiling the subtle interplay of equality conditions in select scenarios. As our expedition unfolds, we trace the evolution of f-generalizations, such as the enigmatic Holevo information, entanglement-assisted capacity, and coherent information. Their journey culminates in an elegant dance of data processing inequality, where we discern the echoes of perfection in the realm of f-coherent information.", "Modifying the position or angle of an image should not impact the outcomes of various computer vision tasks. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are inherently invariant to image translations due to the way input images are processed into feature maps, the same cannot be said for image rotations. Achieving overall rotational invariance is typically done through data augmentation. However, establishing invariance to patch-wise rotations is more challenging. In this regard, we introduce Harmonic Networks (H-Nets), a type of CNN specifically designed to be equivariant to both patch-wise translations and full 360-degree rotations. This is accomplished by utilizing circular harmonic filters instead of standard CNN filters, resulting in maximal responses and orientations for every local patch in the input image. H-Nets offer a robust representation that is efficient in terms of parameters and computational complexity, with evidence suggesting that the network's deep feature maps encompass intricate rotational properties. Our framework is versatile and can be integrated successfully with cutting-edge architectural designs and methodologies like deep supervision and batch normalization. Our experiments demonstrate that by leveraging H-Nets, we achieve top-tier performance in classifying rotated-MNIST images and competitive outcomes across several standardized tests.", "We study and analyze reflection spectra of waveguides and cavities that are directly connected. The Fano lines we observe provide valuable insights into the reflection and coupling mechanisms. Unlike with side-coupled systems, the shape of the observed Fano line is not determined by the waveguide ends, but by the coupling process between the measurement device fiber and the waveguide. Our experimental findings and analytical model indicate that the Fano parameter governing the Fano line shape is highly influenced by the coupling state. Even a small shift of the fiber, well below the Rayleigh range, can dramatically alter the shape of the Fano line.", "We introduce a new technique to measure atmospheric turbulence in optical and infrared telescopes using short-exposure images of a star field. By calculating differential motion between pairs of star images, we can determine wavefront tilt's structure functions for various angular separations. This method, compared with theoretical turbulence predictions using a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo optimization, estimates the lower atmospheric turbulence profile, total seeing, free-atmosphere seeing, and outer scale. We validate the technique with Monte-Carlo simulations and demonstrate examples from data collected by the second AST3 telescope at Dome A in Antarctica.", "An n-plectic structure is defined as a commutative and torsionless Lie Rinehart pair, accompanied by a distinguished cocycle from its Chevalley-Eilenberg complex. This 'n-plectic cocycle' paves the way for extending the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex with symplectic tensors. The cohomology of this extension expands the scope of Hamiltonian functions and vector fields to tensors and cotensors across various degrees, accounting for specific coboundaries, and taking the form of a Lie \u221e-algebra. Moreover, we establish that momentum maps manifest in this framework through weak Lie \u221e-morphisms from any Lie \u221e-algebra to the Lie \u221e-algebra of Hamiltonian (co)tensors.", "Amorphous solids or glasses are known to display stretched-exponential decay across wide time scales in various measurable properties such as intermediate scattering function, dielectric relaxation modulus, and time-elastic modulus. This behavior is particularly noticeable close to the glass transition. In this communication, we illustrate the connection between stretched-exponential relaxation and the distinctive lattice dynamics of glasses using the dielectric relaxation as an example. By revising the Lorentz model for dielectric materials in a more comprehensive manner, we present the dielectric response as a function of the vibrational density of states (DOS) for a random collection of harmonically interacting spherical particles with their nearest neighbors. Remarkably, we observe that in proximity to the glass transition of this system (coinciding with the Maxwell rigidity transition), the dielectric relaxation aligns perfectly with stretched-exponential behavior, characterized by Kohlrausch exponents in the range of $0.56 < \\beta < 0.65$, which is consistent with measurements in numerous experimental setups. Importantly, we identify the underlying soft modes (boson-peak) in the DOS as the fundamental cause of stretched-exponential relaxation.", "This paper aims to demonstrate the challenges of achieving representation disentanglement in text using unsupervised methods. We analyze a selection of successful models from the image domain across 6 disentanglement metrics, classification tasks, and homotopy. Our evaluation uses two synthetic datasets with known generative factors to showcase the disparity in the text domain and how factors like representation sparsity and decoder coupling can influence disentanglement. This study serves as the initial exploration of unsupervised representation disentanglement in text and presents a foundation for future research in this area.", "This paper introduces a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for addressing the unit commitment (UC) problem in power systems. The algorithm decomposes the UC problem into three subproblems - a quadratic subproblem, a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) subproblem, and an unconstrained quadratic subproblem. A classical optimization solver handles the first and third subproblems, while the QUBO subproblem is solved with the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). The subproblems are coordinated iteratively using a three-block alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm. Simulation results using Qiskit on the IBM Q system confirm the effectiveness of the algorithm in solving the UC problem.", "The discovery of numerous very low amplitude modes in Delta Sct stars has been attributed to improved signal-to-noise ratios. CoRoT, a space mission by CNES, aims to uncover this hidden treasure inaccessible from the ground. This study focuses on HD 50844, analyzing 140,016 data points using various methods and verification steps. Achieving an amplitude spectrum level of 10^{-5} mag in the CoRoT dataset, the frequency analysis reveals a multitude of terms between 0 and 30 d^{-1}. Confirming the rich frequency content of Delta Sct stars, spectroscopic mode identification supports this, detecting high-degree modes up to ell=14. Cancellation effects at the noise level of CoRoT measurements do not fully eliminate flux variations associated with these modes. Ground-based observations indicate that HD 50844, an evolved star slightly deficient in heavy elements, lies on the Terminal Age Main Sequence. The frequency distribution lacks a clear regular pattern, possibly due to its evolutionary stage. The dominant term (f_1=6.92 d^{-1}) is identified as the fundamental radial mode using ground-based photometric and spectroscopic data. This study also incorporates observations from ESO telescopes under the ESO Large Programme LP178.D-0361 and data from the Observatorio de Sierra Nevada, Observatorio Astronomico Nacional San Pedro Martir, and Konkoly Observatory's Piszkesteto Mountain Station.", "The captivating article explores the mysterious world of star formation in the enchanting regions of S231-S235 within a colossal molecular cloud named G174+2.5. Our adventure began by combing through archive data to identify massive molecular clumps, from which we meticulously extracted key details such as mass, size, and CO column density. With our targets in sight, we set out to capture groundbreaking observations. Excitingly, our exploration led us to the first-ever sighting of ammonia and cyanoacetylene lines in the molecular clumps WB89 673 and WB89 668, hinting at the presence of high-density gas. Delving deeper into the molecular mysteries, we unraveled essential physical properties of the gas, revealing a temperature range of 16-30 K and a hydrogen number density varying from 2.8 to 7.2$\\times10^3$ cm$^{-3}$. Notably, a thrilling discovery awaited us as we detected a shock-tracing line of the CH$_3$OH molecule at 36.2 GHz, casting new light on the enigmatic WB89 673 clump.", "We present new observations of gamma-ray burst (GRB) 171205A using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT), covering a frequency range from 250 to 1450 MHz over a period of 4 to 937 days. This is the first GRB afterglow detected in the 250-500 MHz range and the second brightest GRB observed with the uGMRT. Despite being visible for nearly 1000 days, there is no sign of a transition to a non-relativistic regime. We analyze archival Chandra X-ray data at around day 70 and day 200, finding no evidence of a jet break. Our modeling of the synchrotron afterglow emission suggests a relativistic, isotropic, self-similar deceleration process and a shock-breakout from a wide-angle cocoon. Our findings indicate that the GRB occurred in a stratified wind-like medium rather than a standard constant density environment. The combined data suggest that the radio afterglow contains contributions from both a weak, slightly off-axis jet and a wider cocoon, with the cocoon likely dominating initially and the jet taking over later, leading to flatter radio light curves.", "The newly established concept of quasi-Lie schemes has been the subject of thorough examination and practical application in delving into various equations of Emden type. A structured methodology has been developed to specifically address these equations and their extensions. Through this approach, we are able to discern time-dependent constants of motion associated with specific cases of Emden equations utilizing their corresponding solutions. This exploration has uncovered previously documented findings from a fresh vantage point. Moreover, time-dependent constants of motion for Emden-type equations meeting specific criteria have been revealed through this comprehensive analysis.", "We investigate the charged Higgs bosons as proposed in the model based on gauge symmetry $SU(3)_c \\otimes SU(3)_L \\otimes U(1)_X$. By analyzing Yukawa mixing couplings at both small ($\\sim$ GeV) and large ($\\sim$ TeV) scales, we demonstrate that the model predicts hypercharge-one $H_1^{\\pm}$ and hypercharge-two $H_2^{\\pm}$ Higgs bosons, which can be simultaneously generated in $pp$ collisions with varying production rates. At lower energy levels, the properties of $H_1^{\\pm}$ closely resemble those of charged Higgs bosons in a two Higgs doublet model (2HDM), while $H_2^{\\pm}$ are additional like-charged Higgs bosons arising from the underlying 3-3-1 model. Identifying multiple like-charged Higgs boson resonances could serve as a test of theoretical models against experimental observations. We explore the production of $H_{1,2}^{\\pm}$ pairs and associated $tbH_{1,2}^{\\pm}$ particles at the CERN LHC collider. Notably, we find that pair production rates can be comparable to single production rates in gluon-gluon collisions due to the involvement of a heavy neutral $Z'$ gauge boson predicted by the model. When considering decays to leptons such as $H_{1,2}^{\\pm} \\rightarrow \\tau \\nu_{\\tau}$, we identify scenarios where small peaks of $H_{2}^{\\pm}$-boson events in transverse mass distributions stand out above the $H_{1}^{\\pm}$ background.", "Isospin breaking in the $K_{\\ell 4}$ form factors, caused by the difference between charged and neutral pion masses, is discussed in a framework that uses dispersion representations. The $K_{\\ell 4}$ form factors are developed iteratively up to two loops in a low-energy expansion, incorporating analyticity, crossing, and unitarity with two-meson intermediate states. We present analytical expressions for the phases of the two-loop form factors in the $K^\\pm\\to\\pi^+\\pi^- e^\\pm \\nu_e$ channel, which help to link experimental measurements of form-factor phase shifts outside the isospin limit with theoretical studies on $S$- and $P$-wave $\\pi\\pi$ phase shifts within the isospin limit. We study the dependence on the two $S$-wave scattering lengths $a_0^0$ and $a_0^2$ in a general manner, different from previous analyses based on one-loop chiral perturbation theory. By revisiting results from the NA48/2 collaboration at CERN SPS, we reanalyze the phases of $K^\\pm\\to\\pi^+\\pi^- e^\\pm \\nu_e$ form factors to extract values for the scattering lengths $a_0^0$ and $a_0^2, taking into account isospin-breaking corrections.", "In this article, we build upon and expand the findings of previous studies in \\cite{1,2,3,4}, with a particular focus on the work in \\cite{4}, to analyze the statistical characteristics of the cosmological constant in a cosmological de Sitter universe in relation to massless excitations with Planckian effects. Our analysis reveals that in a classical context, a positive cosmological constant $\\Lambda>0$ can only be achieved as the temperature $T$ approaches zero. Similar to the scenario of black holes, when accounting for quantum effects, a formulation for $\\Lambda$ can be established using massless excitations, with quantum corrections to the Misner-Sharp mass playing a crucial role. Furthermore, quantum fluctuations lead to the emergence of an effective cosmological constant that varies depending on the scale being observed, offering a potential resolution to the cosmological constant dilemma without requiring the introduction of a quintessence field. The modest value of $\\Lambda$ could be attributed to the presence of a quantum decoherence scale beyond the Planck length, which results in the evolution of spacetime resembling a pure de Sitter universe with a small average cosmological constant inherent in the system's lowest energy state.", "Key points:\n\n- Investigation of zero and finite temperature properties of the one-dimensional spin-glass model for vector spins with an infinite number of spin components.\n- Interactions decay with a power, sigma, of the distance.\n- Diluted version of the model deviates significantly from the fully connected model.\n- Defect energies at zero temperature determined by comparing ground-state energies with periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions.\n- Dependence of the defect-energy exponent theta on sigma: theta = 3/4 - sigma.\n- Upper critical value of sigma is 3/4, corresponding to the lower critical dimension in the short-range model.\n- For finite temperatures, solving large m saddle-point equations self-consistently provides correlation function, order parameter, and spin-glass susceptibility.\n- Different forms of finite-size scaling effects below and above the lower critical value, sigma = 5/8, corresponding to the upper critical dimension 8 of the short-range model.", "The rare Of^+ supergiants occupy a unique position between standard O-stars and Wolf-Rayet stars. Recent discoveries reveal striking parallels with WN-type objects, particularly in the visible and near-infrared spectra, hinting at shared stellar wind characteristics. Our groundbreaking study unveils the inaugural X-ray observations of HD16691 (O4If^+) and HD14947 (O5f^+), which showcase a gentle thermal profile aligning with the anticipated X-ray output of a single O-type star. Nonetheless, the X-ray brightness of these stars falls slightly below expectations for solitary O-type stars, pointing to the profound influence of their peculiar stellar wind properties on X-ray emissions as they transition towards the WN category. We propose that the diminished X-ray radiance of HD16691 and HD14947 reflects their distinctive status between O and WR stars, brought about by heightened wind density.", "The goal of the AARTFAAC project is to deploy an All-Sky Monitor (ASM) utilizing the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) telescope. This will facilitate continuous monitoring of low frequency radio transients across a large portion of the sky visible to the LOFAR telescope, with real-time capabilities spanning from milliseconds to several days. Furthermore, it will allow for immediate follow-up observations by the complete LOFAR system upon detection of possible transient events. Implementing this system comes with various challenges, including the need for all-sky imaging, low processing latencies, sustained availability, and independent operation of the ASM. Notably, the correlator for the ASM is currently the world's largest in terms of input channel count, producing around 1.5 x 10^5 correlations per second per spectral channel. Initial tests were conducted using existing LOFAR resources to establish essential instrumental design parameters for the ASM. This paper provides an outline of the AARTFAAC data processing pipeline and showcases some of the challenges encountered through all-sky images captured during test observations, offering insightful metrics on the instrument's capabilities.", "Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are matured forms of massive O-type stars and are considered as potential sources for Type Ib/c core-collapse supernovae (SNe). We present findings from our study on Wolf-Rayet stars in M101, focusing on the effectiveness of narrow-band optical imaging compared to broad-band techniques. Our results reveal that, on average, 42% of WR stars, increasing to approximately 85% in central areas, can only be identified through narrow-band imaging. Therefore, the absence of a WR star in the vicinity of around 10 Type Ib/c SNe in broad-band imaging is no longer conclusive evidence against a WR star being the progenitor source."]
