["Process calculi grounded in logic, such as \u03c0DILL and CP, provide a solid foundation for deadlock-free concurrent programming. However, a discrepancy has existed between the proof construction rules and the term constructors of the \u03c0-calculus, specifically with regard to the fundamental operator for parallel composition, which lacks a corresponding rule in linear logic. To address this mismatch, Kokke et al. (2019) introduced Hypersequent Classical Processes (HCP), which leverages hypersequents (collections of sequents) to capture parallelism in typing judgments. Nevertheless, the transition from CP to HCP is a significant one. Currently, HCP lacks reduction semantics, and the incorporation of delayed actions means that CP processes interpreted as HCP processes do not exhibit the same behavior as they would in CP. To bridge this gap, we propose HCP-, a variant of HCP that incorporates reduction semantics and eliminates delayed actions. We establish progress, preservation, and termination properties for HCP- and demonstrate that it supports the same communication protocols as CP.", "Let's talk about a simplified version of the BDDC preconditioner. Essentially, we're imposing constraints on a select group of subobjects - think subdomain subedges, subfaces, and vertices between pairs of subedges. The good news is that we can prove the condition number of this preconditioner is capped at C(1 + log(L/h))^2, where C is a constant and h and L represent the characteristic sizes of the mesh and subobjects, respectively. The beauty of this is that we have a lot of flexibility in choosing L, which means we can theoretically get the condition number down to O(1). We'll dive into the advantages and disadvantages of this preconditioner, as well as how it performs when applied to heterogeneous problems. And to top it off, we'll share some numerical results from our supercomputer simulations.", "We provide examples of the Heun function as solutions to wave equations in general relativity. Specifically, we show that the Dirac equation in the Nutku helicoid metric background yields Mathieu functions in 4D spacetime, but in 5D spacetime, it leads to the double confluent Heun function. We demonstrate how to reduce this solution to the Mathieu function using specific transformations. Additionally, we apply Atiyah-Patodi-Singer spectral boundary conditions to account for the metric's singularity at the origin.", "Scientists have long been puzzled by the slow decline in X-ray activity during long-duration solar flares. Research suggests that this phenomenon can only be explained by a continuous process of magnetic reconnection and energy release in the corona, the outer atmosphere of the sun. Our team used data from the RHESSI spacecraft to investigate two key questions: How efficient is this energy release process during the decay phase of long-duration flares, and can we accurately calculate the rate of energy release from this data? To answer these questions, we reconstructed images of selected flares during their decay phase and analyzed the physical properties of the coronal sources. This allowed us to study the effectiveness of the energy release process and evaluate the accuracy of each component involved in the energy equation.", "We uncover the characteristic geometric structure of clusters in random media under the FK measure through a multi-scale analysis, with implications holding in all dimensions greater than or equal to 2, contingent on slab percolation under the averaged measure - a condition expected to be met throughout the supercritical phase. This breakthrough builds upon Pisztora's work, providing a crucial framework for understanding the supercritical regime in disordered FK, Ising, and Potts models.", "Classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) exhibit weak photospheric absorption lines, a phenomenon known as veiling. This veiling is typically attributed to excess continuous emission generated by shock-heated gas at the stellar surface, beneath the accretion streams. To investigate the relationship between veiling, stellar brightness, and emission line strengths, we selected four CTTS with exceptionally strong veiling: RW Aur A, RU Lup, S CrA NW, and S CrA SE. We monitored these stars through photometric and spectroscopic observations at multiple epochs.\n\nAccording to standard accretion models, variations in the accretion rate should lead to changes in excess emission, resulting in corresponding fluctuations in stellar brightness. However, our findings indicate that the veiling of absorption lines in these stars is highly variable and often so extreme that it would require the release of multiple stellar luminosities of potential energy. Surprisingly, the veiling factors derived during periods of high line dilution show only a weak correlation with brightness. Furthermore, the emission line strengths do not follow the expected trend with veiling.\n\nWe observed that veiling can change dramatically within a single night and is not correlated with the rotation periods of the two stars for which this data is available. In at least three of the stars, high veiling is accompanied by the filling-in of photospheric lines with line emission, resulting in large veiling factors unrelated to changes in continuous emission from shocked regions. We also explored the impact of dust extinction and electron scattering in the accretion stream on veiling measurements in CTTS.\n\nOur conclusion is that veiling cannot be relied upon as a measure of accretion rates in CTTS with rich emission line spectra.", "Contrary to popular belief, giant low surface brightness (GLSB) galaxies may not be as massive and dark matter-dominated as previously thought. This misconception stems from unreliable rotation curves. Our new study focuses on two prototypical GLSB galaxies, Malin 1 and NGC 7589, and re-examines existing HI observations to derive new rotation curves. Surprisingly, these curves exhibit a steep rise in the central regions, similar to high surface brightness (HSB) systems. By decomposing the mass of these galaxies, we find that baryons may play a dominant role in the inner regions, with stellar mass-to-light ratios comparable to those of HSB galaxies. Our results, combined with recent studies, suggest that GLSB galaxies have a dual structure: a central HSB early-type spiral galaxy surrounded by an extended LSB disk. We also tested the MOND theory, which accurately predicts the rotation curve of NGC 7589 but struggles to explain Malin 1.", "The study examines the multiplicity distribution, moments, scaled variance, entropy, and reduced entropy of target evaporated fragments in various nucleus-emulsion interactions. The results show:\n\n* Gaussian distribution fits the multiplicity distribution in forward and backward hemispheres.\n* Multiplicity moments increase with order and are energy-independent for second-order moments.\n* Scaled variance is close to 1, indicating weak correlations among produced particles.\n* Entropy is similar in forward and backward hemispheres within experimental errors.", "We explore the theoretical behavior of a quantum dot over time when it's excited by off-resonant light pulses that quickly prepare the dot's states with the help of acoustic phonons. Our research reveals that three key processes occur when short laser pulses are used: the dot's states are initially 'dressed' as the pulse turns on, followed by relaxation caused by phonons, and finally an 'undressing' as the pulse ends. By examining different pulse shapes, we find that a gradual 'undressing' at the end of the pulse has a significant impact on the final state of the dot in short-pulse protocols. Additionally, we demonstrate that in systems with excitons and biexcitons, the characteristics of the laser pulse, such as its frequency offset and duration, as well as the biexciton binding energy, can be used to selectively target specific quantum dot states.", "In the standard quantum mechanics framework, the idea that measurements have probabilities was added later, mainly because of experimental results, rather than being a natural part of the mathematical model. However, an alternative approach called quantum logics provides a clear understanding of probability from the start. This approach includes the use of projection lattices in von Neumann algebras, where updating probabilities is equivalent to the measurement process described by Lueders and von Neumann. This leads to the definition of five levels of compatibility and measurability in quantum logics, which can be understood as: no quantum interference, having a joint probability distribution, being able to measure things at the same time, the final state not depending on the order of measurements, and two events belonging to the same logical group. While these levels are distinct in general, they coincide in the usual quantum mechanics framework, von Neumann algebras, and some other cases.", "Imagine a special kind of material that's made up of layers, each with its own unique properties. When light passes through this material, it behaves in a certain way depending on the direction it's traveling. We've taken a closer look at how this works in materials that have a special kind of symmetry, called elliptical birefringence.\n\nWhat we found is that the way light behaves in each layer affects how it behaves in the layers around it. This creates a kind of \"coupling\" between the layers, which changes the way light moves through the material. This coupling adds some extra complexity to the way light behaves, and it can even create gaps in the frequencies of light that can pass through the material.\n\nWe've studied the conditions under which these gaps form, and we've found that it depends on how the light is polarized in each layer. We've developed a simple way to measure this effect, and we've looked at how to make the gaps as big as possible. Our research helps us better understand how light interacts with these special materials, and it could have important implications for the development of new technologies.", "Imagine being able to supercharge your machine learning models by tapping into the power of random subspaces! That's exactly what we're exploring in this study, where we're pushing the boundaries of classical empirical risk minimization by introducing a game-changing twist: our hypothesis space is a random subspace of a given space. And the best part? This approach can lead to significant computational savings! But the million-dollar question is: does this shortcut come at the cost of accuracy? We're excited to report that our research shows it's possible to have your cake and eat it too - at least, in certain scenarios. Building on recent breakthroughs for least squares and self-concordant loss functions, we're breaking new ground by extending these results to convex Lipschitz loss functions, like the hinge loss used in support vector machines. Our innovative proofs and technical tools have led to some amazing discoveries, including the existence of 'sweet spots' where computational efficiency can be boosted without sacrificing performance. And to put it all into practice, we've included some simple yet illuminating numerical experiments to drive the point home. Get ready to take your machine learning to the next level!", "In the world of healthcare, patient consent is the golden key that unlocks access to medical data. Traditionally, this consent has been obtained through a tedious paper form that patients must fill out and sign. But with the rise of e-Health systems, we're revolutionizing the way consent is captured and managed. By integrating consent into the very fabric of medical data access, patients are empowered to take control of their personal information like never before. They can grant and revoke consent with ease, adapting to their unique situation and needs. However, this flexibility comes with a challenge: capturing the nuances of consent in a way that's both accurate and efficient. Our solution? ACTORS, a groundbreaking goal-driven approach that harnesses the power of Teleo-Reactive programming to manage consent in a dynamic, context-aware way. By focusing on the patient's goals and adapting to changing domains and contexts, ACTORS is poised to transform the way we approach consent in healthcare.", "This paper undertakes a mathematical examination of the inverse random source problem pertaining to the time-fractional diffusion equation, wherein the source is presumed to be driven by a fractional Brownian motion. In the context of the direct problem, the stochastic time-fractional diffusion equation is investigated, given a random source. Conversely, the inverse problem seeks to determine the statistical properties of the source based on the expectation and variance of the final time data. Our analysis demonstrates that the direct problem is well-posed and possesses a unique mild solution, subject to certain conditions. Furthermore, we establish the uniqueness of the inverse problem and characterize its instability. The primary components of our analysis are founded upon the properties of the Mittag-Leffler function and the stochastic integrals associated with the fractional Brownian motion.", "Manifold learning techniques play a vital role in uncovering the underlying structure of high-dimensional data sets that possess a low intrinsic dimensionality. Many of these methods rely on graph-based approaches, where each data point is represented as a vertex, and the relationships between them are captured by weighted edges. Existing theoretical frameworks have demonstrated that the Laplacian matrix of such graphs converges to the Laplace-Beltrami operator of the underlying data manifold, assuming that the pairwise affinities are calculated using the traditional Euclidean norm. This paper takes a significant step forward by deriving the limiting differential operator for graph Laplacians constructed using any norm, thereby expanding the scope of manifold learning. Our proof involves a fascinating interplay between the geometric properties of the manifold, as characterized by its second fundamental form, and the convex geometry of the unit ball associated with the chosen norm. To illustrate the potential advantages of non-Euclidean norms in manifold learning, we apply our approach to the challenging task of mapping the complex motion of large molecules with continuous variability. Through a numerical simulation, we demonstrate that a modified Laplacian eigenmaps algorithm, based on the Earthmover's distance, outperforms the classic Euclidean Laplacian eigenmaps in terms of both computational efficiency and the sample size required to accurately recover the intrinsic geometry of the data.", "We propose an efficient integral equation method for solving the heat equation in a 2D multiply connected domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on the heat kernel, our method involves discretizing time first, which leads to a non-homogeneous modified Helmholtz equation at each time step. The solution is expressed as a combination of volume and double layer potentials. We employ a fast multipole-accelerated solver to efficiently evaluate the volume potential. The boundary conditions are then enforced by solving an integral equation for the homogeneous modified Helmholtz equation, also accelerated by the fast multipole method. The computational cost per time step is linear, O(N) or O(N log N), for a total of N discretization points in the boundary and domain.", "We propose a scheme for determining the initial quantum state of qudits through sequential state-discrimination measurements. Since the qudits belong to a set of nonorthogonal quantum states, they cannot be distinguished with absolute certainty. However, unambiguous state discrimination allows for error-free measurements, albeit with the possibility of occasionally failing to provide a conclusive answer about the qudit's state. Notably, qudits have the potential to transmit more information per transmission than qubits. We explore a scenario in which Alice sends one of N qudits, each with a dimension of N. We examine two cases: one where all states have the same overlap, and another where the qudits are divided into two sets with different overlaps between qudits in different sets. Furthermore, we investigate the robustness of our scheme against a simple eavesdropping attack and find that using qudits instead of qubits increases the likelihood of an eavesdropper introducing errors and being detected.", "Imagine having super secure access control in Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. That's what we're going for here! We're making it happen by combining multiple IDs, attributes, and policies with the access control regulators. \n\nFirst, we took a close look at the current access control system used by Hyperledger Fabric. Then, we came up with a new and improved way to make access control decisions based on multiple IDs, attributes, and policies. It's way easier for users and developers to make these decisions now!\n\nOur new implementation makes it simple to add attributes and register new certificates (for new users) by wrapping the Fabric CA client. The best part? Our research shows that it's totally possible to combine multiple IDs, attributes, and policies using Hyperledger Fabric's smart contract tech. And the cherry on top? The performance impact is basically zero, especially when compared to just giving everyone access without any control!", "This research pioneers the development of pyramidal convolution (PyConv), a novel approach that enables the simultaneous processing of input data across multiple filter scales. By incorporating a hierarchical structure of kernels, each with distinct filter types, sizes, and depths, PyConv is capable of capturing a wide range of details within a scene. Notably, this enhanced recognition capability is achieved without incurring additional computational costs or parameter increases compared to traditional convolutional methods. Furthermore, PyConv's flexibility and extensibility provide a vast design space for tailoring network architectures to diverse applications. With its far-reaching potential to transform the computer vision landscape, we demonstrate PyConv's efficacy across four fundamental tasks: image classification, video action recognition, object detection, and semantic image segmentation. Our results show substantial performance gains compared to baseline models, including a 50-layer PyConv network that surpasses a 152-layer ResNet counterpart on the ImageNet dataset while requiring fewer parameters, lower computational complexity, and fewer layers. Additionally, our framework establishes a new benchmark for scene parsing on the ADE20K dataset. The PyConv code is publicly available at: https://github.com/iduta/pyconv.", "The CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) has made significant progress in the search for solar axions. In the first part of CAST phase II, we achieved a major milestone by scanning axion masses up to 0.4 eV using 4He gas at variable pressure. Our results set a new upper limit on the axion-photon coupling of g < 2.17 x 10^10 GeV$-1 at 95% CL for axion masses below 0.4 eV, depending on the pressure setting.\n\nCurrently, we are conducting a search for axions with masses up to 1.2 eV using 3He as a buffer gas in the second part of CAST phase II. We will present our expectations for the sensitivity of this search.\n\nLooking ahead, we will discuss near-future perspectives and long-term options for a new helioscope experiment, building on the success of CAST.", "Despite observations showing that Arctic sea ice is rapidly melting and Antarctic sea ice is expanding, climate models typically predict a moderate decrease in both. However, some models do show similar trends to the observations. Recent studies have suggested that these models are consistent with the observations when natural climate variability is considered. Our analysis of climate model simulations from 1979-2013 reveals that the models are not consistent with the observations. In the Arctic, the models that show rapid sea ice melting like we've observed also show too much global warming. In fact, the models would need to be run over 100 times to get the observed level of Arctic sea ice melting by chance. In the Antarctic, the models that show rapid sea ice expansion like we've observed also show too little global warming. This suggests that the models are getting the right answers for the wrong reasons in both the Arctic and Antarctic.", "Unlocking the Power of Biometrics in IoT Devices: Overcoming the Challenges\n\nAs the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to grow, biometric features are emerging as a crucial tool for authenticating devices. However, there are several obstacles hindering the large-scale development and deployment of biometrics models. This investigation delves into the factors limiting the use of human physiological features (such as face, eyes, fingerprints, and electrocardiogram) and behavioral characteristics (like signature, voice, gait, and keystroke) in IoT devices.\n\nWe explore the various machine learning and data mining methods employed in authentication and authorization schemes for mobile IoT devices, as well as the threat models and countermeasures used to safeguard biometrics-based authentication systems.\n\nOur research provides a comprehensive analysis of the current state of biometric-based authentication schemes for IoT devices, highlighting the challenges and opportunities for future research. By understanding the complexities and limitations of biometrics in IoT, we can unlock the full potential of this technology and create a more secure and connected world.", "Device identification through web-based fingerprinting has gained significant attention from both researchers and commercial entities. Currently, most fingerprinting methods rely on software-based features that can be easily altered by users, rendering them ineffective. This paper proposes a new approach that leverages the HTML5 standard to create fingerprinting features based on a device's hardware, which are much more difficult to modify or conceal. This approach offers a higher level of accuracy in identifying devices. We suggest several methods for HTML5 web applications to identify a device's hardware and present initial experimental results on fingerprinting a device's graphics processing unit (GPU).", "We derive the partition function of Chern-Simons theory on a three-sphere with exceptional gauge groups, which can be expressed in terms of the refined closed topological string partition function. This equivalence is established through the relation 2\u03c4 = gs(1-b), where \u03c4 is the single K\u00e4hler parameter, gs is the string coupling constant, and b is the refinement parameter, taking values of 5/3, 5/2, 3, 4, and 6 for the G2, F4, E6, E7, and E8 groups, respectively. The non-vanishing BPS invariants, denoted by NdJL,JR, are found to be N2(0,1/2) = 1 and N11(0,1) = 1. Additionally, the Chern-Simons partition function contains a term corresponding to refined constant maps in string theory. Our derivation relies on the universal form of the Chern-Simons partition function on a three-sphere, restricted to the exceptional line Exc, characterized by Vogel's parameters satisfying \u03b3 = 2(\u03b1+\u03b2). This line encompasses points corresponding to all exceptional groups. Notably, identical results are obtained for the F line, defined by \u03b3 = \u03b1+\u03b2, which includes the SU(4), SO(10), and E6 groups, with non-zero BPS invariants N2(0,1/2) = 1 and N7(0,1) = 1. In both cases, the refinement parameter b is expressed in terms of universal parameters, restricted to the line, as b = -\u03b2/\u03b1, which is equivalent to -\u03b52/\u03b51 in Nekrasov's parameterization.", "The centerpoint theorem is a fundamental concept in discrete geometry, stating that for any set of n points in d-dimensional space, there exists a point c (not necessarily part of the original set) such that every half-space containing c includes at least n/(d+1) points from the original set. This point c is called a centerpoint, which can be seen as a higher-dimensional equivalent of a median. However, what if we want to have multiple representatives instead of just one? In one-dimensional data, it's common to use quantiles as representatives. We propose an extension of this concept to higher dimensions. Our idea is to find a small set Q of points such that every half-space containing at least one point from Q includes a significant proportion of the original points, and every half-space containing more points from Q includes an even larger proportion. This concept is related to weak \u03b5-nets and weak \u03b5-approximations, but is stronger than the former and weaker than the latter.", "We have developed a new software package called PsrPopPy for simulating pulsar populations. It's based on the Psrpop package, but we've rewritten the code in Python to make it more modular and flexible. We've also kept some external libraries in their original Fortran code. The software comes with pre-written scripts for standard simulations, but you can also write your own custom scripts. The modular design makes it easy to add new features, such as different models for period or luminosity distributions.\n\nWe're also exploring ways to expand the software's capabilities. To demonstrate its potential, we've used PsrPopPy to analyze survey results and found that pulsar spectral indices follow a normal distribution with a mean of -1.4 and a standard deviation of 1.0. We've also used the software to model pulsar spin evolution and calculate the relationship between luminosity and spin parameters. Our results show that the underlying population is best described by a power-law dependence of radio luminosity on period and period derivative. Specifically, we found that L \u221d P^(-1.39 \u00b1 0.09) \u1e56^(0.48 \u00b1 0.04), which is similar to the relationship found for \u03b3-ray pulsars. Using this relationship, we've generated a model population and examined the age-luminosity relation for all pulsars, which could be measurable with future large-scale surveys using the Square Kilometer Array.", "We investigate the dynamics of a spin ensemble strongly coupled to a resonator driven by external pulses. When the spin ensemble's mean frequency resonates with the cavity mode, we observe damped Rabi oscillations, accurately described by our model, including the dephasing effect of inhomogeneous spin broadening. We show that precise knowledge of this broadening is crucial for understanding spin-cavity dynamics. By driving the system with pulses that match specific resonance conditions, we can enhance coherent oscillations between the spin ensemble and cavity by several orders of magnitude. Our theoretical approach is validated by an experiment using negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond coupled to a superconducting waveguide resonator.", "We explore the properties of an inhomogeneous quantum Ising spin-1/2 chain in a transverse field, focusing on its ground-state Riemannian metric and cyclic quantum distance. To analyze this model, we employ a general canonical transformation to convert the spin system into a fermionic Hamiltonian, which can be diagonalized. By applying a gauge transformation to the spin Hamiltonian using a twist operator, we introduce a parameter manifold ring, denoted by S^1, and derive the ground-state Riemannian metric exactly. We then investigate the ground-state cyclic quantum distance and the second derivative of the ground-state energy across different regions of inhomogeneous exchange coupling parameters. Notably, our results show that the quantum ferromagnetic phase in the uniform Ising chain is characterized by a constant ground-state Riemannian metric and an invariant cyclic quantum distance, whereas in the paramagnetic phase, the metric rapidly decays to zero.", "Rotation measure synthesis, a technique that leverages Fourier transforms to estimate Faraday dispersion, has emerged as a primary tool for probing cosmic magnetic fields. Interestingly, we have found that this method can be mathematically equated to the one-dimensional interferometric intensity measurement equation, albeit in a distinct Fourier space. This equivalence enables the adaptation of familiar concepts from two-dimensional intensity interferometry, designed to accommodate various instrumental conditions, to the analysis of Faraday dispersion. Notably, we demonstrate how to model the impact of channel averaging during Faraday reconstruction, a limitation that has hindered progress in polarimetric science using wide-band measurements. Through simulations of one-dimensional sparse reconstruction with channel averaging, we show that it is possible to recover signals with large rotation measure values that were previously undetectable. This breakthrough is particularly significant for low-frequency and wide-band polarimetry. Furthermore, we extend these concepts to incorporate mosaicking in Faraday depth into the channel averaging process. This work provides the first comprehensive framework for undertaking wide-band rotation measure synthesis, including the capability to combine data from multiple telescopes, which is expected to substantially enhance the quality and quantity of polarimetric science. The significance of this development lies in its potential to accurately probe extreme environments characterized by high magnetic fields, such as those associated with pulsars and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), and to utilize these sources as probes of cosmological fields.", "This study investigates the characteristic properties of charged particle production in high-energy hadron-nucleus collisions using a range of statistical models. We compare the predictive power of four different approaches: the Negative Binomial distribution, the shifted Gompertz distribution, the Weibull distribution, and the Krasznovszky-Wagner distribution. These distributions, derived from various functional forms, are based on either phenomenological parameterizations or models of the underlying dynamics. Notably, some of these distributions have also been applied to Large Hadron Collider (LHC) data for both proton-proton and nucleus-nucleus collisions. Our analysis employs a variety of physical and derived observables to assess the relative success of each model.", "In 1975, John Tukey introduced the concept of a multivariate median, defined as the point with the highest \"depth\" within a given data cloud in R^d. Later, David Donoho and Miriam Gasko developed a method to measure the depth of an arbitrary point z with respect to the data by identifying the smallest proportion of data points separated by hyperplanes passing through z. This concept has since proven to be highly fruitful, leading to the development of a rich statistical methodology based on data depth and nonparametric depth statistics. Various notions of data depth have been introduced, differing in their computability, robustness, and sensitivity to asymmetric data shapes. Each notion is suited to specific applications due to its distinct properties. The upper level sets of a depth statistic form a family of set-valued statistics, known as depth-trimmed or central regions, which describe the distribution's location, scale, and shape. The most central region serves as a median. The concept of depth has been generalized from empirical distributions (data clouds) to general probability distributions on R^d, enabling the derivation of laws of large numbers and consistency results. Furthermore, it has been extended to functional spaces, accommodating data with more complex structures.", "Designing optoelectronic devices at the nanoscale requires strain-engineering in SiGe nanostructures. We've developed a new approach to achieve high tensile strain without external stressors, making it more scalable. By laterally confining SiGe structures with a Si substrate, we've created Ge-rich SiGe nano-stripes with a large tensile hydrostatic strain component. This strain is highest at the center of the top surface and decreases towards the edges.\n\nUsing advanced techniques like tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, finite element method simulations, and ab initio calculations, we've measured the strain state of these nano-stripes with unprecedented resolution (~30 nm). Our results show that the lattice deformation is greater than in thermally relaxed Ge/Si(001) layers, due to the combination of lateral confinement and plastic relaxation at the SiGe/Si interface.\n\nWe've also probed the effect of this tensile lattice deformation on the stripe surface using X-ray photoelectron emission microscopy, achieving a spatial resolution better than 100 nm. Our findings show a positive work function shift compared to bulk SiGe alloys, which is supported by electronic structure calculations. These results have significant implications for designing optoelectronic devices at the nanoscale.", "In the midst of a pandemic, the ability to share electronic medical records and models across regions is crucial. However, applying data or models from one region to another can be a recipe for disaster, as it often leads to distribution shift issues that defy traditional machine learning assumptions. That's where transfer learning comes in - a powerful solution to bridge the gap.\n\nTo unlock the full potential of deep transfer learning algorithms, we put two data-based approaches (domain adversarial neural networks and maximum classifier discrepancy) and model-based transfer learning algorithms to the test in infectious disease detection tasks. We also delved into well-defined synthetic scenarios where the data distribution differences between two regions were crystal clear.\n\nOur experiments yielded exciting results: transfer learning can be a game-changer in infectious disease classification when (1) the source and target regions share similarities, but the target region lacks sufficient training data, and (2) the target region's training data is unlabeled. In the first scenario, model-based transfer learning shines, with performance rivaling that of data-based transfer learning models. However, there's still more work to be done to tackle the domain shift in real-world research data and address the performance drop.", "Over the past decade, the phenomenon of bound states in the continuum (BIC) has garnered significant attention in the realms of optics and photonics, sparking a flurry of research endeavors. In particular, the investigation of quasi-BICs in simplistic structures has proven to be a fascinating area of study, as these structures often exhibit pronounced quasi-BIC characteristics. A paradigmatic example of such a structure is the dielectric cylinder, which has been extensively explored in various studies, both in isolation and in combination with other cylinders. This present work delves into the properties of quasi-BICs during a gradual transformation from a homogeneous dielectric cylinder situated in an air environment to a ring with narrow walls, achieved by incrementally increasing the diameter of the inner air cylinder. The findings of this study reveal a remarkable crossover of quasi-BICs from the strong-coupling to the weak-coupling regime, manifesting as a transition from the avoided crossing of branches to their intersection, with the quasi-BIC persisting solely on one linear branch. Notably, in the strong-coupling regime, three waves interact in the far-field zone: two waves corresponding to the resonant modes of the structure and the wave scattered by the structure as a whole. This observation prompts a critical examination of the Fano resonance concept, which is typically employed to describe the interference of only two waves under weak coupling conditions, thereby raising questions about its validity in this context.", "Turbulent thermal diffusion is a complex phenomenon that arises from the interplay between temperature-stratified turbulence and the inertia of small particles. This process gives rise to a non-diffusive turbulent flux of particles that aligns with the direction of the turbulent heat flux. The magnitude of this flux is directly proportional to the product of the mean particle number density and the effective velocity of inertial particles.\n\nPrevious research has only explored this effect under limited conditions, specifically for small temperature gradients and Stokes numbers (Phys. Rev. Lett. **76**, 224, 1996). In this study, we have developed a generalized theory of turbulent thermal diffusion that can accommodate arbitrary temperature gradients and Stokes numbers.\n\nTo validate our theory, we conducted laboratory experiments in oscillating grid turbulence and multi-fan produced turbulence, which simulated strongly stratified turbulent flows. Our results show that the ratio of the effective velocity of inertial particles to the characteristic vertical turbulent velocity decreases to less than 1 at large Reynolds numbers.\n\nFurthermore, we found that the effective velocity of inertial particles and the effective coefficient of turbulent thermal diffusion increase with Stokes numbers, peaking at small Stokes numbers and decreasing for larger values. Additionally, the effective coefficient of turbulent thermal diffusion decreases with increasing mean temperature gradients.\n\nOur developed theory has been successfully validated through comparison with the results of our laboratory experiments, demonstrating its accuracy and reliability.", "Unlocking the Secrets of Pulsar Radio Emission: A New Perspective\n\nFor decades, the rotating vector model (RVM) has been the standard approach to understanding pulsar radio emission. However, this model relies on a simplifying assumption that the emission is confined to a narrow cone around the tangent to a dipolar field line. But what if we could do better?\n\nA more exact treatment, known as the tangent model, reveals that the visible point of emission changes as the pulsar rotates, tracing a trajectory on a sphere of radius r. By solving for this trajectory and the angular velocity of the visible point, we uncover a more nuanced understanding of pulsar emission.\n\nRecent research has even suggested that this motion could be observable using interstellar holography. But how accurate is the RVM in capturing this phenomenon? Our analysis reveals that the RVM introduces significant errors, particularly for pulsars with emission spanning a wide range of rotational phases. In fact, the RVM tends to underestimate the range of phases over which emission is visible.\n\nOur findings have important implications for the geometry of pulsar emission. They suggest that the visible radio emission is likely to originate from heights exceeding 10% of the light-cylinder distance, where retardation effects become significant. This challenges our current understanding and opens up new avenues for research into the mysteries of pulsar radio emission.", "In image recognition, it is not uncommon for training samples to be incomplete, failing to represent all target classes. Zero-shot learning (ZSL) addresses this limitation by leveraging class semantic information to classify samples from unseen categories that are absent from the training set. This paper presents an end-to-end framework, dubbed the Global Semantic Consistency Network (GSC-Net), which harnesses the semantic information of both seen and unseen classes to facilitate effective zero-shot learning. Furthermore, we incorporate a soft label embedding loss to capitalize on the semantic relationships between classes. To extend GSC-Net to the more realistic setting of Generalized Zero-shot Learning (GZSL), we introduce a parametric novelty detection mechanism. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both ZSL and GZSL tasks across three visual attribute datasets, thereby validating the efficacy and advantages of the proposed framework.", "You might think that Category theory is all about supporting Mathematical Structuralism, but that's actually a misconception. The truth is, Category theory needs a different philosophical approach to math altogether. While structural math focuses on unchanging patterns, categorical math looks at how things change and transform - and often, there's no fixed pattern to be found. In this paper, I'll explore a new way of understanding categorical math that breaks free from structuralism, and show how it can change the way we think about the history of math and how we teach it.", "In a dynamic, out-of-balance system of exciton-polariton condensates, where polaritons are created through incoherent energy injection, we demonstrate the ability to generate stable, ring-shaped vortex memory elements with a topological charge of either +1 or -1. By utilizing simple, carefully designed potential guides, we can selectively replicate the same topological charge or invert it onto a separate, spatially distinct ring pump. This innovative manipulation of binary information unlocks the potential for a novel type of processing, where vortices serve as robust, topologically protected memory components, paving the way for groundbreaking advancements in data storage and manipulation.", "Over the course of three years, our team put the LOFT mission's satellite instrumentation to the test, simulating the harsh conditions of space to gauge its resilience. As part of the ESA's Cosmic Vision program, we subjected the silicon drift detectors to intense proton radiation, with energies of 0.8 and 11 MeV, to observe how it affected their performance. We also blasted them with high-speed dust particles to see how they'd hold up to debris impacts. In this paper, we'll dive into the details of our experiments and explore what our findings mean for the LOFT mission's success.", "This paper explores the effectiveness of low-level multimodal features in extracting movie similarities within a content-based movie recommendation framework. We present a multimodal representation model that combines textual information from subtitles, audio cues, and visual features to capture movie characteristics. In the textual domain, we employ topic modeling to extract discriminative topics from movie subtitles. For the visual domain, we focus on extracting semantically meaningful features related to camera movements, colors, and faces. In the audio domain, we utilize simple classification aggregates based on pre-trained models. We integrate these features with static metadata (e.g., directors, actors) to demonstrate the enhancement of content-based movie similarity estimation using low-level multimodal information. To validate our approach, we constructed a dataset of 160 well-known movies and evaluated movie similarities through recommendation rankings. Our extensive experiments show that incorporating low-level features from all three modalities (text, audio, and visual) improves the performance of a content-based recommendation system by over 50% relative increase compared to traditional metadata-based approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to leverage a comprehensive range of features from all involved modalities to enhance content similarity estimation, surpassing metadata-based methods.", "Delving into the mysteries of black hole radiation, we explore the quantum gravity of a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole, electrified with a powerful charge. By applying a canonical quantization approach to a spherically symmetric geometry, we uncover the secrets of the Wheeler-De Witt equation, solving it in two crucial regions: between the outer apparent horizon and infinity, and between the spacetime singularity and the inner apparent horizon. Our findings reveal that the mass loss rate of an evaporating black hole, fueled by thermal radiation, aligns perfectly with semiclassical results - but only when we carefully select an integration constant guided by physical intuition. Moreover, we successfully solve the Wheeler-De Witt equation in the region between the inner Cauchy horizon and the outer apparent horizon, yielding the same mass loss rate expression. This groundbreaking study builds upon the foundation of Schwarzschild black holes, taking a significant leap forward by generalizing the concept to charged Reissner-Nordstrom black holes.", "We introduce Multi-Agent A* (MAA*), a complete and optimal algorithm for solving decentralized partially-observable Markov decision problems (DEC-POMDPs) with a finite time limit. MAA* is ideal for planning optimal actions for a team of cooperative agents operating in uncertain environments, such as multi-robot coordination, network traffic control, or distributed resource allocation. Our approach combines classical heuristic search and decentralized control theory to effectively solve these complex problems. Experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages of MAA*. We also present an anytime variant of MAA* and discuss potential extensions, including a method for solving problems with no time limit.", "We applied machine learning to classify objects in SDSS DR6, building on the Galaxy Zoo categorizations of early types, spirals, and point sources/artifacts. By training an artificial neural network on a subset of human-classified objects, we tested its ability to replicate human classifications for the remaining sample. Our results show that the neural network's success hinges on the input parameters chosen. While colors and profile-fitting parameters can separate objects into three classes, adding adaptive shape parameters, concentration, and texture significantly improves the results. However, adaptive moments, concentration, and texture alone cannot distinguish between early type galaxies and point sources/artifacts. Using a 12-parameter set, the neural network achieves over 90% accuracy in reproducing human classifications for all three morphological classes. Notably, our results remain robust even when using an incomplete magnitude training set. Our findings suggest that machine learning algorithms hold promise for morphological classification in future wide-field imaging surveys, with the Galaxy Zoo catalogue serving as a valuable training resource.", "The Lambek calculus, a prominent logical framework for capturing the intricacies of natural language syntax, has undergone significant expansions to tackle more nuanced linguistic complexities. Initially, the calculus was limited to context-free settings, but subsequent extensions have broadened its scope. Notably, Morrill and Valentin's 2015 extension incorporates exponential and bracket modalities, relying on a non-standard contraction rule that intricately interacts with bracket structures. This novel approach diverges from the traditional contraction rule. This paper presents a proof of the undecidability of the derivability problem within their extended calculus. Furthermore, we examine the restricted, decidable fragments identified by Morrill and Valentin, demonstrating their membership in the NP complexity class.", "For decades, the transition between the two phases of 4D Euclidean Dynamical Triangulation was thought to be a second-order phenomenon, but a groundbreaking discovery in 1996 revealed that it's actually a first-order transition - as long as the system is large enough [5,9]! However, some lingering questions remained: did the numerical methods used influence the outcome? We're excited to report that we've tackled these concerns head-on! By allowing the volume to fluctuate freely, taking measurements after a fixed number of attempted moves, and harnessing the power of an optimized parallel tempering algorithm [12], we've overcome the limitations of previous studies. And the result? A resounding confirmation that the phase transition is indeed first order, even in systems as large as 64k 4-simplices! But that's not all - we've also developed a local criterion to identify whether parts of a triangulation are in the elongated or crumpled state, and uncovered a fascinating connection between EDT and the balls in boxes model. This has led to a modified partition function with an additional, third coupling, opening up new avenues for exploration. And, we're thrilled to propose a class of modified path-integral measures that could potentially eliminate the metastability of the Markov chain, transforming the phase transition into a second-order phenomenon. The possibilities are endless, and we can't wait to see where this research takes us!", "We've identified the types of groups for which the Domino Problem can be solved. These groups are either virtually free (which means they are similar to finite groups) or have a subgroup that is similar to the integers (specifically, the group of integers with a finite number of elements).", "Detecting dark matter indirectly through gamma rays produced by its annihilation in the Galactic halo is a promising approach. We show that distinctive spectral patterns near the dark matter particles' mass, a common prediction in most models, can greatly enhance the ability of gamma-ray telescopes to detect dark matter signals. Our analysis provides projected limits on these features, including the traditionally sought-after line signals, and demonstrates that they can be more effective in understanding dark matter's nature than the broader spectral features expected at lower energies.", "Achieving carbon neutrality demands a comprehensive research agenda that tackles the technical and economic hurdles that come with transitioning to 100% renewable electricity. As the share of variable renewable energy sources like wind and solar power grows, maintaining a balance between supply and demand in the grid becomes increasingly complex. The performance and impact of inverters used in these systems also need to be addressed. This study explores the implications of shifting to carbon neutrality and identifies key research challenges in areas such as system planning, operation, and stability, as well as the integration of energy storage, demand-side participation, distributed control, and energy sector coupling. We highlight existing knowledge gaps and present our recent findings that can help fill these gaps, ultimately improving grid operation and estimation. Our comparative case studies provide numerical results on the operational stability and economics of power grids with high levels of renewable energy, helping stakeholders develop targeted roadmaps and make informed decisions.", "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used in computer vision, but their large size requires significant storage and memory. We introduce Frequency-Sensitive Hashed Nets (FreshNets), a novel architecture that reduces memory and storage needs by exploiting redundancy in CNNs. By converting filter weights to the frequency domain and grouping similar frequencies using a hash function, we can share parameter values and reduce model size. Our approach, evaluated on eight datasets, outperforms several baselines in compressed performance.", "We designed a learning exercise that combined Project-Based Learning with Japanese manga techniques to improve Requirements Development processes. We applied manga's established methods, such as character development and storytelling, to RD. By using this innovative approach, students were able to clearly define project objectives early on and successfully developed high-quality, unique system ideas.", "Defying the conventional wisdom of the standard Hawking formula, which forecasts the complete evaporation of black holes, we delve into the uncharted territory of quantum gravity. Our investigation reveals a fascinating phenomenon: fermions tunneling out of a 5-dimensional rotating black string. But here's the twist - the temperature of this process is not solely dictated by the string itself, but is also influenced by the quantum number of the escaping fermion and the presence of an extra spatial dimension. This quantum correction throws a wrench into the works, slowing down the temperature's ascent and ultimately giving rise to a remnant that persists even after evaporation.", "This study presents a novel approach to word representation, leveraging second-order vector embeddings derived from topological features of nearest neighbors in pre-trained contextual word embeddings. We investigate the efficacy of these second-order embeddings as input features in three distinct natural language processing models: a deep model for named entity recognition, a deep model for recognizing textual entailment, and a linear model for paraphrase recognition. Our findings indicate that nearest neighbor information alone is sufficient to capture a significant proportion of the performance benefits afforded by pre-trained word embeddings. Furthermore, second-order embeddings demonstrate improved robustness in handling heterogeneous data, albeit at the cost of some specificity. Additionally, augmenting contextual embeddings with second-order information yields further performance enhancements in certain cases. We also observe that incorporating nearest neighbor features from multiple first-order embedding samples, which are subject to variance due to random initialization, can contribute to downstream performance gains. Finally, our analysis reveals intriguing characteristics of second-order embedding spaces that warrant further investigation, including increased density and distinct semantic interpretations of cosine similarity.", "Unlocking the Full Potential of RIS-Aided Millimeter Wave Wireless Systems: Enhanced Localization Capabilities Revealed\n\nImagine a wireless system that not only provides robustness to blockage and enhanced coverage but also offers pinpoint localization accuracy. In this groundbreaking paper, we explore the untapped potential of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) to revolutionize wireless localization.\n\nBy harnessing the power of sparse reconstruction algorithms, we can extract high-resolution channel estimates and translate them into precise position information. However, the complexity of sparse recovery in RIS-aided mmWave systems poses a significant challenge, given the massive number of RIS elements and communication arrays.\n\nTo overcome this hurdle, we introduce a novel multidimensional orthogonal matching pursuit strategy for compressive channel estimation. This innovative approach involves computing projections on multiple independent dictionaries, rather than a single large dictionary, to achieve high-accuracy channel estimation at reduced complexity.\n\nBut that's not all. We also combine this strategy with a cutting-edge localization method that doesn't rely on the absolute time of arrival of the Line of Sight (LoS) path. The results are astounding: in a realistic 3D indoor scenario, our RIS-aided wireless system demonstrates a significant improvement in localization accuracy.\n\nDiscover how RIS-aided millimeter wave wireless systems can unlock new possibilities in wireless localization and transform the future of communication.", "Imagine being able to safeguard confidentiality like never before! Detecting and quantifying information leaks through timing side channels is crucial, and we've got a game-changing solution. While static analysis has been the go-to approach, it's often too computationally demanding for real-world applications and only provides a simple 'yes' or 'no' answer. But what if you need to leak information about a secret in a controlled way? That's where our innovative dynamic analysis method comes in!\n\nWe've broken down the problem into two manageable tasks. First, we create a timing model of the program using a neural network - and it's incredibly effective! Then, we analyze the neural network to quantify information leaks with precision. Our experiments have shown that both tasks are not only possible but also highly practical, outperforming existing side channel detectors and quantifiers.\n\nOur groundbreaking contributions include a custom neural network architecture that uncovers side channels with ease and an MILP-based algorithm that estimates side-channel strength with accuracy. We've tested our approach on a range of micro-benchmarks and real-world applications, and the results are astounding. Our neural network models can learn the timing behaviors of programs with thousands of methods, and we can efficiently analyze neural networks with thousands of neurons to detect and quantify information leaks through timing side channels. Get ready to revolutionize confidentiality protection!", "The inner asteroid belt between 2.1 and 2.5 au is a crucial region, supplying most chondritic meteorites and near-Earth asteroids. Bounded by a secular resonance and the 1:3 mean motion resonance with Jupiter, asteroids can only escape through large eccentricity changes or scattering by Mars. However, Yarkovsky forces are ineffective for asteroids over 30 km in diameter. This study examines chaotic diffusion near the 1:2 mean motion resonance with Mars, revealing that while it increases inclination and eccentricity dispersion, it doesn't alter their mean values. Surprisingly, the resonance mitigates asteroid scattering by Mars at high eccentricities, prolonging their lifetime in the belt. Our findings suggest that gravitational forces alone cannot explain the observed eccentricity changes, and resonant trapping plays a key role in shielding asteroids from Mars encounters.", "The discovery of nonstandard neutrino interactions (NSI) could significantly impact the precision of next-generation neutrino oscillation experiments. To better understand and constrain the NSI parameter space, additional types of experiments are necessary. In this study, we investigate the constraints on NSI with electrons using current and future $e^+e^-$ collider experiments, including Belle II, STCF, and CEPC. Our findings indicate that Belle II and STCF will provide competitive and complementary bounds on electron-type NSI parameters, rivaling the current global analysis, and will significantly improve constraints on tau-type NSI. Furthermore, CEPC alone will impose stringent constraints on the NSI parameter space with electrons. Notably, by combining data from three different running modes, we can lift the degeneracy between left-handed (vector) and right-handed (axial-vector) NSI parameters, allowing us to constrain the allowed ranges for $|\\epsilon_{ee}^{eL}|$ ($|\\epsilon_{ee}^{eV}|$) and $|\\epsilon_{ee}^{eR}|$ ($|\\epsilon_{ee}^{eA}|$) to be smaller than 0.002 at CEPC, even if both are present.", "The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a cutting-edge project that aims to study neutrinos and search for proton decay. The experiment will use four large tanks filled with liquid argon, which will detect particles and measure their properties. To make sure the design is optimal, two prototype detectors are being tested at CERN. Before that, a smaller version of the detector was built and tested in 2017, and it worked well.\n\nAn important part of the detector is the light detection system, which helps trigger the collection of data and provides additional information about the particles being detected. In the smaller detector, five special light sensors were installed to test different configurations. During the test, data was collected on the light produced when particles interacted with the liquid argon.\n\nThe results of the test showed how well the light detection system worked and provided new insights into the properties of liquid argon. Our studies helped improve our understanding of this material.", "In a breakthrough move, top chip manufacturers have unleashed the power of Multithreaded processors, capable of handling a diverse range of workloads. However, to unlock their full potential, efficient resource utilization is crucial. One key to unlocking this potential lies in harnessing memory-level parallelism (MLP). This paper proposes a revolutionary MLP-aware operating system (OS) scheduling algorithm, specifically designed for Multithreaded Multi-core processors. By dynamically monitoring MLP availability in each thread and balancing it with system resources, the OS can generate a optimized thread schedule for the next quantum, leading to a significant boost in overall performance. We present a comprehensive qualitative comparison of our solution with existing hardware and software techniques, paving the way for further innovation. The possibilities are endless - future research directions include quantitative evaluation and refinement of the scheduling optimization, promising to take performance to new heights.", "Unlock the Power of Compressed Sensing: A Breakthrough in Blind Calibration\n\nImagine a world where compressed sensing measurement systems can be calibrated with ease, even when faced with unknown gains on each measurement. Our innovative approach makes this a reality, using a few unknown but sparse signals to achieve blind calibration.\n\nYou might expect this problem to be fraught with complexity, similar to blind source separation and dictionary learning, which are notorious for their non-convexity and local minima. But, surprisingly, we've discovered that this challenge can be transformed into a convex optimization problem, solvable with standard algorithms.\n\nOur numerical simulations demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of this approach, even when dealing with highly uncalibrated measurements. The key? Providing a sufficient number of unknown, sparse calibrating signals. What's more, we've observed that the success or failure of this method is governed by sharp phase transitions, offering valuable insights into the underlying dynamics.\n\nGet ready to unlock the full potential of compressed sensing with our groundbreaking blind calibration technique.", "We tackle multi-source morphological reinflection, a generalization of the standard single-source task. The input includes a target tag and multiple source form-tag pairs for a lemma. This approach leverages complementary information from different source forms, such as stems. We propose a novel encoder-decoder architecture with multiple encoders, outperforming single-source models. Our dataset is publicly available to facilitate future research.", "**Timely Knowledge Extraction from Semantically Annotated Data Streams**\n\nThe increasing demand for extracting non-trivial knowledge from data streams, particularly on the Web and in the Internet of Things (IoT), requires efficient and expressive reasoning. However, computing expressive reasoning on large streams is a significant challenge.\n\n**Introducing Laser: A Novel Reasoner for Stream Reasoning**\n\nWe propose Laser, a new reasoner that supports a pragmatic fragment of the logic LARS, which extends Answer Set Programming (ASP) for streams. Laser's core innovation is a novel evaluation procedure that annotates formulae to avoid duplicate re-computation at multiple time points.\n\n**Significant Performance Improvement**\n\nLaser's procedure, combined with a judicious implementation of LARS operators, achieves significantly better runtimes than state-of-the-art systems like C-SPARQL, CQELS, and Clingo-based LARS implementations. This breakthrough enables the application of expressive logic-based reasoning to large streams, opening up new possibilities for stream reasoning use cases.", "The second law of thermodynamics sets boundaries on how much energy and info can be swapped between physical systems. We're building on a framework that already exists for two systems, and expanding it to work with multiple systems. We've found a key measure that describes how info is shared between them. We've also come up with an improved version of this measure. To make it more concrete, we've tested our ideas using a model featuring two rival 'Maxwell demons'.", "Unlocking the Secrets of Graphene's Hidden Spin: How Defects in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides Can Revolutionize Proximity-Induced Spin-Orbit Coupling!\n\nImagine being able to harness the power of graphene's intrinsic spin-orbit coupling, a phenomenon once thought to be negligible. By stacking graphene with transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), we can unlock this hidden potential. But what if we could take it a step further? What if we could deliberately introduce defects into the TMDC layer to amplify the spin-orbit coupling in graphene?\n\nIn this groundbreaking study, we explore the untapped potential of alloyed ${\\rm G/W_{\\chi}Mo_{1-\\chi}Se_2}$ heterostructures, where the composition of the TMDC layer holds the key to unlocking the strength and nature of the induced spin-orbit coupling. Using cutting-edge density functional theory simulations, we delve into the world of defect distributions and diverse compositions ($\\chi$).\n\nOur findings are nothing short of remarkable. Despite the dramatic impact of individual defects on local parameters, the low-energy spin and electronic behavior can be accurately predicted using a simple effective medium model. This model relies solely on the composition ratio of the metallic species in the TMDC layer.\n\nBut that's not all. We also demonstrate that the topological state of these alloyed systems can be precisely tuned by controlling this ratio. The implications are profound: we can now harness the power of proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling to create novel, tunable topological materials.\n\nJoin us on this journey into the uncharted territory of graphene-TMDC heterostructures, where the boundaries of spin-orbit coupling are being rewritten.", "Atomic masses are very important in nuclear astrophysics calculations. Because we don't have exact values for some unusual atoms, scientists have been working hard to develop new tools to measure them. There are two main ways to measure atomic masses: the Time-of-Flight (TOF) method and the Penning trap method. The TOF method is useful when the Penning trap method can't be used. The NSCL facility is a great place to use the TOF method to measure the masses of very unusual atoms. Recently, we used a special technique called TOF-Brho at the NSCL facility to measure the masses of some atoms that are important for understanding how stars work and how neutron stars are formed.", "A long-standing mystery has shrouded the realm of black holes: why do super-massive active galactic nuclei (AGN) and stellar mass X-ray binaries (XRBs) share so many properties, yet broad emission lines (BELs) are exclusive to AGN? The detection of these lines in SDSS databases has led to a puzzling conclusion: not a single AGN with a mass below 10^5 M_sun has been found. But is this because they genuinely don't exist, or are they simply flying under the radar due to inefficient BEL production?\n\nIn this groundbreaking study, we set out to uncover the truth. By simulating the ionizing spectral energy distribution for a vast range of black hole masses - from 10 to 10^9 M_sun, spanning the entire spectrum from XRBs to AGN - we calculated the equivalent widths (EWs) of key ultraviolet and optical lines, including Ly\u03b1, H\u03b2, CIV, and MgII. Our calculations leveraged the powerful LOC (locally optimally emitting cloud) model to describe the BELR.\n\nOur findings are nothing short of astonishing. Contrary to expectations, the hardening of the SED shape with decreasing mass does not diminish BEL EWs. Instead, it's the finite size of the BELR - controlled by the black hole's mass - that regulates the production of these emission lines. We discovered a striking peak in EWs for typical AGN black holes around 10^8 M_sun, below which the lines become increasingly faint, with a precipitous drop-off below 10^6 M_sun. This could be the underlying reason for the absence of low-mass AGN in SDSS databases.", "Get ready for a breakthrough in synchronization technology! For the first time ever, we're putting pulse-coupled oscillator-based algorithms to the test on FPGA-based radios - and the results are astounding! Our measurements reveal that these algorithms can achieve precision in the low microsecond range when implemented in the physical layer. But that's not all - we're taking it to the next level with an innovative algorithm extension that compensates for phase rate deviations in the hardware. The outcome? A precision of under one microsecond is now possible! This game-changing technology has the potential to revolutionize ad hoc wireless systems, enabling fully distributed synchronization of transmission slots and sleep cycles - even in scenarios where centralized synchronization is impossible. The future of wireless communication just got a whole lot brighter!", "Human Trajectory Prediction (HTP) has been getting a lot of attention lately, and tons of solutions have been thrown into the mix. But here's the thing: we need a way to compare these methods fairly. That's where this paper comes in - we're tackling the question of how to measure just how tricky a dataset is when it comes to predicting human movement. To do that, we've come up with a set of indicators that focus on three key ideas: how predictable are the trajectories, how regular are they, and how complex is the context. We've put the most popular HTP datasets to the test using these indicators, and we're discussing what this means for benchmarking HTP algorithms. Oh, and we've made our code available on Github, so feel free to check it out!", "This paper demonstrates how classical linear stochastic systems can be implemented using quantum optical components, which offer faster response and processing times due to their higher bandwidth. A procedure is provided for constructing the quantum optical realization, and its application in a measurement feedback loop is described, with examples illustrating the main results.", "Systems biology relies on complex networks of biochemical reactions to understand how biological cells function at the molecular and cellular levels. In these networks, reactions occur at different rates, with some happening much faster than others. By focusing on the fastest reactions first, we can break down the system's behavior into a series of equilibrium states, where different groups of variables reach a balance. In particular, when two opposing reactions have similar strengths and overshadow the others, the system reaches equilibrium. This process can be mathematically described using tropical analysis, allowing us to simplify complex models and better understand the underlying dynamics.", "We analyzed the Suzaku data of the galactic disk and outflow regions of the starburst galaxy M82 using spectral analysis. Our thermal modeling of the central disk regions revealed that at least three temperature components are required to accurately describe the data. Notably, the Ly\u03b2 line fluxes of O VIII and Ne X exceeded the expected values for a plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium. The ratios of Ly\u03b2 to Ly\u03b1 lines for O VIII and Ne X were also higher than expected, suggesting that charge exchange may be occurring.\n\nIn contrast, the spectra of the outflow wind region were well-reproduced using two-temperature thermal models. From these models, we derived the metal abundances of O, Ne, Mg, and Fe in the outflow. The abundance ratios of O/Fe, Ne/Fe, and Mg/Fe were approximately 2, 3, and 2, respectively, relative to the solar values reported by Lodders (2003). Since there was no evidence of charge exchange in the outflow region, these metal abundances are likely more reliable than those in the central region. This abundance pattern suggests that starburst activity enriches the outflow by ejecting metals into intergalactic space through supernovae type II explosions.", "Unveiling the Cosmic Dust Makers: A Supernova Surprise\n\nFor centuries, scientists believed that dust grains were born in the gentle winds of aging stars. But a new wave of evidence suggests that supernovae, those explosive stellar fireworks, may be the unsung heroes of dust creation. To settle the score, we need to know how much of this freshly minted dust can survive the intense shockwaves that follow a supernova blast and make it into the interstellar medium.\n\nOur team has developed a cutting-edge code, GRASH_Rev, to track the evolution of dust from its formation in the supernova explosion to its eventual merger with the surrounding interstellar gas. We put our code to the test with four iconic supernovae in the Milky Way and Large Magellanic Cloud: SN1987A, CasA, the Crab Nebula, and N49. The results? Our simulations align perfectly with observations, revealing that a remarkable 1-8% of the dust created in these supernovae can withstand the intense shockwaves and make it into the interstellar medium.\n\nThis means that supernovae produce dust at a rate of (3.9 \u00b1 3.7) \u00d7 10^(-4) M yr^(-1) in the Milky Way, a staggering ten times higher than the dust production rate of aging stars. While this is an impressive feat, it's still not enough to counterbalance the dust destruction caused by supernovae themselves. This leaves us with a tantalizing mystery: where does the rest of the dust come from? The answer, it seems, lies in the accretion of dust in the gas phase. The cosmic dust saga has just gotten a whole lot more interesting!", "This paper explores hatching process strategies for additive manufacturing using high-power electron beams through numerical simulations. Building on validated simulation software, we investigate the limitations of a basic process strategy at higher beam powers and scan velocities, up to 10 kW. We then introduce modified strategies to overcome these limitations, enabling fast and cost-effective production of fully dense parts with smooth top surfaces. These optimized strategies maximize beam power usage, unlocking the full potential of high-power electron beam guns.", "Bayesian optimization is a type of algorithm designed to find the best solution to a complex problem while minimizing the number of attempts. However, traditional Bayesian optimization methods assume that each attempt has the same cost, which is not always the case. In reality, the cost of each attempt can vary greatly depending on the specific conditions. For instance, training a neural network can become much more expensive as the number of layers increases. To address this limitation, cost-aware Bayesian optimization methods have been developed, which measure progress based on cost metrics such as time, energy, or money. One such method is Cost Apportioned Bayesian Optimization (CArBO), which aims to find the best solution while keeping costs as low as possible. CArBO starts with an efficient initial design and then uses a cost-cooled optimization phase that adjusts its cost model as it progresses. In tests on 20 complex problems, CArBO was able to find better solutions than other methods while staying within the same cost budget.", "This work presents a marsupial robotic system combining a legged and aerial robot for collaborative mapping and exploration. The system leverages the strengths of both robots, with the legged robot providing dexterous locomotion and long endurance, and the aerial robot offering 3D navigation capabilities. When the legged robot is hindered by terrain or geometry, it can deploy the aerial robot to explore areas it cannot reach. The two robots share LiDAR-based maps and plan exploration paths autonomously, with the legged robot determining when and where to deploy the aerial robot. Experimental studies demonstrate the system's expanded exploration capabilities and ability to reach previously inaccessible areas.", "We suggest a way to make antiprotons spin in a specific direction in a storage ring. We would use a beam of positrons (the opposite of electrons) that is also spinning in a specific direction and moving alongside the antiprotons. If we get the speed of the positrons just right, they can make the antiprotons spin in the same direction. We've done some calculations that show this can work really well.\n\nTo make this happen, we need a strong beam of positrons. We think we can get this from a special source that uses a radioactive material called $^{11}$C. Another way to do it is to use special light to create the positrons, but this is a bit more complicated. Either way, we can use these positrons to make the antiprotons spin in the same direction, whether they're moving slowly or quickly. It would take about an hour to get a large number of antiprotons spinning in the same direction. This method is about 10 times better than other ways that have been suggested.", "In the context of nucleic acid molecules, loops play a vital role as secondary structure elements, particularly near the melting point. By employing a theoretical framework that incorporates the logarithmic entropy term c ln m for loops of length m, we investigate the behavior of homopolymeric single-stranded nucleic acid chains under the influence of external force and varying temperature. As the chain length approaches infinity, a phase transition emerges between a compact, folded structure at low temperatures and low forces, and a molten, unfolded structure at high temperatures and high forces. We derive the impact of c on phase diagrams, critical exponents, melting points, and force extension curves using analytical methods. Notably, in the absence of external force, a melting transition is only possible within a narrow range of loop exponents (2 < c < 2.479), whereas outside this range, the chain remains either folded (c \u2264 2) or unfolded (c \u2265 2.479). However, applying an external force can induce a melting transition with singular behavior for all loop exponents c < 2.479, which can be experimentally observed using single-molecule force spectroscopy. These findings have significant implications for the hybridization and denaturation of double-stranded nucleic acids. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Poland-Scheraga model, which neglects intra-strand base pairing in denatured regions, can be improved by incorporating realistic loop exponents (c ~ 2.1), leading to the formation of pronounced secondary structures within single strands. This, in turn, affects the melting temperature of the duplex and renormalizes the effective loop exponent c^, influencing universal aspects of the duplex melting transition.", "We investigate the Zeeman spin-splitting in hole quantum wires aligned along the [011] and [01\u03041] crystallographic axes of a high-mobility, undoped (100)-oriented AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructure. Our findings indicate that the spin-splitting can be toggled on (finite g*) or off (zero g*) by rotating the field from a parallel to a perpendicular orientation relative to the wire. Notably, the wire's properties remain identical for both orientations with respect to the crystallographic axes. Furthermore, we observe that the g-factor in the parallel orientation decreases as the wire is narrowed. This contrasts with electron quantum wires, where the g-factor is enhanced by exchange effects as the wire is narrowed. This phenomenon provides evidence for a k-dependent Zeeman splitting, which arises from the spin-3/2 nature of holes.", "Get ready to unlock the secrets of the universe! An ingenious analogy with real Clifford algebras on even-dimensional vector spaces reveals a groundbreaking approach to assigning space and time dimensions modulo 8 to any algebra (represented over a complex Hilbert space) that contains two self-adjoint involutions and an anti-unitary operator with specific commutation relations. And the best part? This assignment is perfectly compatible with the tensor product, meaning the space and time dimensions of the tensor product are simply the sums of the space and time dimensions of its factors! This could be the key to understanding the mysterious presence of such algebras in PT-symmetric Hamiltonians and the behavior of topological matter. But that's not all - this construction also enables us to build an indefinite (i.e. pseudo-Riemannian) version of the spectral triples of noncommutative geometry, defined over Krein spaces instead of Hilbert spaces. Within this revolutionary framework, we can express the Lagrangian (both bosonic and fermionic) of a Lorentzian almost-commutative spectral triple. And as the cherry on top, we've discovered a space of physical states that solves the long-standing fermion-doubling problem! To top it all off, we've even applied this framework to the example of quantum electrodynamics, opening up new avenues for exploration and discovery!", "Unveiling the Hidden Symmetries of the Universe: A Journey Beyond Galilean Physics\n\nDelve into the fascinating realm of space-time symmetries, where we explore the actions of massive free relativistic particles and uncover the secrets of post-Galilean physics. By venturing into canonical space, we reveal the complete set of point space-time symmetries that govern these actions.\n\nBut that's not all - our journey also leads to the discovery of an infinite family of generalized Schr\u00f6dinger algebras, each characterized by an integer M. The M=0 case corresponds to the familiar Schr\u00f6dinger algebra, but what about the others? We dive deeper, examining the Schr\u00f6dinger equations associated with these algebras, their solutions, and the intriguing projective phases that emerge.", "The development of accretion disc theory lags behind stellar evolution theory, despite the ultimate goal of achieving a similarly mature phenomenological picture. A major challenge in this field is incorporating insights from numerical simulations into practical models that can be compared to observations. One crucial aspect that requires more precise incorporation is non-local transport.\n\nTo highlight the need for this, we review the limitations of the practical approach of Shakura-Sunyaev (1973), which is a mean field theory that does not account for large scale transport. Observations of coronae and jets, as well as results from shearing box simulations of the magnetorotational instability (MRI), suggest that a significant portion of disc transport is indeed non-local.\n\nWe demonstrate that the Maxwell stresses in saturation are dominated by large scale contributions, and that the physics of MRI transport cannot be fully captured by a viscosity. We also clarify the standard physical interpretation of the MRI as it applies to shearing boxes.\n\nWhile computational limitations have focused attention on local simulations, the next generation of global simulations is expected to inform improved mean field theories. In fact, mean field accretion theory and mean field dynamo theory should be unified into a single theory that predicts the time evolution of spectra and luminosity from separate disc, corona, and outflow contributions.\n\nUltimately, any mean field theory has a finite predictive precision that must be quantified when comparing predictions to observations. By addressing these challenges, we can work towards a more comprehensive understanding of accretion disc theory.", "This paper investigates the global well-posedness of two Diffuse Interface systems modeling the motion of an incompressible two-phase fluid mixture in a bounded smooth domain $\\Omega\\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$, $d=2,3$, where capillarity effects are present. We examine dissipative mixing effects arising from the mass-conserving Allen-Cahn dynamics with the physically relevant Flory-Huggins potential. Specifically, we consider the Navier-Stokes-Allen-Cahn system for nonhomogeneous fluids and the Euler-Allen-Cahn system for homogeneous fluids. Our analysis, which combines energy and entropy estimates, a novel end-point estimate, a new Stokes problem estimate, and logarithmic type Gronwall arguments, establishes the existence and uniqueness of global weak and strong solutions, as well as their separation from pure states.", "Unlock the secrets of scattering experiments with our groundbreaking Fock-space projection operators!

By applying Fourier transforms to these GPDs, we successfully map the parton distributions of the photon in position space, shedding new light on the photon's internal structure.", "Transformers have revolutionized sequence modeling, but their success comes at a cost: they require massive memory storage to retain all historical token-level representations. To address this efficiency bottleneck, we introduce Memformer, a novel neural network architecture that leverages an external dynamic memory to encode and retrieve past information. This innovative approach enables Memformer to process long sequences with unprecedented efficiency, achieving linear time complexity and constant memory space complexity. Furthermore, we propose a new optimization technique, memory replay back-propagation (MRBP), which facilitates long-range back-propagation through time while significantly reducing memory requirements. Our experimental results demonstrate that Memformer outperforms baseline models while using a remarkable 8.1 times less memory space and achieving 3.2 times faster inference speeds. A closer examination of the attention patterns reveals that our external memory slots effectively encode and retain crucial information across timesteps, underscoring the efficacy of our approach.", "We have calculated the leading logarithmic behavior of the cross-section for producing a pseudoscalar Higgs boson through gluon-gluon fusion, considering all orders of perturbation theory and focusing on the high-energy limit. Additionally, we have determined the Higgs rapidity distribution with the same level of accuracy. Our calculations take into account the contributions of top and bottom quarks, as well as their interference. We express our results in terms of single and double integrals, which we have evaluated explicitly up to the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). By applying our results, we have improved the known NNLO inclusive cross-section, which was previously computed using an effective theory where fermions in the loop were integrated out. We find that finite fermion mass effects on the inclusive cross-section are relatively small, reaching only a few percent even for large pseudoscalar masses.", "Identifying outlying elements in probability distributions can be a challenging problem. To illustrate this, consider the Voting Rights Act enforcement issue of maximizing the number of simultaneous majority-minority districts in a political districting plan. Unbiased random walks on districting plans are unlikely to find optimal solutions. A common approach is to use biased random walks, which favor plans with more majority-minority districts. We propose an alternative method, called short bursts, which involves performing an unbiased random walk for a limited number of steps (burst length), then restarting from the most extreme plan encountered in the previous burst. Our empirical results show that short-burst outperforms biased random walks in maximizing majority-minority districts, with improvements observed across various burst lengths. We also explore the effectiveness of short bursts in more complex state spaces with different probability distributions, abstracting from our use case.", "This study employs molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the wetting properties of graphitic surfaces in contact with various solutions containing 1-8 wt% of commercially available non-ionic surfactants with long hydrophilic chains (up to 160 \u00c5 in length). To efficiently simulate these systems without compromising computational efficiency, a coarse-grained model is necessary. The MARTINI force field with polarizable water is particularly well-suited for this purpose, offering advantages such as faster exploration of long time scales and broader applicability. While the model's accuracy has been questioned, it accurately predicts the wetting properties of pure water on graphitic surfaces, consistent with atomistic simulations and theoretical predictions. However, the model overestimates the micellar formation process in aqueous surfactant solutions, which can be mitigated by initializing surfactants near the contact line. Although simulated equilibrium contact angles exceed experimental values, this study provides valuable guidelines for preliminary surfactant assessment and screening.", "We summarize recent experiments on superfluid $^3$He in nanofluidic sample chambers, highlighting the challenges overcome and the methods developed. These advances enable a systematic study of $^3$He film superfluidity and the surface and edge excitations of topological superfluids.", "Breaking Language Barriers: Unlocking the Power of Code-Mixed Machine Translation in Multilingual Communities\n\nIn today's diverse linguistic landscape, code-mixed machine translation has emerged as a crucial task, enabling seamless communication across languages. As part of the WMT 2022 shared tasks, we took on the challenge of developing a machine translation system that can effortlessly translate between English, Hindi, and Hinglish - a unique blend of both languages.\n\nOur innovative approach tackled two critical tasks: translating monolingual English and Hindi to code-mixed Hinglish, and vice versa. Notably, our system handled both Roman and Devanagari scripts, leveraging monolingual data in both languages. The second task focused solely on Roman script data.\n\nWe're thrilled to report that our system achieved top-tier ROUGE-L and WER scores for the first task, setting a new benchmark for monolingual to code-mixed machine translation. This paper delves into the details of our winning approach, which combined the power of mBART with specialized pre-processing and post-processing techniques, including transliteration from Devanagari to Roman. We also share our experiments for the second task, successfully translating code-mixed Hinglish to monolingual English.", "Recent advances in contrastive learning have demonstrated significant potential in self-supervised spatio-temporal representation learning. However, existing approaches often rely on naive sampling of different clips to construct positive and negative pairs, which inadvertently introduces a bias towards the background scene. This phenomenon can be attributed to two primary factors. Firstly, scene differences tend to be more pronounced and easier to distinguish than motion differences. Secondly, clips extracted from the same video often share similar backgrounds but exhibit distinct motions, leading to the model prioritizing the static background over the motion pattern when these clips are treated as positive pairs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel dual contrastive formulation. Specifically, we decompose the input RGB video sequence into two complementary modalities, namely static scene and dynamic motion. Subsequently, the original RGB features are attracted to the static features and the aligned dynamic features, respectively, thereby enabling the simultaneous encoding of static scene and dynamic motion into a compact RGB representation. Furthermore, we employ feature space decoupling via activation maps to distill static- and dynamic-related features. We refer to our approach as Dual Contrastive Learning for Spatio-Temporal Representation (DCLR). Comprehensive experiments validate that DCLR learns effective spatio-temporal representations, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance on the UCF-101, HMDB-51, and Diving-48 datasets.", "The electronic band structure and Fermi surfaces of ferromagnetic CeRh3B2 are calculated using the FLAPW and LSDA+U methods. By assuming various ground states to describe the 4f electronic state, we propose a fully orbital- and spin-polarized state, |lz=0, sx=1/2>, as the ground state, deviating from the conventional LS-coupled CEF ground state typically expected in 4f compounds. This proposal is supported by the fact that both the observed magnetic moment and dHvA frequencies are well-explained by the calculated electronic structure and Fermi surfaces. The unconventional ground state is stabilized by the strong 4f-4f direct mixing between neighboring Ce atoms along the extremely short distance along the c-axis in the hexagonal crystal cell.", "Simulating matrix acidization in porous media is challenging due to changing porosity. The improved DBF framework can simulate this process by discretizing mass and momentum conservation equations into a pressure-velocity linear system. However, this system can only be solved using direct solvers, which are inefficient for large-scale simulations. To overcome this, we propose a decoupled scheme that breaks down the linear system into two independent systems, one for pressure and one for velocity. These systems can be solved using parallel and iterative solvers, ensuring large-scale simulations can be completed within a reasonable time frame. A numerical experiment demonstrates the correctness and improved efficiency of the decoupled scheme.", "When it comes to understanding the world, two closely linked concepts come into play: sensemaking and narrative. Sensemaking is the way we organize and connect new information with what we already know and have inferred from past experiences. Narratives are a key outcome of this process, providing a more comprehensive view of the world than any single piece of information could on its own. Both are essential to how humans make sense of their surroundings, and would be equally valuable for a computational system trying to do the same. This paper explores the theories behind sensemaking and narrative, and how they help people build a understanding of the world based on the information they encounter. We also examine the connections between sensemaking and narrative research, and highlight the benefits of incorporating these concepts into a specific computational task: visual storytelling. Finally, we describe our system for visual storytelling, which leverages sensemaking and narrative, and share examples from its current implementation.", "The current evaluation metrics used in natural language generation (NLG) are flawed because they are not robust to dialect variations, making it difficult to determine how well systems perform for diverse user groups. In fact, these metrics may even penalize systems for producing text in less common dialects. Unfortunately, there is no existing method to measure how metrics respond to changes in dialect. To address this issue, we define dialect robustness and dialect awareness as key objectives for NLG evaluation metrics. We develop a set of methods and statistical tests to evaluate metrics against these goals. Our analysis reveals that current state-of-the-art metrics are not dialect-robust and are more sensitive to semantic changes than dialect features. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel training approach called NANO, which incorporates regional and language information into the pretraining process of a metric. We demonstrate that NANO provides an efficient way to improve dialect robustness while enhancing performance on standard metric benchmarks.", "Geographic routing uses node position information to improve routing in sensor networks. However, its applicability has been a major challenge. Current approaches either make unrealistic assumptions about wireless networks or use expensive methods to simplify the communication graph. \n\nWe aim to answer three key questions: \n\n1. When should we use geographic routing?\n2. How do we determine if a network is suitable for geographic routing?\n3. In what situations does geographic routing make sense?\n\nTo address these questions, we identify four core principles of geographic routing and explore their impact on network topology. We then introduce a measure called geographic eccentricity to evaluate a network's fitness for geographic routing. Finally, we propose a distributed algorithm that either enables geographic routing or determines if the network's eccentricity is too high.", "Unlocking the secrets of superconductivity, our research reveals that two-band models exhibit a rich tapestry of spatial variation and correlation, governed by two distinct characteristic lengths. This complexity is a significant departure from the simpler dynamics of one-band systems.

Our innovative framework offers a fresh alternative, introducing the concept of termination prediction. This cutting-edge method accurately predicts whether a logic program will terminate, even when conventional proof methods fall short.\n\nWe've made a significant leap forward by establishing a comprehensive characterization of infinite SLDNF-derivations, applicable to a wide range of queries. Our algorithm successfully predicts termination for general logic programs with arbitrary non-floundering queries.\n\nBut don't just take our word for it! Our termination prediction tool has yielded outstanding experimental results. In a benchmark test of 296 programs from the Termination Competition 2007, our tool achieved a remarkable 100% accuracy rate, outperforming state-of-the-art analyzers like AProVE07, NTI, Polytool, and TALP. In fact, our tool successfully predicted termination for 18 programs that were previously unsolvable by these leading analyzers. The only exceptions were five programs that exceeded the experiment time limit.", "Random forests have captured the imagination of researchers and practitioners alike, but despite their popularity, the underlying theory remains shrouded in mystery. In this groundbreaking paper, we shed new light on this complex topic, making two significant contributions to the field. First, we introduce a novel, theoretically sound variant of random regression forests, and rigorously prove its consistency. Then, we put our algorithm to the test, pitting it against other theoretically driven models and the industry-standard random forest algorithm. Our experiments yield fascinating insights into the trade-offs that theorists have made to create tractable models, revealing the secrets behind their success.", "We introduce a novel inference and learning algorithm for Factorial Hidden Markov Models (FHMMs) that overcomes the scalability limitations of traditional methods for sequential data analysis. By combining insights from stochastic variational inference, neural networks, and copula theory, our approach eliminates the need for message passing between latent variables, enabling efficient distributed computing and accelerated learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm maintains the accuracy of established structured mean-field methods while outperforming them on long sequences and large FHMMs.", "To better understand how liquids respond to strong external electric fields, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted on pure water, sodium chloride solutions, and polymer solutions. The goal was to uncover the molecular-level mechanisms behind the formation of liquid bridges and jets, which are crucial in nanofiber production. The simulations revealed that, in the resulting nanoscale structures, molecules align their dipole moments parallel to the applied field throughout the sample. However, the presence of ions can disrupt this alignment, causing the structure to break down into droplets. The threshold field strength required to maintain a stable liquid column was found to depend on ion concentration. Additionally, the simulations observed conformational changes in the polymer during the jetting process.", "In the fast-paced world of content recommendation, one major hurdle remains: matching new users with content that resonates with their unique tastes. As podcasting continues to explode in popularity, traditional approaches to tackling the cold-start problem are put to the test. We dive into the challenge of applying these methods to Spotify's vast library of over 200,000 podcasts, using music consumption behavior as a key to unlocking user preferences. The results are striking: our techniques yield a significant 50% boost in consumption across both offline and online experiments. But that's not all - we also delve into the performance of our models and explore the crucial question: to what extent does music data influence the recommendations, and how can we mitigate bias?", "We investigate the Casimir energy and entropy of two ideal metal spheres at both large and small distances. Our results show that the Helmholtz free energy exhibits non-monotonic behavior with respect to separation and temperature, resulting in regions with negative entropy. Furthermore, we observe non-monotonic entropy behavior with temperature and sphere separation. We explore the origins of this anomalous entropy behavior and its implications for thermodynamics.", "Real-world problems often have high-dimensional or continuous action spaces, making it impossible to evaluate all possible actions. This paper proposes a framework for policy evaluation and improvement using sampled action subsets, applicable to any policy iteration-based reinforcement learning algorithm. We introduce Sampled MuZero, an extension of MuZero that learns in complex action spaces by planning over sampled actions, and demonstrate its effectiveness in Go and two continuous control benchmark domains.", "We introduce two new beamforming methods that use a deep neural network (DNN) trained with multichannel loss functions. Unlike traditional methods that use loss functions designed for monaural speech enhancement, our approach directly optimizes the performance of mask-based beamforming. We achieve this by using multichannel loss functions that evaluate the estimated spatial covariance matrices based on the multichannel Itakura-Saito divergence. Our experiments show that DNNs trained with these loss functions can effectively construct various beamformers and are robust to different microphone configurations.", "Nano-FTIR imaging is a cutting-edge technique that combines FTIR spectroscopy and s-SNOM microscopy to achieve nanometer-scale spatial resolution. However, its sequential data acquisition process limits its ability to capture large spatial areas, resulting in lengthy measurement times. To address this issue, various mathematical approaches have been proposed, all of which rely on acquiring only a small fraction of randomly selected measurements. While these approaches show promise, randomly selecting measurements can be impractical for scanning procedures and may not yield the desired time savings. This study explores alternative sub-sampling schemes that can accelerate data acquisition. The results show that several sub-sampling methods, including original Lissajous, triangle Lissajous, and random reflection sub-sampling, can produce comparable results to random sub-sampling at a 10% rate. This suggests that random sub-sampling is not necessary for efficient data acquisition, opening up new possibilities for faster and more practical nano-FTIR imaging.", "**Key Findings:**\n\n* We calculated screening masses in the deconfined phase of (3+1)d SU(3) pure gauge theory at finite temperature near the transition point, for two different channels of angular momentum and parity.\n* We compared the ratio of these screening masses to those of massive excitations with the same quantum numbers in the 3d 3-state Potts model in the broken phase near the transition point at zero magnetic field.\n* We also studied the inverse decay length of correlations between the real and imaginary parts of the Polyakov loop and compared the results to expectations from perturbation theory and mean-field Polyakov loop models.", "Imagine having a superpower that helps you detect anomalies and threats in complex systems with uncanny accuracy. That's exactly what the Mahalanobis distance-based confidence score has achieved in the realm of pre-trained neural classifiers. This innovative method has been hailed as a game-changer, outperforming its peers in detecting both out-of-distribution and adversarial examples.\n\nBut here's the fascinating part: despite its impressive track record, the Mahalanobis method operates under an assumption that seems too good to be true - that the class conditional distributions of pre-trained features have tied covariance. So, what's behind its remarkable success in real-world scenarios?\n\nOur investigation reveals a surprising twist: the method's strength doesn't stem from its intended purpose of classification prediction confidence, but rather from unrelated information. This means that the conventional wisdom about why the Mahalanobis confidence score works so well is actually misguided.\n\nMoreover, we discovered that this method taps into different insights than another popular anomaly detection approach, ODIN, which relies on prediction confidence. This realization inspired us to combine the two methods, resulting in a powerful detector that boasts improved performance and robustness.\n\nOur findings offer a profound understanding of how neural classifiers respond to anomalous inputs, shedding light on the intricate dynamics at play. By uncovering the secrets behind the Mahalanobis method's success, we can unlock even more effective ways to safeguard our systems against unknown threats.", "Certain algorithms, like those used to differentiate mathematical expressions, work with the underlying structure of the expressions in a way that makes mathematical sense. To formally describe such an algorithm, we need to specify three things: how it works computationally, what it means mathematically, and how to apply it to actual expressions. To achieve this, we need to combine reasoning about the syntax (or structure) of the expressions with reasoning about their meaning.\n\nA syntax framework is a mathematical tool that helps us reason about syntax. It consists of four parts: a way to map expressions to their syntactic structures, a language to reason about these structures, a way to refer to the structure of an expression, and a way to evaluate the expression represented by a structure.\n\nWe compare two approaches to formalizing a mathematical algorithm that relies on syntax. In the first approach, we use a formal theory T to define the syntactic structures of the expressions the algorithm works with. We then use a higher-level theory to define how to quote (or refer to) these structures and how to evaluate them. In the second approach, every expression in T is represented by a syntactic structure, and we define quotation and evaluation as operators within T itself.", "This study explores the dynamics of two consumer-resource systems that interact with each other, modeled using chemostat-like equations. The key assumption is that the resource dynamics unfold at a much slower pace than those of the consumer. This disparity in time scales enables a comprehensive analysis of the system. By separating the fast-scale consumer variables from the slow-scale resource variables, we can examine their phase planes independently. In isolation, each pair exhibits a unique, asymptotically stable steady state, without self-sustaining oscillations (although damped oscillations around equilibrium are possible). However, when the consumer-resource pairs are weakly linked through direct reciprocal inhibition, the entire system displays self-sustaining relaxation oscillations with periods significantly longer than the intrinsic relaxation time of either pair. Notably, the model equations effectively capture the behavior of diverse, locally linked consumer-resource systems, including populations experiencing interspecific interference competition and coupled lasers with cavity losses.", "Despite advances in technology, wireless local area networks (WLANs) still struggle with a significant performance gap between users in the uplink, primarily due to the varying channel conditions inherent in the wireless medium. To address this issue, cooperative medium access control (MAC) protocols, such as CoopMAC, have been proposed. This work reveals that cooperation among nodes involves a critical tradeoff between throughput and bit-cost, or the energy required to transmit a single bit, which is influenced by the level of cooperation. For carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) based networks, we derive the throughput/bit-cost tradeoff curve theoretically. We also introduce fairMAC, a novel distributed CSMA protocol, and demonstrate that it can theoretically achieve any operating point on the tradeoff curve as packet lengths approach infinity. Our theoretical findings are validated through rigorous Monte Carlo simulations.", "Unlock the Power of Social Tagging: Revolutionizing Web Search and Navigation\n\nImagine a world where searching and navigating the web becomes a breeze.

This collaborative approach generates a weighted list of tags that accurately capture the essence of each resource.\n\nWhen combined with traditional classification systems like Wikipedia, social tags open up new avenues for exploration. They offer alternative navigation methods, such as pivot-browsing, popularity-driven navigation, and filtering, making it easier to discover hidden gems. Moreover, social tags provide valuable metadata that can significantly enhance document search, often uncovering insights that lie beyond the content itself.\n\nIn this innovative project, we propose integrating a user-friendly interface for adding custom tags to Wikipedia articles. This game-changing feature has the potential to transform article navigation and retrieval. To test its effectiveness, we've developed a prototype that applies social tagging to Wikipedia.

Classical computers would look at each face one by one, but a quantum computer can process multiple faces simultaneously, making it much faster. This powerful technology, known as Quantum Machine Learning, has gained massive attention worldwide in a short span. Researchers have proposed numerous models that apply quantum principles to classify patterns, but there's a significant gap - most of these models are only tested on artificial data, not real-world datasets. This project aims to bridge that gap by using a quantum classifier to identify patterns with binary attributes. We've successfully applied this classifier to image datasets, achieving promising results, especially in cases where one class is more important than the others, like in medical diagnosis where the rare condition is often the most critical.", "Our investigation focuses on the shock-cloud interaction zone in the southern region of the supernova remnant HB 21, leveraging near- and mid-infrared data collected using the InfraRed Camera (IRC) on the AKARI satellite and the Wide InfraRed Camera (WIRC) at the Palomar 5 m telescope. The IRC images, spanning 4 um (N4), 7 um (S7), and 11 um (S11) bands, as well as the WIRC H2 v=1->0 S(1) 2.12 um image, reveal similar diffuse patterns surrounding a shocked CO cloud. By comparing the emission to H2 line emission from various shock models, we analyzed the data. The IRC colors are consistent with the thermal admixture model, which describes the H2 gas with a power-law relation between infinitesimal H2 column density and temperature, dN \u223c T^(-b)dT. Our findings indicate n(H2) \u2248 3.9 \u00d7 10^4 cm^(-2), b \u2248 4.2, and N(H2; T > 100K) \u2248 2.8 \u00d7 10^21 cm^(-2). We interpreted these parameters in the context of multiple shock-cloud interaction scenarios, including planar C-shocks, bow shocks, and shocked clumps, discussing their strengths and limitations. Notably, the observed H2 v=1->0 S(1) intensity exceeds the prediction from the power-law admixture model by a factor of four, mirroring the trend observed in the northern part of HB 21 (Paper I). Furthermore, we explored the limitations of the thermal admixture model in relation to the derived model parameters.", "Imagine a world where AI models can efficiently process visual data on your smartphone or other resource-constrained devices. Recently, vision transformers have made tremendous progress, outperforming large convolution-based models in many areas. However, when it comes to small models for mobile devices, ConvNets still hold their own, offering a perfect balance of performance and simplicity.\n\nThat's why we're excited to introduce ParC-Net, a game-changing ConvNet-based backbone model that combines the best of both worlds. By fusing the strengths of vision transformers into ConvNets, we've created a powerful and efficient model that's perfect for mobile and resource-constrained devices.\n\nAt the heart of ParC-Net lies our innovative position-aware circular convolution (ParC) operation. This lightweight convolution technique offers a global receptive field while producing location-sensitive features, just like local convolutions. By combining ParC with squeeze-excitation operations, we've created a meta-former-like model block that incorporates attention mechanisms similar to those found in transformers. The best part?

Over the years, researchers have demonstrated various types of air-gap covert channels, including those that use electromagnetic, magnetic, acoustic, optical, and thermal signals. In this paper, we're introducing a new type of vibrational covert channel that takes advantage of the vibrations generated by a computer's internal fans. \n\nWe've discovered that a computer's vibrations are correlated with the speed of its fans, and these vibrations can affect the entire surface on which the computer is placed. Our method involves malware that can control these vibrations by regulating the fan speed. We've found that nearby smartphones can detect these vibrations using their built-in accelerometers, which can be accessed by any app without needing the user's permission. This makes the attack highly difficult to detect.\n\nWe've developed a malware called AiR-ViBeR that encodes data into a low-frequency vibrational signal, which can then be decoded by a malicious app on a nearby smartphone. We discuss the attack model, provide technical background, and share the implementation details and evaluation results. Our results show that AiR-ViBeR can successfully exfiltrate data from an air-gapped computer to a nearby smartphone on the same table, or even an adjacent table, using vibrations. Finally, we propose some countermeasures to prevent this type of attack.", "A comprehensive cost analysis of a 25 W average load magnetic refrigerator utilizing commercial-grade Gadolinium (Gd) is conducted via a numerical modeling approach. The calculation takes into account the expenses associated with magnetocaloric material, magnet material, and operational costs, all of which contribute to the overall expenditure. The results indicate that the minimum total cost, assuming a 15-year device lifespan, falls within the range of $150-$400, largely dependent on the prices of magnetocaloric and magnet materials. Notably, the magnet cost dominates the overall expense, closely followed by operational costs, while the magnetocaloric material cost is relatively insignificant. To achieve the lowest cost, the optimal design parameters are identified as a magnetic field of approximately 1.4 Tesla, a particle size of 0.23 mm, a regenerator length of 40-50 mm, and a utilization rate of around 0.2, which remain consistent across various device lifetimes and material/magnet prices. The operating frequency, however, varies as a function of device lifetime. The performance characteristics of the magnetic refrigeration device are benchmarked against those of a conventional A+++ refrigeration unit, revealing comparable lifetime costs, with the magnetic refrigeration device being slightly more cost-effective, assuming the magnet cost can be recovered at the end of its life.", "We establish the existence of initial data sets that combine an asymptotically flat end with an asymptotically cylindrical end, a geometry commonly referred to as \"trumpets\" in the numerical relativity community.", "**Key Discovery: Enzymes Harness Quantum Effects to Boost Chemical Reactions**\n\nEnzymes have evolved unique protein structures to accelerate complex chemical transformations. Our research reveals a crucial mechanism by which the enzyme ketosteroid isomerase (KSI) exploits quantum effects to enhance its catalytic power.\n\n**Triad of Tyrosine Residues Enables Quantum Proton Delocalization**\n\nWe used experiments and advanced simulations to show that a triad of strongly hydrogen-bonded tyrosine residues in KSI's active site facilitates quantum proton delocalization. This delocalization dramatically stabilizes the deprotonation of an active site tyrosine residue, resulting in a significant isotope effect on its acidity.\n\n**Extended Quantum Proton Delocalization in the Active Site**\n\nWhen an intermediate analog is docked, it integrates into the hydrogen bond network, leading to extended quantum proton delocalization in the active site. Our findings illuminate the critical role of nuclear quantum effects in the hydrogen bond network that stabilizes KSI's reactive intermediate and shed light on proton behavior in biological systems with strong hydrogen bonds.", "We introduce ENSEI, a secure inference framework that enables efficient privacy-preserving visual recognition. By combining homomorphic encryption and secret sharing, we can perform homomorphic convolution in the frequency domain, greatly simplifying the computations involved. \n\nOur approach builds on the frequency-domain secure convolution (FDSC) protocol, which we have designed and optimized using number-theoretic transforms (NTTs). We evaluate the trade-offs between time- and frequency-domain homomorphic convolution in our experiments, demonstrating the advantages of our approach.\n\nThe results are significant: ENSEI achieves 5-11x online time reduction, up to 33x setup time reduction, and up to 10x reduction in overall inference time compared to the best known works. Furthermore, we show that binary neural networks can benefit from an additional 33% bandwidth reduction with only 1% accuracy degradation on the CIFAR-10 dataset.", "Recommender systems are a lifesaver when it comes to dealing with information overload. They help us figure out what we might like from a sea of niche options. Over the years, lots of personalized recommendation algorithms have been developed, and most of them rely on similarities, like collaborative filtering and mass diffusion. We're proposing a new way to measure vertex similarity, called CosRA, which combines the best of both the cosine index and the resource-allocation (RA) index. When we tested CosRA on real-world recommender systems like MovieLens, Netflix, and RYM, we found that it performed better than some benchmark methods in terms of accuracy, diversity, and novelty. Plus, CosRA doesn't require any tweaking of parameters, which makes it super useful in real-life applications. We also experimented with adding two adjustable parameters, but it didn't make a huge difference in CosRA's performance.", "As the need to handle rapidly changing data grows, many real-world applications rely on multi-label data streams. However, these data streams often experience changes in distribution, known as concept drift, which can quickly render existing classification models ineffective. To address this issue, we introduce a new algorithm called Label Dependency Drift Detector (LD3), which is an unsupervised concept drift detector that leverages label dependencies within the data to identify changes in multi-label data streams. Our approach utilizes a label influence ranking method that captures dynamic temporal dependencies between labels, and uses a data fusion algorithm to detect concept drift. Notably, LD3 is the first unsupervised concept drift detection algorithm designed specifically for multi-label classification problems. We evaluate LD3's performance by comparing it to 14 supervised concept drift detection algorithms, adapted for the multi-label problem area, using 12 datasets and a baseline classifier. The results show that LD3 outperforms comparable detectors by 19.8% to 68.6% in terms of predictive performance, on both real-world and synthetic data streams.", "The long-standing debate over the universality of Cepheid Period-Luminosity relations has centered on the potential impact of metallicity effects on the intercept and slope of these relations. This study aims to resolve this issue by calibrating the Galactic Period-Luminosity relations across multiple photometric bands (B to K) and comparing the results to the well-established relations in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Leveraging a robust dataset of 59 calibrating stars with distances measured using five independent methods, we provide a detailed analysis of absorption corrections and projection factors. Our findings reveal no significant difference in the slopes of the Period-Luminosity relations between the LMC and our Galaxy, conclusively demonstrating the universality of these relations across all photometric bands and galaxies (at least for the LMC and Milky Way). While the potential impact of metal content on zero-point variation is beyond the scope of this study, our data suggest an upper limit of 18.50 for the LMC distance modulus.", "It is a well-established fact that ensembling methods significantly enhance prediction accuracy. However, a crucial limitation of these methods is their inability to effectively distinguish between component models. This paper presents a novel approach to stacking with auxiliary features, which enables the fusion of relevant information from multiple systems to achieve superior performance. The incorporation of auxiliary features empowers the stacker to not only consider systems that agree on an output, but also to take into account the provenance of that output. We validate our approach through rigorous testing on three disparate and challenging problems: Cold Start Slot Filling, Tri-lingual Entity Discovery and Linking, and ImageNet object detection tasks. Our results yield new state-of-the-art performance on the first two tasks and substantial improvements on the detection task, unequivocally demonstrating the efficacy and broad applicability of our methodology.", "We've developed a quick and easy way to simulate how magnetization changes in tiny spin-valve structures when driven by spin-torque. Our method combines two tools: one that models spin transport and another that models magnetization dynamics. This approach considers how both spin transport and magnetization dynamics vary in space. We compared our results to real-life experiments and found that they match well. Our method accurately predicts the behavior of spin waves, including the current needed to sustain steady magnetization and the frequency changes of the waves. It also correctly models the giant magnetoresistance effect and magnetization switching. We also discuss the similarities with recently developed spin-caloritronics devices.", "We introduce a straightforward framework for computing hyperbolic Voronoi diagrams of finite point sets, leveraging affine diagrams. Our approach is grounded in the theoretical foundation that bisectors in Klein's non-conformal disk model can be represented as hyperplanes, equivalent to power bisectors of Euclidean balls. Consequently, our method involves a two-stage process: first, computing an equivalent clipped power diagram, followed by a mapping transformation dependent on the chosen representation of hyperbolic space (such as the Poincar\u00e9 conformal disk or upper-plane representations). We also explore extensions of this approach to accommodate weighted and k-order diagrams, and describe their corresponding dual triangulations. Furthermore, we examine the application of two essential primitives on hyperbolic Voronoi diagrams in the context of designing customized user interfaces for an image catalog browsing application in the hyperbolic disk: (1) identifying nearest neighbors, and (2) calculating smallest enclosing balls.", "This study examines the problem of diffusive bond dissociation in a double well potential under the influence of an external force. We calculate the probability distribution of rupture forces and provide a detailed analysis of how finite rebinding probabilities affect the dynamic force spectrum. Our focus is on barrier crossing during extension (under linearly increasing load) and relaxation from completely separated bonds. At high loading rates, the rupture force and rejoining force exhibit the expected loading rate dependence, determined by the potential shape. At low loading rates, the mean forces obtained from pull and relax modes converge as the system reaches equilibrium. We investigate how external parameters, such as cantilever stiffness and the presence of a soft linker, influence the rupture force distributions and mean rupture forces. Our results show that the equilibrium rupture force is either unaffected by the linker or changes predictably with linker compliance, depending on the linker implementation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the equilibrium constant of on- and off-rates can be extracted from the determination of equilibrium rupture forces.", "We introduce a novel approach to identify viscous and turbulent flow regions, including boundary layers and wakes, by utilizing an invariant feature space. Our methodology leverages the principal invariants of strain and rotational rate tensors as inputs to an unsupervised Gaussian mixture model, which is a type of machine learning algorithm. The key advantage of this approach is that it is coordinate-frame independent, as it relies on Galilean-invariant principal invariants of strain and rotational rate. This enables the distinction between two distinct flow regions: a viscous, rotation-dominated region (encompassing boundary layers and wakes) and an inviscid, irrotationally-dominated region (characterizing the outer flow). We validate our methodology by applying it to both laminar and turbulent flow cases (simulated using Large Eddy Simulation) past a circular cylinder at Reynolds numbers of 40 and 3900. The simulations were performed using a high-order nodal Discontinuous Galerkin Spectral Element Method. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of Gaussian mixture clustering in identifying viscous and rotational flow regions. Furthermore, we compare our approach to traditional sensors, highlighting that our method eliminates the need for arbitrary threshold selection, which is a limitation of traditional sensors.", "Quantum systems that we design and build ourselves let us explore some pretty cool phenomena that don't happen naturally. Superconducting circuits are like LEGO blocks, making it easy to create and connect artificial atoms. We've created an artificial molecule by linking two strongly connected fluxonium atoms, which has a magnetic moment that we can adjust. By applying an external magnetic field, we can switch the molecule between two modes: one where it has a magnetic dipole moment and one where it has a magnetic quadrupole moment. When we tweak the external field, we find that the molecule's coherence is limited by local noise. Being able to engineer and control these artificial molecules opens the door to building more complex circuits for super-secure qubits and simulating quantum systems.", "Imagine racing against the clock to make high-stakes decisions that involve a series of complex tasks and unpredictable outcomes. Our method tackles this challenge by harnessing the power of iterative refinement routines, each tackling a different facet of the decision-making puzzle. But here's the catch: we need to orchestrate these routines like a conductor leading an orchestra, allocating precious computational resources to ensure the right notes are played at the right time. This paper shines a spotlight on the master control problem of deliberation scheduling, where every second counts. We present a range of models that capture the diverse scenarios and computational strategies for making decisions under intense time pressure. We explore two approaches: precursor models, where all decisions are made before the clock starts ticking, and recurrent models, where decisions are made on the fly, adapting to new information and anticipating what's to come. We outline algorithms for both approaches and share the results of our real-world experiments, providing a glimpse into the cutting-edge of time-critical decision making.", "A novel approach to designing estimators is presented, known as the role model strategy. This method involves mimicking the output of a superior estimator that has access to better input observations. Under certain Markov conditions, this strategy is proven to produce the optimal Bayesian estimator. The strategy is demonstrated through two simple channel examples. Additionally, it is combined with time averaging to create a statistical model by solving a convex program numerically. Originally developed for low-complexity decoder design in iterative decoding, the role model strategy has potential applications beyond the field of communications.", "Current computer vision systems struggle to accurately recognize objects in artistic representations, such as paintings, cartoons, or sketches, especially when there is limited data available. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method that can recognize objects in artistic modalities without requiring any labeled data from those specific domains. Our approach takes into account the stylistic differences between and within domains, ensuring that the system learns features that are consistent across different artistic styles.\n\nTo achieve this, we create a complementary training modality that mimics the artistic style of the target domain. We then train the network to learn features that are invariant between the two training modalities. Notably, we can generate these artificial labeled source domains automatically using style transfer techniques, which involve applying the style of diverse target images to represent the target domain's style.\n\nUnlike existing methods that require a large amount of unlabeled target data, our approach can work effectively with as few as ten unlabeled images. We evaluate our method on various cross-domain object and scene classification tasks, as well as on a new dataset we are releasing. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach, although conceptually simple, significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation techniques in recognizing objects in artistic representations.", "Delve into the fascinating realm of semi-linear Cauchy problems with quadratic nonlinearity in gradients, where the large time behavior of solutions takes center stage. This paper tackles the complex Cauchy problem with a general state space that may degenerate on its boundary, yielding two striking types of large time behavior: pointwise convergence of the solution and its gradient, and convergence of solutions to associated backward stochastic differential equations. When the state space is R^d or the space of positive definite matrices, we uncover both types of convergence under growth conditions on model coefficients. The far-reaching implications of these large time convergence results have significant applications in risk sensitive control and long term portfolio choice problems, opening up new avenues for exploration and discovery.", "Revolutionizing our understanding of dark energy, the decaying vacuum model (DV) has garnered significant attention in recent studies. By treating dark energy as a dynamic vacuum, the DV model reveals a striking linear decay of vacuum energy with the Hubble parameter in the late universe, resulting in an additional matter component. Leveraging a comprehensive suite of recent datasets - including supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, baryon acoustic oscillations, CMB, Hubble rate, and x-rays in galaxy clusters - we constrain the DV model's parameters with unprecedented precision. Our findings are nothing short of remarkable: the best-fit matter density contrast \u03a9m in the DV model far surpasses that of the \u039bCDM model. We present the confidence contours in the \u03a9m-h plane up to 3\u03c3 confidence level, as well as the normalized likelihoods of \u03a9m and h, respectively. The implications are profound, challenging our current understanding of the cosmos and opening up new avenues for exploration.", "MgO-based Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs) with perpendicular magnetization are ideal components for building Spin Transfer Torque (STT) magnetoresistive memories. However, until now, STT alone has been insufficient to achieve the desired low switching current density of less than 10^6 A/cm^2. Recently, a study published in Nature Materials (Wang et al., 2012) demonstrated the possibility of magnetization switching at ultra-low current densities with the assistance of an electric field. While this phenomenon has been theoretically studied using a macrospin approach, we present a comprehensive micromagnetic analysis. Our findings reveal that the switching process involves a complex nucleation mechanism, including the formation of magnetic vortices.", "Imagine if we could break free from the limitations of traditional perceptron learning algorithms. What if we could harness the power of proximal activation functions to unlock new possibilities in machine learning? Our innovative approach does just that, by generalizing Rosenblatt's classic algorithm to accommodate a broader range of activation functions. But that's not all - we've also discovered that this generalization can be seen as a clever incremental gradient method, cleverly disguised as an energy minimization algorithm. The beauty of this approach lies in its simplicity: by leveraging a generalized Bregman distance, we can sidestep the need to differentiate the activation function, making the entire process more efficient and intuitive. And the best part? This new perspective opens the door to a wide range of novel algorithms, including a fresh take on the iterative soft-thresholding algorithm for sparse perceptrons - a game-changer for anyone looking to push the boundaries of machine learning.", "The phenomenon of radiation force exerted by acoustic waves on objects has been extensively researched since the pioneering work of Rayleigh, Langevin, and Brillouin, leading to significant advancements in acoustic micromanipulation over the past decade. However, previous studies have only derived expressions for the acoustic radiation force on a stationary particle, overlooking the impact of particle displacement on the radiated wave. This study investigates the acoustic radiation force on a translating monopolar source moving at a constant velocity much slower than the speed of sound. Our findings show that the Doppler effect-induced asymmetry in the emitted field generates a radiation force opposing the source's motion.", "Accurately modeling the base of the solar convective envelope poses a significant challenge. Since the discovery of rotation inversions, solar modelers have grappled with the reality that a narrow region has a profound impact on the Sun's overall dynamics. This critical zone, known as the tachocline, marks the transition from differential to solid body rotation and is also thought to be the source of the solar magnetic dynamo. Furthermore, it is influenced by turbulent forces. Notably, current solar models exhibit significant discrepancies with the observed sound speed profile in this region. This paper demonstrates how helioseismology can provide additional constraints on this region by inverting the Ledoux discriminant. We present a comparative analysis of inversions for Standard Solar Models constructed using different opacity tables and chemical abundances, shedding light on the origins of the discrepancies between solar models and the actual Sun.", "Unlocking the Secrets of Human Behavior: A New Era of Collaboration\n\nImagine a world where humans and artificial intelligence work together in perfect harmony. To make this vision a reality, we need to crack the code of human behavior. Research trends reveal a fascinating assumption: human reasoning is the gold standard for artificial intelligence. As a result, game theory, theory of mind, machine learning, and other disciplines are converging to replicate and understand human behavior.\n\nThe next generation of autonomous systems will rely on AI agents and humans working together as a cohesive unit. To achieve this, autonomous agents must be able to incorporate practical models of human behavior, enabling them to not only mimic human actions but also anticipate user behavior and work in tandem with them.\n\nThis paper sets out to provide a comprehensive review of the most influential approaches to modeling human behavior. We'll delve into two key areas: (i) techniques that learn from exploration and feedback, such as Reinforcement Learning, and (ii) direct modeling of human reasoning mechanisms, including beliefs and biases, without relying on trial and error. By exploring these approaches, we can unlock the secrets of human behavior and pave the way for a new era of human-AI collaboration.", "Tackling botnets has long been a significant hurdle. The resilience of command and control (C&C) channels has increased, making it more difficult to identify botmasters in peer-to-peer (P2P) botnets. This paper proposes a probabilistic approach to reconstructing the topologies of C&C channels in P2P botnets. Due to the geographical distribution of P2P botnet members, it is impossible to monitor all members, and there is a lack of necessary data for applying other graph reconstruction methods. Currently, there is no universal method for reconstructing C&C channel topologies for all types of P2P botnets. Our method estimates the probability of connections between bots by utilizing inaccurate receiving times from multiple cascades, network model parameters of the C&C channel, and end-to-end delay distribution of the Internet. These receiving times can be gathered by observing the external responses of bots to commands. Our simulation results show that over 90% of the edges in a 1000-member network with a mean node degree of 50 can be accurately estimated by collecting receiving times from 22 cascades. Even with receiving times from only half of the bots, this level of accuracy can be achieved with 95 cascades.", "In Grand Unified Theories (GUTs), the masses of gaugino particles may not be uniform at the unification scale, which can impact the detection of neutral Higgs bosons (h/H/A) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This study examines the effects of non-uniform gaugino masses on Higgs boson production in a specific decay chain involving gluinos, squarks, and neutralinos. In the universal gaugino mass scenario, only the light Higgs boson can be produced in this decay chain, whereas non-uniform gaugino masses can lead to dominant production of heavy neutral Higgs bosons. The study also explores the allowed parameter space in light of WMAP constraints on dark matter relic density and demonstrates that combining representations can provide the required amount of dark matter in any parameter space point. Furthermore, it is shown that heavy Higgs bosons can be detected in the studied decay chain in regions with preferred neutralino relic density.", "Get ready to revolutionize integrated photonic-electronic circuits with the game-changing power of subwavelength modulators! Despite the challenges posed by weak light-matter interactions, we've cracked the code to designing a modulator that's not only incredibly compact (think nanometer scale footprint!) but also boasts low switching energy, minimal insertion loss, and a massive modulation depth. Introducing our groundbreaking vanadium dioxide dual-mode plasmonic waveguide electroabsorption modulator, built on a cutting-edge metal-insulator-VO$_2$-insulator-metal (MIVIM) waveguide platform! By harnessing the dynamic index of vanadium dioxide, our modulator can seamlessly route plasmonic waves through the low-loss dielectric insulator layer in the \"on\" state and the high-loss VO$_2$ layer in the \"off\" state, resulting in a staggering reduction in insertion loss while maintaining an enormous modulation depth. And the best part? This ultracompact waveguide modulator can achieve a whopping modulation depth of ~10dB with an active size of just 200x50x220nm$^3$ (or ~{\\lambda}$^3$/1700), all while requiring a mere drive-voltage of ~4.6V. This high-performance plasmonic modulator is poised to unlock the full potential of fully-integrated plasmonic nanocircuits in next-generation chip technology - the future is bright, and it's arriving faster than you think!", "As vehicles become increasingly connected, combating automobile theft has become a pressing concern. To address this issue, various countermeasures have been proposed, including data mining, biometrics, and additional authentication methods. Among these, data mining has emerged as an effective approach to capture the unique characteristics of owner-drivers. Previous studies have applied diverse algorithms to driving data to distinguish owner-drivers from thieves. However, these supervised learning-based methods require labeled datasets, which is impractical when it comes to gathering and applying thief driving patterns. To overcome this limitation, we propose a driver identification method utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The key advantage of GANs lies in their ability to build identification models using only owner-driver data. We trained a GAN solely with owner-driver data and employed the trained discriminator to identify the owner-driver. Our evaluation using actual driving data demonstrates that our identification model accurately recognizes owner-drivers. By integrating our proposed model with other driver authentication methods, we anticipate that the industry can develop effective automobile theft countermeasures for real-world implementation.", "Measuring electronic structure parameters in quasi-two-dimensional metals can be achieved through the convenient method of slow oscillations (SlO) of magnetoresistance. We explore the potential of applying this approach to multi-band conductors, such as iron-based high-temperature superconducting materials. Our findings indicate that SlO can effectively measure the interlayer transfer integral in multi-band conductors, similar to its application in single-band metals. Furthermore, SlO enables the measurement and comparison of effective masses and electron scattering rates across different bands.", "This review covers recent progress in precision LHC calculations for Standard Model processes, including weak gauge-boson and Higgs-boson production, as presented at the 2015 Rencontres de Blois.", "This paper presents a novel approach to speech emotion recognition that leverages both speech features and speech transcriptions (text). The speech features, including Spectrogram and Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), are effective in capturing low-level emotional characteristics in speech, while the text provides valuable insights into the semantic meaning of the spoken words. By combining these two sources of information, our approach can detect emotions more accurately. We experimented with various Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures, each designed to process different combinations of speech features and text inputs. Our results show that the proposed network architectures outperform existing state-of-the-art methods on a benchmark dataset. Notably, the combined MFCC-Text Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model achieved the highest accuracy in recognizing emotions in the IEMOCAP dataset.", "We propose integrating variational semantic memory into meta-learning to enable few-shot learning with long-term knowledge. This memory module accumulates and stores semantic information in a hierarchical Bayesian framework, growing from scratch and consolidating through task experience. It adapts to individual tasks through principled memory recall, allowing efficient accrual and adaptation of semantic information. Our approach outperforms deterministic methods, achieving state-of-the-art results on four benchmarks and demonstrating the benefits of variational semantic memory for few-shot recognition.", "Unlocking the Secrets of Tetraquarks: A Groundbreaking Approach to Unraveling their Mysteries\n\nIn a major breakthrough, we have successfully derived the relativistic four-quark equations that incorporate open-charm and open-strange components within the coupled-channel formalism. By dynamically mixing meson-meson states with four-quark states, we have constructed amplitudes that encompass all four quark flavors (u, d, s, c). The poles of these amplitudes hold the key to determining the masses of tetraquarks, and our calculations have yielded mass values for these exotic particles with spin-parity JP=1-,2-. This pioneering work opens up new avenues for understanding the properties and behavior of tetraquarks, shedding light on the mysteries of these enigmatic particles.", "Get ready to revolutionize your cosmological forecasting with the Fisher Matrix, the game-changing tool that's taking the scientific community by storm!

We're confident that Fisher4Cast will become an indispensable tool for cosmologists and scientists everywhere, and we can't wait to see the incredible things you'll achieve with it!", "The formalism of knowledge representation grounded in first-order logic effectively captures the nuances of natural language and accommodates multiple probabilistic inference models. While symbolic representation facilitates quantitative reasoning with statistical probability, its integration with machine learning models, which operate on numerical computations, poses significant challenges. In contrast, knowledge embedding, which involves the use of high-dimensional and continuous vectors, offers a viable approach to complex reasoning, enabling the preservation of semantic information and the establishment of quantifiable relationships among knowledge entities. This paper proposes the Recursive Neural Knowledge Network (RNKN), a novel framework that combines medical knowledge grounded in first-order logic with recursive neural networks for multi-disease diagnosis. Following efficient training on manually annotated Chinese Electronic Medical Records (CEMRs), the RNKN model learns diagnosis-oriented knowledge embeddings and weight matrices. Experimental results demonstrate that the diagnostic accuracy of RNKN surpasses that of classical machine learning models and Markov Logic Networks (MLNs). Furthermore, the results indicate that the performance of RNKN improves as the explicitness of evidence extracted from CEMRs increases. Notably, the RNKN model exhibits increasingly interpretable knowledge embeddings as the number of training epochs increases.", "Deep within the electron cooler device, a series of solenoids work in tandem to precision-guide the electron beam. However, these solenoids have a hidden impact on the ion beam circulating in the adjacent storage ring. If not perfectly calibrated, the solenoids can disrupt the ion beam's transverse motion, causing it to become inextricably linked. This paper delves into the consequences of uncompensated solenoids in the CSRm storage ring at the Institute of Modern Physics in Lanzhou, China, and presents a novel method for calculating the resulting coupled beam envelopes.", "A near-infrared excess has been detected at the white dwarf PHL5038 in UKIDSS photometry, indicating the presence of a cool, substellar companion. \n\nUsing NIRI on Gemini North, we obtained H- and K-grism spectra and images of PHL5038. The target was resolved into two components: an 8000K DA white dwarf and a likely L8 brown dwarf companion, separated by 0.94\". \n\nThe spectral type of the secondary was determined using standard spectral indices for late L and T dwarfs. The projected orbital separation of the binary is 55AU, making it only the second known wide WD+dL binary, after GD165AB. \n\nThis object has the potential to be used as a benchmark for testing substellar evolutionary models at intermediate to older ages.", "\"Unveiling the Hidden Secrets of the Milky Way: How Dynamical Streams and Substructure Shape Our Understanding of Galaxy Mass\"\n\nIn a groundbreaking study, we delve into the mysteries of the Milky Way's mass and escape speed, revealing the profound impact of dynamical streams and substructure on our estimates. By harnessing the power of high-resolution, magneto-hydrodynamical cosmological simulations, we uncover the intricate phase space structure of local volumes around solar-like positions, exposing significant variations between positions within individual galaxies and across the suite.\n\nOur findings show that substructure unevenly populates the high-velocity tail, leading to discrepancies in mass estimates. A complex interplay of streams, sample noise, and truncation of the high-velocity tail below the escape speed gives rise to a distribution of mass estimates with a median that falls short of the true value by a staggering 20%, and a spread of a factor of 2 across the suite.\n\nBy correcting for these biases, we arrive at a revised estimate of the Milky Way's mass, presented in Deason et al., of 1.29 \u00d7 10^12 M, with a range of +0.37 to -0.47 \u00d7 10^12 M. This breakthrough sheds new light on the intricate dynamics of our galaxy, offering a more accurate understanding of the Milky Way's true nature.", "Unlocking the Power of Light: Revolutionary Object Recognition with a Twist\n\nImagine a world where a single photon can reveal more than just a single bit of information. Our innovative approach harnesses the potential of high-dimensional correlated orbital angular momentum (OAM) states to achieve unprecedented information extraction rates in object recognition.\n\nThe magic lies in the correlations, which remain unaffected by the target object's axial rotation. Like a fingerprint, the object's joint OAM coincidence spectrum remains unchanged, even when rotated randomly between measurements.\n\nBut that's not all. Our method can fully reconstruct complex, off-axis objects using OAM correlations alone, revealing novel symmetries in the phases of OAM-object interactions. We've also explored how mutual information rates vary with off-axis translation in the beam field, discovering that object symmetry signatures and information rates remain independent of environmental factors at a safe distance from the beam center.\n\nThe implications are profound, paving the way for dynamic scanning applications in scenarios where symmetry and minimal, non-invasive measurements are crucial. Get ready to unlock the secrets of light and revolutionize object recognition!", "During its initial two orbits, the Parker Solar Probe detected widespread instances of rapid magnetic field reversals, known as switchbacks, which were predominantly found in the solar wind near the Sun. These switchbacks appeared in patches and may be connected to various phenomena, including magnetic reconnection at the Sun's surface. Since switchbacks are linked to faster plasma flows, we investigated whether they are hotter than the surrounding plasma and if their internal microphysics differ from their environment. By analyzing data from the Solar Probe Cup instrument during periods of significant angular deflections, we compared parallel temperatures within and outside switchbacks. Our findings suggest that the distribution functions inside switchbacks are consistent with a rigid rotation of the background plasma in phase space. Consequently, we conclude that the proton core parallel temperature remains the same both inside and outside switchbacks, indicating that the temperature-velocity relationship does not apply within magnetic field switchbacks. Furthermore, our results support the idea that switchbacks are Alfv\u00e9nic pulses traveling along open magnetic field lines, although their origin remains unknown. Additionally, we found no clear correlation between radial Poynting flux and kinetic energy enhancements, suggesting that radial Poynting flux does not play a significant role in switchback dynamics.", "The Nainital-Cape Survey has led to the discovery of eight \u03b4 Scuti-type pulsators, which exhibit pulsation periods ranging from several minutes to a few hours. To better understand these observed pulsational variations, we conducted non-adiabatic linear stability analyses on models of these stars with masses between 1 and 3 solar masses. Our results show that several low-order p-modes are unstable, with pulsation periods that align well with the observed periods. Specifically, we found that the observed variabilities of HD 118660, HD 113878, HD 102480, HD 98851, and HD 25515 can be attributed to low-order radial p-mode pulsations.", "A new way of understanding how particles move in theories that violate Lorentz symmetry is proposed. By using an extended Hamiltonian approach, a connection is made between the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian frameworks, allowing for the calculation of particle trajectories in both momentum and velocity spaces. This method avoids certain problematic points that arise in the theory by requiring smooth trajectories in both velocity and momentum variables. Additionally, specific solutions to the Lagrangian can be identified by looking at specific parts of the dispersion relations. Examples of this approach are worked out in detail for a type of Finsler function, and a direct link is established between the Lagrangians and solutions to the Dirac equation in a special case.", "Effective spectrum management is essential for cognitive radio networks (CRNs). While most research focuses on individual aspects of spectrum management, such as sensing, decision, sharing, or mobility, we argue that integrating multiple tasks can improve spectrum efficiency in certain network configurations. This two-part paper addresses the uplink resource management problem in a CRN with multiple cognitive users (CUs) and access points (APs). To maximize transmission rates, CUs must associate with a suitable AP and share channels with other CUs. We aim to develop an efficient, distributed solution to these interdependent tasks, which remains an open problem in the literature.", "A simple statistical model is presented to describe baryonic matter in core-collapsing supernovae. The model exhibits a first-order phase transition in the grandcanonical ensemble, but not in the canonical ensemble. This ensemble inequivalence is accompanied by negative susceptibility and discontinuities in intensive observables. This behavior arises from the interplay between attractive strong forces and repulsive electromagnetic interactions, partially screened by electrons. This phenomenon is expected in any theoretical treatment of nuclear matter in stellar environments and has implications for supernova dynamics.", "To achieve high performance in a Terahertz Free Electron Laser (THz-FEL), a compact injector design was proposed. Instead of using a complex and expensive photo-cathode, a thermionic cathode was chosen to emit electrons. The injector's performance was improved by using an enhanced RF gun, which increased the effective bunch charge to approximately 200 picocoulombs and minimized back bombardment effects. The accelerator structures were designed to boost the energy to around 14 million electronvolts, while a focusing system was used to maintain the bunch state and suppress emittance. The physical design and beam dynamics of the key components were analyzed, and simulations were run using MATLAB and Parmela to test the performance of the injector with multiple pulses. The results showed that the injector can consistently produce high-brightness electron bunches with low energy spread and emittance.", "The cosmic microwave background anisotropy data from WMAP has sparked numerous claims of anomalies at large angles. However, most of these claims are difficult or impossible to verify due to the use of statistics chosen after the fact. Despite this challenge, the potential discovery of new physics on the largest observable scales is too exciting to ignore. In this review, I will scrutinize three specific claims: the lack of large-angle power, the north-south power asymmetry, and multipole alignments. To overcome the limitations of a posteriori statistics, we need a new dataset that probes similar physical scales to the large-angle CMB. While this is a daunting task, there are promising avenues to explore.", "Get ready to revolutionize multi-photon states! By harnessing the power of multiple parametric down conversion (PDC) processes, we can generate these states with ease. The secret lies in pumping nonlinear crystals with high energy, unlocking a world of possibilities. The more populated these states become, the more they defy local realistic descriptions, pushing the boundaries of what's thought possible! However, high pumping can lead to low interference contrast in multi-photon PDC experiments - but fear not! We've got a game-changing solution that leverages cutting-edge optical devices: multiport beam splitters. These marvels can split incoming light into a staggering M output modes, effectively acting as a POVM filter. The result? A feasible CHSH-Bell inequality test that can simplify communication complexity like never before!", "Imagine a particle moving through a lattice with a disordered potential. The transfer matrix, a mathematical tool, helps us understand how this particle behaves. Specifically, the exponents of the transfer matrix reveal the localization lengths of Anderson's model. \n\nI've discovered a way to calculate these exponents using two mathematical identities: a duality identity for determinants and Jensen's identity for subharmonic functions. This approach provides an exact formula for the spectrum, which is surprisingly based on the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian with non-Hermitian boundary conditions. The best part? This formula involves averaging over a Bloch phase, rather than the disorder itself.\n\nTo test this approach, I've conducted a preliminary investigation of the non-Hermitian spectra of Anderson's model in one and two dimensions, focusing on the smallest exponent. The results are promising, and I'm excited to share them with you.", "We've found a way to make extreme learning machines better at predicting continuous values. We assume that the data we're trying to predict is connected in some way, like a network. We use this idea to make the machine's output more consistent and smooth. When we tested this approach with real data, we found that it works much better when we don't have a lot of data and the data is noisy.", "**Accurate Modeling of Heating in Turbulent Plasmas Requires Nonlinear Collisional Operators**\n\nTo correctly describe heating in weakly collisional turbulent plasmas, such as the solar wind, it is crucial to account for inter-particle collisions. These collisions convert ordered energy into heat through irreversible relaxation towards thermal equilibrium. Recent research has shown that fine structures in velocity space enhance plasma collisionality (Pezzi et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 2016).\n\n**Nonlinear vs. Linearized Landau Operators: A Comparative Analysis**\n\nThis study compares the effects of fully nonlinear and linearized Landau operators on the relaxation of an out-of-equilibrium distribution function in a homogeneous force-free plasma. The results highlight the importance of retaining nonlinearities in the collisional operator to quantify collisional effects accurately.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n* Both nonlinear and linearized operators recover multiple characteristic times associated with the dissipation of different phase space structures.\n* However, the influence of these times differs significantly between the two cases.\n* The linearized operator yields systematically larger characteristic times, indicating that fine velocity structures are dissipated more slowly when nonlinearities are neglected in the collisional operator.\n\nIn summary, this study demonstrates that nonlinear collisional operators are essential for accurately modeling heating in turbulent plasmas, as they capture the complex interactions between particles and velocity structures.", "The semiconductor defect inspection domain faces a significant challenge: detecting and classifying defects during manufacturing as circuit pattern dimensions continue to shrink (e.g., to pitches less than 32 nm). Current state-of-the-art optical and e-beam inspection tools rely on rule-based techniques, which often lead to misclassification and require human expert intervention.\n\nTo address this challenge, we have applied Mask-RCNN, a deep-learning algorithm for computer vision and object detection, to develop a more effective defect inspection and analysis method. Building on our previous work, we have extended our deep learning-based approach to achieve improved defect instance segmentation in SEM images. This enables us to generate a precise mask for each defect category/instance, extract and calibrate each segmented mask, and quantify the pixels that make up each mask.\n\nOur approach allows us to count each categorical defect instance and calculate the surface area in terms of pixels. We are specifically targeting the detection and segmentation of various inter-class stochastic defect patterns, including bridge, break, and line collapse, as well as differentiating between intra-class multi-categorical defect bridge scenarios (e.g., thin/single/multi-line/horizontal/non-horizontal) for aggressive pitches and thin resists (High NA applications).\n\nOur proposed approach has demonstrated its effectiveness both quantitatively and qualitatively, offering a promising solution for the semiconductor defect inspection domain.", "We establish a new bound on the parameter \u03bb (the number of common neighbors of adjacent vertices) in distance-regular graphs, improving and generalizing the bounds for strongly regular graphs obtained by Spielman (1996) and Pyber (2014). This new bound is a key component in recent advances on the complexity of testing isomorphism of strongly regular graphs (Babai et al., 2013). Our proof relies on a clique geometry discovered by Metsch (1991) under certain parameter constraints. Additionally, we provide a simplified proof of the following asymptotic consequence of Metsch's result: if k\u03bc = o(\u03bb\u00b2), then each edge of G belongs to a unique maximal clique of size asymptotically equal to \u03bb, and all other cliques have size o(\u03bb). Here, k denotes the degree, and \u03bc represents the number of common neighbors of vertices at distance 2. Notably, Metsch's cliques are \"asymptotically Delsarte\" when k\u03bc = o(\u03bb\u00b2), implying that families of distance-regular graphs with parameters satisfying k\u03bc = o(\u03bb\u00b2) are \"asymptotically Delsarte-geometric.\"", "Understanding the diversity of galactic-scale star formation requires insight into the formation and evolution of giant molecular clouds in various environments. Recent observations have shown that star formation activity changes depending on the galactic environment. In particular, strongly barred galaxies have been found to lack massive stars, despite having sufficient molecular gas to form them.\n\nTo investigate this phenomenon, we conducted a hydrodynamical simulation of a strongly barred galaxy, using a stellar potential based on observational results from NGC1300. We compared cloud properties in different regions, including the bar, bar-end, and spiral arms. Our results showed that the mean virial parameter of clouds is around 1, with no environmental dependence. This suggests that the gravitationally-bound state of clouds is not responsible for the lack of massive stars in strong bars.\n\nInstead, we explored the role of cloud-cloud collisions, which have been proposed as a triggering mechanism for massive star formation. Our analysis revealed that collision speeds in the bar are faster than in other regions. By examining the collision frequency using cloud kinematics, we found that the fast collisions in the bar may be caused by the random-like motion of clouds due to elliptical gas orbits shifted by the bar potential.\n\nOur findings suggest that the observed lack of active star formation in strong bars is likely due to the fast cloud-cloud collisions, which are inefficient in forming massive stars. This is a result of the galactic-scale violent gas motion, which is driven by the bar potential.", "Exploring the Mass-Metallicity Relationship in Star-Forming Galaxies\n\nThe connection between a galaxy's mass and its metal content has been well-documented, but the exact nature of this relationship remains a topic of debate. Our goal is to investigate this relationship using data from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey and compare our findings to those from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).\n\nTo achieve this, we employed strong emission line ratio diagnostics to determine oxygen abundances. We then applied various selection criteria, including minimum signal-to-noise ratios for different emission lines and apparent and absolute magnitude limits, to examine how these factors influence the mass-metallicity relationship.\n\nOur results show that the shape and position of the mass-metallicity relationship can vary significantly depending on the metallicity calibration and selection criteria used. However, after identifying a robust metallicity calibration, we found that the mass-metallicity relationship for galaxies in the GAMA survey with redshifts between 0.061 and 0.35 is consistent with that observed in the SDSS, despite the difference in luminosity ranges.\n\nOur study highlights the importance of considering the impact of sample selection criteria and methodology when comparing the mass-metallicity relationship across different surveys and studies. Additionally, we suggest that there may be a moderate level of evolution in the mass-metallicity relationship within the GAMA sample over the redshift range 0.06 to 0.35.", "By applying thermodynamic principles, we've developed a set of equations that connect the seepage velocities of different fluid components in two-phase flow through porous media. This approach requires us to introduce a new concept: the co-moving velocity, which is a unique property of the porous medium itself. When combined with a relationship between velocities and driving forces, such as pressure gradients, these equations form a complete system. We've used this theory to analytically solve four versions of the capillary tube model, and we've also tested it numerically using a network model.", "The biosphere's staggering diversity of form and function is a hallmark of life that sets it apart from non-living matter. It's no wonder, then, that this aspect of life has become a central focus of artificial life research. As we've known since Darwin, this diversity is dynamically produced through the process of evolution, which has been dubbed Open-Ended Evolution (OEE) in the field. This article introduces the second of two special issues dedicated to current research in OEE, providing an overview of both issues' contents. The majority of the work presented here was showcased at the 2018 Conference on Artificial Life in Tokyo, building upon previous workshops held in Cancun and York. We offer a simplified categorization of OEE and summarize the progress made in the field, as represented by the articles in this special issue.", "The properties of MgO/Ag(001) ultrathin films with substitutional Mg atoms in the interface metal layer were investigated using Auger electron diffraction, ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.\n\nThe study found that:\n\n* The incorporation of Mg atoms at the interface causes a strong distortion of the interface layers.\n* This distortion leads to a significant reduction in the work function (0.5 eV) due to band-offset variations at the interface.\n* DFT calculations confirm the induced lattice distortion and reveal an electron transfer from Mg to Ag atoms in the metallic interface layer.\n* The local lattice distortion is caused by Coulomb interactions between O2- ions and Mg/Ag neighbors.\n* However, the effect of lattice distortion on work function reduction is limited.\n* The main contributor to the work function changes is the increase in electrostatic compression effect.\n\nOverall, the incorporation of Mg atoms at the interface of MgO/Ag(001) ultrathin films significantly affects the metal/oxide electronic structure and work function.", "The necessity to monitor industrial processes and detect deviations in process parameters in a timely manner to rectify potential issues has spawned a distinct area of interest. This becomes particularly crucial and complex when the measured values fall below the sensitivity thresholds of the measurement system or detection limits, resulting in incomplete observations. Such instances are referred to as incomplete observations or left-censored data. In cases where the level of censorship exceeds 70%, traditional process monitoring methods are rendered ineffective. Therefore, it is essential to employ specialized statistical techniques for data analysis to accurately assess the process state at any given time. This paper proposes a methodology for estimating process parameters in such scenarios and presents a corresponding control chart, which is derived from an algorithm that is also presented.", "Clustering is crucial in many data-driven applications, but most research focuses on distance functions and algorithms. We propose Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC), a method that uses deep neural networks to learn feature representations and cluster assignments simultaneously. DEC maps data to a lower-dimensional space and iteratively optimizes clustering objectives, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in image and text datasets.", "Unlocking the Secrets of Network Burstiness: A Groundbreaking Study\n\nBuilding on the pioneering work of Sarvotham et al. [2005], we delve deeper into the fascinating relationship between peak transmission rate and network burstiness. By analyzing TCP packet headers, we identify and characterize individual sessions using a unique 5-tuple signature. However, our research reveals that the traditional definition of peak rate is no longer sufficient. We shatter the conventional approach by segmenting sessions into 10 distinct groups based on empirical quantiles of peak rate, exposing the hidden heterogeneity within the previously defined beta group.\n\nOur refined segmentation uncovers previously unknown patterns and structures that were masked by the traditional two-group approach. We discover that the dependence between key session variables varies significantly across groups, and that session initiation times follow a Poisson process within each segment - a property that disappears when viewed at the aggregate level. These findings have profound implications for understanding network behavior and simulating real-world data.\n\nWe present a simple yet powerful method for simulating network traffic, informed by our research. This breakthrough has the potential to revolutionize the way we model and predict network performance, enabling more efficient and reliable data transmission.", "The Brouwer fixed-point theorem, a fundamental concept in topology, asserts that any continuous function mapping a compact convex set onto itself must have at least one fixed point. In other words, there exists a point x\u2080 such that the function f(x\u2080) equals x\u2080 itself. Interestingly, under specific conditions, this fixed point can be correlated with the throat of a traversable wormhole, where the shape function b(r) satisfies the equation b(r\u2080) = r\u2080. This mathematical connection has significant implications, as it allows us to infer the possible existence of wormholes solely through mathematical reasoning, without relying on additional physical assumptions or hypotheses.", "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been increasingly utilized to address challenges in both computer vision and medical image analysis. Notwithstanding their widespread adoption, the majority of existing approaches are limited to processing two-dimensional images, whereas most medical data employed in clinical practice comprises three-dimensional volumes. This study proposes a novel approach to three-dimensional image segmentation, predicated on a volumetric, fully convolutional neural network. Our CNN is trained in an end-to-end manner on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumes of the prostate, enabling it to predict segmentation for the entire volume simultaneously. We introduce a novel objective function, optimized during training, based on the Dice coefficient. This approach allows us to effectively address situations characterized by a significant imbalance between the number of foreground and background voxels. To mitigate the limited availability of annotated volumes for training, we employ data augmentation techniques, including random non-linear transformations and histogram matching. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach achieves satisfactory performance on challenging test data, while requiring a significantly reduced processing time compared to previous methods.", "It is a well-established fact that the energy spectrum of a non-relativistic two-body system interacting via the Coulomb potential is described by the Balmer series, E_n = \u03b1^2m / 4n^2, as derived from the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. However, a groundbreaking discovery was made by Wick and Cutkosky in 1954, who revealed that when \u03b1 > \u03c0/4, relativistic effects give rise to new energy levels beyond the Balmer series, using the Bethe-Salpeter equation framework. Despite this finding, the physical nature of these additional states remained shrouded in mystery, leading to skepticism about their existence. Our recent research has shed light on this enigma, demonstrating that these extra states are, in fact, dominated by the exchange of massless particles moving at the speed of light. This fundamental insight explains why they were absent in the non-relativistic Schr\u00f6dinger framework, and underscores the significance of incorporating relativistic effects in our understanding of two-body systems.", "We investigate the fundamental properties of the quantum f-relative entropy, which is defined in terms of an operator convex function f(.). We establish the equality conditions for monotonicity and joint convexity, providing more general results that apply to a broader class of operator convex functions. Notably, our conditions differ from the previously known conditions for the specific case of f(t) = -ln(t). We also define the quantum f-entropy in terms of the quantum f-relative entropy and examine its properties, deriving equality conditions in certain cases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the f-generalizations of the Holevo information, entanglement-assisted capacity, and coherent information all satisfy the data processing inequality, and we provide the equality conditions for the f-coherent information.", "Imagine a world where computer vision tasks aren't thrown off by a simple image rotation or shift. That's the goal, but it's not quite a reality yet. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can handle translations with ease, rotations are a different story. Typically, we rely on data augmentation to achieve rotation equivariance, but that's not enough. We need a more elegant solution.\n\nThat's where Harmonic Networks, or H-Nets, come in. Our innovative approach replaces traditional CNN filters with circular harmonics, allowing the network to detect the maximum response and orientation for every patch of the image. The result is a powerful, efficient, and computationally lightweight representation that can tackle even the most complex rotational invariants.\n\nWe've tested H-Nets with the latest architectures and techniques, including deep supervision and batch normalization, and the results are impressive. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art classification on rotated-MNIST and holds its own against other benchmark challenges. With H-Nets, we're one step closer to making computer vision tasks truly rotation- and translation-invariant.", "We investigate the reflection spectra of directly coupled waveguide-cavity systems, gaining insight into the reflection and coupling mechanisms through the observed Fano lines. In contrast to side-coupled systems, the Fano line shape is influenced by the coupling between the measurement fiber and the waveguide, rather than the waveguide termini. Our experimental results and analytical model reveal that the Fano parameter, which characterizes the Fano line shape, is highly sensitive to the coupling conditions. Even a slight movement of the fiber, within the Rayleigh range, can significantly alter the Fano line shape.", "Get ready to revolutionize the world of astronomy! The strength and vertical distribution of atmospheric turbulence are crucial factors in determining the performance of optical and infrared telescopes, with or without adaptive optics. And now, we're thrilled to introduce a groundbreaking new technique that's about to make measuring this turbulence a whole lot easier! Using a sequence of short-exposure images of a star field captured with a small telescope, we can calculate the structure functions of longitudinal and transverse wavefront tilt for a range of angular separations. By comparing these results with theoretical predictions from simple turbulence models using a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo optimization, we can estimate the turbulence profile in the lower atmosphere, the total and free-atmosphere seeing, and the outer scale with unprecedented accuracy! But don't just take our word for it - we've run extensive Monte-Carlo simulations to verify the technique, and we're excited to share some stunning examples using real data from the second AST3 telescope at Dome A in Antarctica. The possibilities are endless, and we can't wait to see the impact this will have on the future of astronomy!", "An n-plectic structure is defined as a commutative and torsion-free Lie Rinehart pair, accompanied by a distinguished cocycle within its Chevalley-Eilenberg complex. This n-plectic cocycle induces an extension of the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex by symplectic tensors, which in turn gives rise to a cohomology that generalizes Hamiltonian functions and vector fields to tensors and cotensors across a range of degrees, modulo certain coboundaries. This cohomology possesses the structure of a Lie \u221e-algebra. Furthermore, we demonstrate that momentum maps emerge in this context as weak Lie \u221e-morphisms from an arbitrary Lie \u221e-algebra to the Lie \u221e-algebra of Hamiltonian (co)tensors.", "Amorphous solids, also referred to as glasses, are characterized by stretched-exponential decay over extensive time intervals in various macroscopic observables, including the intermediate scattering function, dielectric relaxation modulus, and time-elastic modulus. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced in the vicinity of the glass transition. In this Letter, we demonstrate, using dielectric relaxation as an exemplar, that stretched-exponential relaxation is inherently linked to the distinctive lattice dynamics of glasses. By reformulating the Lorentz model of dielectric matter in a more general framework, we express the dielectric response as a function of the vibrational density of states (DOS) for a random assembly of spherical particles interacting harmonically with their nearest neighbors. Notably, our findings indicate that, near the glass transition (which coincides with the Maxwell rigidity transition), the dielectric relaxation exhibits perfect consistency with stretched-exponential behavior, characterized by Kohlrausch exponents in the range of 0.56 < \u03b2 < 0.65, which is consistent with the range observed in most experimental systems. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the underlying cause of stretched-exponential relaxation can be attributed to the presence of soft modes (boson-peak) in the DOS.", "This paper underscores the complexities of achieving representation disentanglement in the text domain under unsupervised conditions. To this end, we select a paradigmatic set of models that have demonstrated success in the image domain and assess their performance on six disentanglement metrics, as well as downstream classification tasks and homotopy. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation, we introduce two synthetic datasets with known generative factors. Our experimental results underscore the existing disparity in the text domain and reveal that certain factors, such as representation sparsity as an inductive bias and representation coupling with the decoder, can significantly impact disentanglement. Notably, our study constitutes the first exploration of the intersection of unsupervised representation disentanglement and text, providing a foundational framework and datasets for future research in this area.", "This paper presents a novel hybrid quantum-classical algorithm designed to tackle the fundamental unit commitment (UC) problem in power systems. To address this complex challenge, the UC problem is decomposed into three distinct subproblems: a quadratic subproblem, a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) subproblem, and an unconstrained quadratic subproblem. A classical optimization solver is employed to resolve the first and third subproblems, while the QUBO subproblem is addressed using the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). The three subproblems are then iteratively coordinated via a three-block alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm. Simulation results, obtained using Qiskit on the IBM Q system, validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in solving the UC problem.", "You know how some scientists thought that detecting lots of low-amplitude modes in Delta Sct stars was just a matter of having a good signal-to-noise ratio? Well, the space mission CoRoT, developed and operated by CNES, was designed to tap into that treasure trove of data - something that's impossible to do from the ground. \n\nIn this study, we analyzed 140,016 data points from HD 50844 using different approaches and ran several checks. We were able to reach an amplitude spectrum level of 10^{-5} mag in the CoRoT timeseries. When we dug into the frequency analysis, we found hundreds of terms in the 0-30 d^{-1} range. And the best part? All our cross-checks confirmed these new results. \n\nIt turns out that Delta Sct stars really do have a super rich frequency content. We even identified very high-degree modes (up to ell=14) using spectroscopic mode identification, which lends theoretical support to our findings. Plus, we showed that cancellation effects aren't enough to remove the flux variations associated with these modes at the noise level of CoRoT measurements. \n\nGround-based observations revealed that HD 50844 is an evolved star that's slightly lacking in heavy elements, sitting on the Terminal Age Main Sequence. Maybe because of this, we didn't see a clear regular distribution in the frequency set. But we did identify the predominant term (f_1=6.92 d^{-1}) as the fundamental radial mode by combining ground-based photometric and spectroscopic data. \n\nOh, and this work was also made possible by observations from ESO telescopes under the ESO Large Programme LP178.D-0361, as well as data from the Observatorio de Sierra Nevada, the Observatorio Astronomico Nacional San Pedro Martir, and the Piszkesteto Mountain Station of Konkoly Observatory.", "In the giant molecular cloud G174+2.5, we investigated the star-forming regions S231-S235 using various molecular lines. Specifically, we observed quasi-thermal lines of ammonia (NH$_3$) and cyanoacetylene (HC$_3$N), as well as maser lines of methanol (CH$_3$OH) and water vapor (H$_2$O). \n\nTo begin, we selected all massive molecular clumps in G174+2.5 using archived CO data and determined their mass, size, and CO column density. We then performed observations of these clumps, which led to the first detections of NH$_3$ and HC$_3$N lines toward the molecular clumps WB89 673 and WB89 668. This indicates the presence of high-density gas in these regions.\n\nUsing the ammonia emission data, we estimated the physical parameters of the molecular gas in the clumps. Our results show that the gas temperature ranges from 16 to 30 K, while the hydrogen number density falls between 2.8 and 7.2$\\times10^3$ cm$^{-3}$. Notably, we also detected the shock-tracing line of the CH$_3$OH molecule at 36.2 GHz toward WB89 673, a new discovery.", "In a groundbreaking study, we've made the lowest frequency measurements of gamma-ray burst (GRB) 171205A using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT), spanning a frequency range of 250-1450 MHz over 4-937 days. This marks the first-ever detection of a GRB afterglow in the 250-500 MHz frequency range and the second brightest GRB detected with the uGMRT. Despite observing the GRB for nearly 1000 days, we found no signs of transition to a non-relativistic regime. Our analysis of archival Chandra X-ray data from days 70 and 200 revealed no evidence of a jet break. By fitting synchrotron afterglow emission models, we uncovered the nature and density of the circumburst medium, suggesting that the GRB exploded in a stratified wind-like medium. Our findings highlight the importance of low-frequency measurements in understanding the GRB environment. Combining our data with previous studies, we found that the radio afterglow consists of two components: a weak, off-axis jet and a surrounding cocoon, consistent with Izzo et al. (2019). The cocoon emission dominates early on, while the jet takes over later, resulting in flatter radio lightcurves. This research opens new avenues for understanding the complex physics of GRBs.", "Unlock the Power of Quasi-Lie Schemes! \n\nGet ready to revolutionize your approach to Emden-type equations! We've developed a groundbreaking theory of quasi-Lie schemes that's about to take your research to the next level. By harnessing the energy of this innovative framework, we're able to tackle a range of Emden-type equations and their generalizations like never before.\n\nThe results are nothing short of astonishing! We've uncovered time-dependent constants of motion for specific instances of Emden equations, all thanks to the clever application of particular solutions. And the best part? We've recovered previously known results from a fresh, exciting perspective.\n\nBut that's not all! Our quasi-Lie scheme also empowers us to retrieve time-dependent constants of motion for Emden-type equations that meet certain conditions. The possibilities are endless, and we can't wait to see where this new theory takes you!", "We investigate the charged Higgs bosons predicted by the 3-3-1 model with gauge symmetry $SU(3)_c \\otimes SU(3)_L \\otimes U(1)_X$. By considering Yukawa mixing couplings, we show that both hypercharge-one $H_1^{\\pm}$ and hypercharge-two $H_2^{\\pm}$ Higgs bosons can be produced in $pp$ collisions at different rates. At low energy, $H_1^{\\pm}$ behaves like the charged Higgs bosons in a two Higgs doublet model, while $H_2^{\\pm}$ are additional like-charged Higgs bosons unique to the 3-3-1 model. We study pair and associated productions of $H_{1,2}^{\\pm}$ at the LHC, finding that pair production can be comparable to single production due to the exchange of a heavy neutral $Z'$ gauge boson. By analyzing decays to leptons, we identify scenarios where $H_2^{\\pm}$ peaks can be distinguished from the $H_1^{\\pm}$ background in transverse mass distributions.", "Unlocking the Secrets of Isospin Breaking: A Novel Approach to $K_{\\ell 4}$ Form Factors\n\nWe present a groundbreaking framework for understanding isospin breaking in $K_{\\ell 4}$ form factors, driven by the disparity between charged and neutral pion masses. By harnessing the power of suitably subtracted dispersion representations, we construct the $K_{\\ell 4}$ form factors up to two loops in the low-energy expansion, incorporating the fundamental principles of analyticity, crossing, and unitarity.\n\nOur innovative approach yields analytical expressions for the phases of the two-loop form factors in the $K^\\pm\\to\\pi^+\\pi^- e^\\pm \\nu_e$ channel, bridging the gap between experimental measurements of form-factor phase shifts and theoretical studies of $\\pi\\pi$ phase shifts. We uncover the intricate dependence of these phases on the two $S$-wave scattering lengths $a_0^0$ and $a_0^2$ in the isospin limit, going beyond the limitations of previous one-loop chiral perturbation theory analyses.\n\nApplying our methodology to the NA48/2 collaboration's results at the CERN SPS, we reanalyse the phases of the $K^\\pm\\to\\pi^+\\pi^- e^\\pm \\nu_e$ form factors, incorporating crucial isospin-breaking corrections to extract precise values for the scattering lengths $a_0^0$ and $a_0^2$. This breakthrough paves the way for a deeper understanding of the strong nuclear force and its subtle isospin-breaking effects.", "This paper builds upon and expands the findings presented in references [1, 2, 3, and 4], with particular emphasis on reference [4], to derive a statistical characterization of the cosmological constant in a de Sitter cosmological universe in terms of massless excitations exhibiting Planckian effects. Initially, we demonstrate that, at the classical level, a positive cosmological constant (\u039b > 0) can only be attained in the limit as T approaches 0. Analogous to the black hole scenario, when quantum effects are incorporated, a representation of \u039b becomes possible in terms of massless excitations, provided that quantum corrections to the Misner-Sharp mass are taken into account. Furthermore, owing to quantum fluctuations, an effective cosmological constant emerges, dependent on the physical scale under consideration, thereby offering a potential solution to the cosmological constant problem without the introduction of a quintessence field. The diminutive value of the actual cosmological constant (\u039b) may be attributed to the existence of a quantum decoherence scale above the Planck length, such that the spacetime evolves as a pure de Sitter universe with a small, averaged cosmological constant frozen in the lowest energy state.", "We examine the behavior of a one-dimensional spin-glass model with vector spins when there are an infinite number of spin components and the interactions between spins decrease with distance according to a power law. We also study a diluted version of this model, but find that it behaves significantly differently from the fully connected model. At absolute zero temperature, we calculate the energy of defects by comparing the energies of systems with periodic and antiperiodic boundaries, which allows us to determine how the defect energy exponent \u03b8 depends on the power law exponent \u03c3. We find that \u03b8 is well-described by the equation \u03b8 = 3/4 - \u03c3, which implies that the maximum value of \u03c3 is 3/4, corresponding to the lower critical dimension of the model in higher dimensions. At finite temperatures, we solve the model's equations self-consistently to obtain the correlation function, order parameter, and spin-glass susceptibility. We pay particular attention to how the model's behavior changes when the power law exponent \u03c3 is below or above the critical value of 5/8, which corresponds to the upper critical dimension of the model in higher dimensions.", "Stars known as Of^+ supergiants exhibit characteristics that fall between those of regular O-stars and Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Research has shown that these transitional stars share many similarities with WN-type objects, particularly in the visible and near-infrared light ranges, indicating they have similar stellar wind properties. \n\nIn this study, we conducted the first in-depth X-ray observations of two Of^+ supergiants, HD16691 and HD14947. Our findings revealed a soft thermal X-ray spectrum, consistent with what's expected from a single O-type star. However, the X-ray luminosity of these stars was slightly lower than expected for single O-type stars. This suggests that the unique properties of their stellar wind also play a significant role in their X-ray emission as they transition towards becoming WN-type stars.\n\nWe believe that the lower X-ray luminosity of HD16691 and HD14947 may be a sign of the intermediate stage between O and WR stars, caused by an increase in wind density. This discovery provides new insights into the properties of these rare and fascinating stars.", "The AARTFAAC project is developing an All-Sky Monitor (ASM) using the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) telescope. This innovative system will enable continuous, real-time monitoring of low-frequency radio transients across most of the sky visible to LOFAR, with timescales ranging from milliseconds to several days. When a potential transient is detected, the system will rapidly trigger follow-up observations using the full LOFAR telescope.\n\nHowever, achieving these goals poses several significant implementation challenges. These include imaging the entire sky, processing data quickly, and ensuring continuous and autonomous operation of the ASM. In fact, the correlator for the ASM will be the largest in the world in terms of input channels, generating approximately 150,000 correlations per second per spectral channel.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, we conducted test observations using existing LOFAR infrastructure to quantify and refine crucial design criteria for the ASM. This paper provides an overview of the AARTFAAC data processing pipeline and highlights some of the challenges we faced. We also present all-sky images obtained from one of the test observations, which provide valuable insights into the instrument's capabilities.", "Revolutionizing our understanding of cosmic explosions, Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are revealed as the evolved descendants of massive O-type stars and prime candidates to trigger Type Ib/c core-collapse supernovae (SNe). Our groundbreaking HST/WFC3 survey of WR stars in M101 exposes a shocking truth: a staggering 42% of WR stars, soaring to 85% in central regions, are invisible to broad-band detection methods, only revealing themselves through narrow-band optical imaging. This discovery shatters the long-held assumption that the absence of a WR star in broad-band imaging is conclusive evidence against a WR progenitor channel for Type Ib/c SNe, forcing a major rethink in the field."]
