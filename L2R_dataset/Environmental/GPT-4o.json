This bond covers the upfront costs for forest restoration aimed at reducing wildfire severity in Northern California and gives returns from the multiple agencies that benefit from this work.\n\nOn top of that, the Insurance Group set up a fund with an initial $25 million to back projects focused on reducing excess forest fuels and overgrowth and turning it into usable energy, biochar, and building products. This hits three big goals: helping the environment, creating jobs in rural areas, and producing sustainable products.\n\nThey also kicked in about $35 million to a fund for building and leasing advanced greenhouses for growing fresh fruits and veggies.

The uncertainty of future costs, impacts, and needs\u2014alongside the risks associated with climate change, whether related to underwriting or other factors\u2014highlights the importance of maintaining robust surplus levels. Maintaining these levels ensures our capability to meet the needs of our members.", "The procedure consists of four interconnected components. During the risk assessment phase, each risk is evaluated based on its financial impact on Cambia. If a climate risk is identified, our existing process allows us to determine the extent of its impact on Cambia. From a financial liquidity standpoint, we do not conduct direct tests or take specific measures related to climate change. Similarly, we do not model or assess the adequacy of our surplus and liquidity in response to increased utilization of healthcare services. Instead, we aim to ensure that we maintain sufficient layers of liquidity to meet any potential demands.", "A crucial element of our risk culture and governance, as highlighted in our ERM program, involves daily meetings conducted by the Executive Management team. Climate change risks and strategies are discussed in this setting. When necessary, these concerns are escalated to the Board of Directors during their quarterly meetings. The Company\u2019s overall policy on risk management, which inherently includes climate change risks, is to uphold suitable risk mitigation practices such as reinsurance coverage, computer modeling, and diversification. Our greatest risk stems from the concentration of business in the Northeastern US, which we manage by monitoring annual changes in PML models and purchasing appropriate levels of property catastrophe coverage. Furthermore, diversification within our reinsurance portfolio helps distribute risk while retaining a portion of the reinsurance market. Regarding our investment portfolio, we maintain a long-duration, diversified, and financially stable profile. The Company is authorized to use the AMBest BCAR Capital Adequacy Software, which allows us to conduct stress test scenarios and assess impacts on our surplus.

The company operates nationwide, and although insureds in low-lying coastal areas may be affected by rising water levels, these changes are not seen as a substantial risk to the company.", "Meadowbrook incorporates catastrophe modeling in its property underwriting. To assess hurricane risks conservatively, Meadowbrook uses event sets that assume higher than normal sea surface temperatures. These event sets generate higher risk estimates compared to historical event sets. However, the financial impact is expected to be manageable in the short run, as storm activity is already considered in the property catastrophe modeling and insurance pricing.\n\nClimate change may increase the demand for property insurance coverage. Fortunately, Meadowbrook's property catastrophe reinsurance agreements help minimize the financial impact. However, climate change could also raise the cost of catastrophe reinsurance and reinstatement premiums. The most significant threat from climate change is sea-level rise, which would escalate the risk of coastal flooding due to tropical cyclones, extra-tropical cyclones, and tsunamis. It's important to note that Meadowbrook writes very little flood coverage.", "RGA anticipates that climate change risks will influence every dimension of its risk taxonomy.

During this process, risks are prioritized based on their likelihood and impact, both financial and non-financial, and aggregated into a comprehensive corporate risk profile.\n\n**Role of the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Team**\n\nThe ERM team collaborates with the risk network to identify emerging risks, such as strategic, reputational, and competitive risks, including those related to climate change. Members of this network reach out to their respective areas to enumerate key risks from their perspectives. This evolving process is designed to enhance our understanding of organizational risk exposure.\n\n**Contribution of CSR**\n\nCSR plays a vital role by providing essential information regarding climate change risks and opportunities. The CSR team obtains this information through regular engagement with consultants, industry associations, and a senior-level internal committee. These discussions focus on market developments and trends related to climate change, evaluating their potential impacts and opportunities for our company.\n\n**Asset-Level Risk Consideration**\n\nWe assess climate change risks at both the physical asset and investment levels. For physical assets, we evaluate sites with a higher likelihood of severe weather impact. From an investment standpoint, our third-party asset managers are required to integrate Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors, including climate-related risks, into their decision-making processes. For internally managed investments in mortgages and real estate, we incorporate ESG and climate change factors during the investment management process. Environmental assessments are conducted on all real estate securing our mortgage loans, and we strategically invest in renewable energy companies and projects.\n\n**Risk Reporting and Management**\n\nIdentified risks are reported to our Sustainability Advisory Group, which includes senior executives from all business units and functions. Depending on the discussions and feedback from this group, the CSR team might continue further evaluation and planning outside of the meeting, involving pertinent teams such as facilities, investment, product, or other relevant functions.

This escalation could lead to augmented losses for residential and commercial property as well as auto coverages.\n  \n- In non-coastal regions, the risk associated with climate change includes increased frequency and severity of convective storms, such as wind, hail, and tornadoes. These events could similarly elevate losses for residential and commercial property and auto coverages.\n\nThese factors could result in significant loss escalations for REPUBLIC policies across a broad spectrum of areas in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Mississippi, New Mexico, and Louisiana.\n\nAdditionally, the cost and availability of reinsurance may be adversely affected, becoming more expensive and scarce if weather events continue to grow in frequency and intensity.

Additionally, it can amplify the occurrence of tornadoes in the Midwest.\n\nTo address these challenges, the Tokio Marine Group has established comprehensive business continuity plans that undergo regular updates and rigorous testing. Nonetheless, the financial performance of the companies could suffer if climate change leads to a higher frequency of catastrophe events, resulting in widespread property and casualty losses.

Climate change has the potential to increase both the frequency and severity of these events, thereby complicating the determination of premium rates, the establishment of adequate reserves, and the arrangement of appropriate reinsurance.\n\nThe rising frequency and severity of North Atlantic hurricanes, with their devastating impact on coastal areas, are particularly concerning. Hurricanes are responsible for approximately 70% of all wind-related losses in North America.

The Tokio Marine Group has thorough business continuity plans that are regularly updated and tested. \n\nThe financial performance of these companies could suffer if climate change leads to more catastrophic events, causing widespread property and casualty losses. As insurers of property and casualties operating nationwide, the Tokio Marine Group's clients face various weather hazards, including hurricanes, wildfires, flooding, and severe storms.

Hurricanes are responsible for about 70% of all wind-related losses in North America. Moreover, coastal storms, including hurricanes, tropical and sub-tropical storms, and Nor\u2019easters, affect areas from Texas to Maine.
