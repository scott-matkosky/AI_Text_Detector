If that happens, we'll handle it by following our usual careful and responsible business practices.", "We use recognized catastrophic modeling resources, which are sufficient for our commercial insurance business with minimal exposure to concentrated property risk.", "In 2016, the Insurance Group made a commitment to divest from thermal coal investments, and since then, it has not held any thermal coal investments. \n\nThe Insurance Group also actively explores investment opportunities approved by the California Organized Investment Network (COIN), a partnership with the California Department of Insurance that promotes investments with positive climate and social impacts in California. \n\nOne notable example is the Insurance Group's investment in a Forest Resilience Bond, which funds forest restoration work in Northern California to reduce the severity of wildfires. This innovative approach generates returns for investors from multiple agencies that benefit from the mitigation work. \n\nFurthermore, the Insurance Group established a $25 million fund to invest in projects that reduce excess fuels and overgrowth in forests, converting them into usable energy, biochar, and building products. This initiative achieves a triple bottom line by improving the environment, creating jobs in rural communities, and producing sustainable commodities. \n\nAdditionally, the Insurance Group invested $35 million in a fund to build and lease advanced greenhouses for growing fresh fruits and vegetables. These greenhouses will meet growing consumer demand for fresh produce while promoting more sustainable farming practices.", "Our investment strategy at The Insurance Group is designed to strike a balance between competing objectives, ensuring we can meet our liabilities while delivering optimal returns and income for our policyholders at an acceptable level of risk.

Our reinsurance policy and analysis also take into account global risk factors associated with climate change that could affect our financial performance. In response to the California Insurance Commissioner's request, we voluntarily divested from thermal coal investments in 2016 and no longer hold any such investments. More recently, we partnered with a select group of private financiers to invest in a innovative Forest Resilience Bond, which supports forest restoration efforts while generating returns from multiple beneficiary agencies.", "As a collective of vehicle and property insurance providers, the cumulative portfolio of the Insurance Group has consistently been vulnerable to environmental or atmospheric-related damages of a potentially shifting or disastrous nature. As a consequence, our policy offerings, risk assessment, pricing, and reinsurance, among other considerations, have always been crafted with meticulous attention to the potential recurrence and intensity of extensive and multiple damages caused by environmental or atmospheric fluctuations, and trends in damages are analyzed and monitored to inform ongoing decision-making regarding those factors.\n\nMore recently, the prolonged dry spell in California, exacerbated by environmental change, has subjected California woodlands and grasslands to immense strain and elevated risk of wildfires. In 2017, we obtained regulatory approval to utilize Fireline, a product developed by ISO to measure wildfire exposure for rating and underwriting purposes. This will both minimize our risk in wildfire-prone territories and ensure adequate pricing.\n\nThe Insurance Group has dedicated management for catastrophic exposure, and is continually reassessing its catastrophe business strategies in light of available data and technology.
