Meadows argued that only by emulating this system, by prioritizing talent and achievement over patronage and privilege, could Britain hope to achieve similar stability and success. \n\nHowever, this admiration for the Chinese model wasn't universally shared.  During an 1854 parliamentary debate, as recounted by historian Stephen Coolican, John Browne offered a more critical perspective. Browne contended that the Chinese system, while seemingly meritocratic, had become stifled by its own rigid emphasis on \"elegant writing.\"  He argued that this obsession with form over substance had crippled China's civil service, hindering its ability to innovate and adapt, ultimately contributing to its decline relative to the West. \n\n\n", "Beyond safeguarding the health of a nation, the dedicated men and women of the United States Public Health Service (PHS) also answer a higher calling \u2013  to protect and improve global health.
