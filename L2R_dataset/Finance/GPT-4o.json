These are called derivatives because their value depends on the price of other assets, whether financial or real. Other examples of derivatives include call options and put options. Some fixed income assets, like callable bonds and puttable bonds, also mimic the behavior of derivatives.\n\nA futures contract is an agreement between two parties. One party agrees to deliver an underlying asset to the other party on a specified expiration date, in exchange for the agreed-upon futures price. The other party agrees to pay the futures price in exchange for receiving the asset. Neither party has to pay anything upfront to enter into the agreement.\n\nIn the terminology of futures contracts, the party committing to receive the asset is said to have \"bought\" the contract, while the party committing to deliver the asset is said to have \"sold\" the contract.\n\nTo illustrate, if you buy a futures contract on June 1 at a futures price of $100, with a maturity date of August 1, you are committing to pay $100 for the underlying asset on August 1. There is no upfront payment required. The futures price is simply the agreed-upon price at which the asset will change hands.", "Absolutely!

Often, it's significantly higher. This is because the stock price reflects both the NAV and investors' future expectations.

This shift allows them to avoid the risks associated with fluctuations in the US Dollar's value. Given that the Chinese Yuan has been generally appreciating, agreeing to receive payments in USD while their expenses are in CNY often results in financial losses for them. Consequently, they need to pad their prices to account for this volatility. Meanwhile, Canadian importers would need to purchase Chinese Yuan (usually with Canadian Dollars, CAD) to pay for their orders. Canadian exporters, on the other hand, can choose to accept payments in Chinese Yuan or set their prices in Canadian Dollars. By eliminating the US Dollar as an intermediary, these transactions become less risky and involve lower costs.\n\nJapan adopted a similar approach several decades ago when they, too, used to price their products in USD. This adjustment is particularly significant in transactions involving large amounts, though it is less critical for smaller transactions, such as those related to tourism.

They mention something being \"only available to members of the Florida Bar,\" which doesn't add up. Are they in a Florida state court, a federal court, or an IP/administrative setting?

For instance, they mention needing an attorney for Trademark/IP courts, which implies patent prosecution\u2014typically about obtaining patents, not litigation afterward. However, I'm not an expert in this area, so I could be wrong. \n\nThe issue is that their story is too vague, forcing me to speculate. Patent litigation, such as for infringement, usually occurs in traditional district courts, and to my knowledge, does not require a special trademark/IP exam to file a lawsuit. Conversely, patent prosecution requires the attorney to pass the USPTO exam to become a patent attorney (more info here: [USPTO Registration Examination](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USPTO_registration_examination)). \n\nFederal courts generally use PACER ECF/CM for case management, which is likely the system they are referencing.

It is often recommended to shift from a high-growth option to a balanced option approximately 10-15 years before retirement, and then to a capital-guaranteed option a few years prior to retirement. This passive approach has its pros and cons. \n\nThe main advantage is its simplicity: you only need to adjust your investment strategy based on your life stage two to three times during your lifetime. This allows you to take more risks and potentially achieve higher returns when you are young, adopt a balanced approach with moderate risk and returns in mid-life, and minimize risk for stable returns in later years.\n\nHowever, a potential downside is that you might be in a high-risk/high-growth option during a market downturn and switch to a balanced option just as the market starts to recover. This could result in significant losses during the market decline, and you might miss out on the subsequent gains when the market rebounds.\n\nAn alternative, more active approach involves tracking the market and adjusting your investment strategy accordingly. For example, you could monitor the ASX200 index (if your investments are primarily in the Australian stock market) using a 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). If the index crosses above the 200-day SMA, the market is considered bullish, whereas crossing below indicates a bearish trend. This method works well during upward or downward trends but can lead to frequent changes during sideways markets, which might not be ideal.\n\nA more suitable option might be a hybrid approach: use the passive strategy to adjust from aggressive to balanced to capital-guaranteed based on life stages, but apply the active strategy to time these changes. For instance, if you are in your late 40s and plan to switch from an aggressive to a balanced option soon, you could wait until the ASX200 crosses below the 200-day SMA before making the switch. This way, you can capitalize on the bulk of the uptrend before transitioning.\n\nIf you seek greater control over your superannuation assets, you might consider starting a Self-Managed Super Fund (SMSF). However, it is advisable to have at least $300K to $400K in assets before doing so, as the annual costs might otherwise be too high as a percentage of your total super assets.", "Did you know that investors aren't always protected from lawsuits? \n\nWell, not in the way you might think.

However, in that scenario, my contract wouldn't be with them, would it?\n\nNow, consider this: if the company you work for goes under, sure, you can sue them. But if they\u2019re broke, what are you really going to gain? Interestingly, if it\u2019s a corporation, the registered owners can also be held liable for the company's debts.

The primary advantage of a 401k is that you can contribute money without paying income tax on it upfront, and you won't be subject to capital gains taxes on the account's growth. However, there are important restrictions: you can't freely add or withdraw money, and withdrawals are taxed, with significant penalties if withdrawn before age 65. \n\nThese kinds of restrictions apply to all retirement accounts offering tax benefits. Now, regarding the $7,000 not seeming like a benefit\u2014consider this: even with a modest 4% annual growth rate, over 40 years, that initial $7,000 can grow to $34,671.

For a 401(k) with high expenses, I would only contribute up to the employer match and ensure that I fully take advantage of the available match. In such instances, having an additional $3,000 on hand might be beneficial, especially if you are starting with a constrained budget. \n\nConversely, for a low-cost 401(k) with an employer match, it is advisable to contribute as much as you can afford. Similarly, for a Roth 401(k) with an employer match, the same expense considerations apply. It is particularly advantageous to utilize a Roth 401(k) when beginning your contributions or if you are in a lower tax bracket. Having a combination of both traditional and Roth accounts is prudent.\n\nIt is important to note that contributing to a Roth now is without risk, regarding the account itself, although not necessarily the investments within it. Should you decide in the following year that the Roth is not suitable, you can withdraw your initial contribution without penalty or tax. In response to the updated query, there are two components to consider regarding Roth deposits: the initial contribution, which allows $3,000 of earned income to be placed in a tax-sheltered account, and the subsequent investment decision. These steps are sequential, and you can deliberate between them carefully.\n\nRegarding the timing of dividends, in an IRA or 401(k), dividends are not taxed, rendering the timing irrelevant in this context.

A person who buys a $500k home in a high property tax area benefits twice: first, by receiving more tax breaks than the average working-class individual who buys a $250k house, and second, by enjoying better schools and public services funded by others. San Francisco's home prices are driven by speculative investment and inadequate government regulation. The city's prices are comparable to Tokyo's, despite having only one-tenth the population density, reflecting local government policy failures to build more homes, not a lack of tax breaks. If your community chooses to pay higher taxes for better local services, more power to you, but you shouldn't be subsidized by those who don't.

However, this perspective has two major flaws. First, the US government isn't directly involved in the transaction. It's the recipient's bank that credits the account. Second, if these digits are deemed intangible and hence valueless, they neither increase nor decrease in worth.\n\nIn reality, the government\u2019s role in such transfers is purely supervisory. The sending bank debits the sender\u2019s account, while the receiving bank credits the recipient\u2019s account. All intermediaries profit from the transaction because the sender's cost is higher than the recipient\u2019s credit. The sending bank typically gains a credit in their correspondent bank's account, while the receiving bank incurs a debit.\n\nShould a bank frequently send money, its correspondent bank's account balance may deplete. Conversely, a bank that regularly receives funds will accumulate a surplus. Domestic payments, often facilitated by governmental or quasi-governmental agencies, manage this imbalance. In the US, banks adjust balances via accounts with the Federal Reserve.\n\nInternationally, correspondent banks handle these transactions.

Not all Nordic countries have oil, so your perception is biased.", "I used to work for one of the big three ratings agencies a while back. Let me give you an inside look! First of all, there are numerous types of ratings, primarily focused on corporate debt and public finance. Think senior debentures for fixed income and General Obligations like tax-free municipal bonds. Contrary to popular belief, ratings agencies aren't paid by investment banks but by the corporations or cities/states issuing the debt. Investment banks, meanwhile, are the masterminds pulling transactions together and bringing them to market.\n\nNow, when it comes to mortgage-backed securities and complex structured products like collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), it's a different ball game. Here, you do see some unsettlingly close ties between investment bankers and ratings agencies, and these were the transactions that sparked major problems. Despite this, ratings agencies generally did well in their traditional domains, focusing on corporate and municipal bonds.\n\nInterestingly, S&P's fee model shifted about 50 years ago when McGraw-Hill bought them in 1966; before that, their fees were paid by investors who were purchasing the bonds. Whether McGraw-Hill initiated this change remains unclear. But not all credit ratings agencies operate this way; take Egan-Jones, for example. Unlike S&P, Fitch, and Moody's, Egan-Jones gets its revenue from investors, the folks buying the bonds. This model gives me a glimmer of hope that we don't have to be completely disheartened by the system.\n\nAs user xcrunna19 rightly pointed out, Nouriel Roubini, a well-regarded professor, suggests that change might require government intervention. While this seems probable, I'd prefer if ratings agencies independently adopted less conflicted payment models. Complicating matters, many Dodd-Frank provisions have removed existing regulatory requirements for credit ratings on bonds and other securities. Here's the kicker: there's currently nothing to replace these ratings agencies. We're awaiting a government-devised alternative, but until then, which is worse: having no ratings at all or relying on occasionally inflated ones that give a false sense of security?

Other sources suggest the beta for KORS is around -0.01 or close to zero. Using a beta of -0.01, I calculated a WACC of 2.2%, which seems more reasonable.

If you take out a loan and close your credit cards, your credit score will be negatively impacted because your leverage ratio will spike to 100% or more. Additionally, you'll reduce the average age of your credit lines (replacing several long-standing lines with a single, new one). \n\nOn the other hand, if you take out the loan but keep your accounts open, you'll have an additional line of credit. This will increase your total available credit and lower your leverage ratio. However, lenders may become more hesitant to extend you further credit until they can see how you manage your current obligations.\n\nIn either scenario, if you can secure a loan with an interest rate lower than the average rate on your credit cards (which isn't guaranteed, as some lenders may offer APRs in the 20% to 30% range even for secured loans), your overall cost of borrowing will decrease. This reduction in cost frees up more discretionary income, which you can then use to strategically \"snowball\" your debt, as you mentioned.\n\nFinally, remember that your minimum payment requirement will vary with your balance and interest rate, which are typically variable.

Factors beyond your knowledge could impact the entire industry. If you work in the industry you\u2019re investing in, adverse situations like salary freezes, loss of bonuses, or job termination may force you to liquidate your investments, as many ESPP advisory notes suggest. Moreover, having insider knowledge might necessitate proving that any investment position was taken without such insights.\n\nOn the other hand, diversifying your investments can help reduce volatility. For instance, a rise in oil prices might harm the airline industry but benefit the oil sector, thereby balancing your overall investment growth. Allocating a part of your portfolio to specific industries may be pragmatic, yet beginners might struggle to outperform the market due to behavioral biases or market efficiency, which often already accounts for available information.\n\nPlease note, I am new to this field and my insights are primarily based on what I\u2019ve read, not personal experience.

Conversely, many also fail to achieve even the market rate of return. Typically, those who succeed do so by taking risks, which also increases the likelihood of failure.

You can choose cash dividends or reinvest them in more shares. For stock growth, consider Dividend Reinvestment Plans (DRIPs).", "When you want to short a stock, you're attempting to sell shares that you borrow from your broker, so you need buyers for those shares. The ask prices represent sellers, while the bid prices represent buyers. For example, you could place a limit order to short (sell) 1,000 shares at $3.01, which would set the ask price at $3.01. If there is an existing ask price for 500 shares at $3.00, those shares must be bought before anyone can buy your 1,000 shares at $3.01. However, your order might not be filled if buyers don't purchase all the shares ahead of you, and the price could drop to $1.00 without reaching $3.01, causing you to miss the trade.\n\nIf you definitely want to short 1,000 shares, you could use a market order. For instance, if there\u2019s a bid for 750 shares at $2.50 and another bid for 250 shares at $2.49, a market order to sell 1,000 shares would fill first at $2.50 for 750 shares, then at $2.49 for 250 shares. In reality, bid-ask spreads are usually narrower. A stock might have a bid price of $10.50 and an ask price of $10.51, just a 1 cent difference. Thus, placing a limit order at $10.51 or using a market order to sell at $10.50 would yield similar results.\n\nAdditionally, brokers generally don't allow shorting stocks trading under $5 per share. Short sales can sometimes be prevented if a stock is heavily shorted and the broker cannot find shares to borrow. Remember, short selling is only allowed with a margin account, not a cash account.", "Challenging the remark on your credit report is unlikely to alter your score significantly, as it is merely a comment. It's uncertain whether scoring models can read and incorporate these remarks into the actual score. However, disputing a revolving account that should be marked as closed is another issue entirely.

The main difference is that Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax money, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. In contrast, Traditional IRA contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxable.

Once you have the payment schedule, you can apply your payments ($100). Ensure that interest accrues if your $100 does not cover the monthly payment, or apply any excess towards the principal if it exceeds the payment amount. The outstanding principal will be the remaining balance.\n\nUsing software like GnuCash or Quicken can simplify creating the payment schedule and managing the payments. If you\u2019re using a spreadsheet, you\u2019ll need to detail 36 lines (for 3 years x 12 months) of payments and recalculations, but this shouldn't be too much work.

Make sure to cover all your bills and expenses. When it comes to debts, only pay the minimum required on each. After budgeting, any remaining money is considered 'extra.' Use this 'extra' to prioritize the following steps:\n\n1. Build an emergency fund that covers 3-6 months of living expenses, adjusting according to your comfort level. \n2. Once your emergency fund is established, contribute enough to your 401k to take full advantage of any employer matching.\n3. Use the snowball method to pay off your debts, starting with the smallest. Allocate the 'extra' towards this debt, and as each debt is paid off, the amount you can put towards the next one grows larger, creating a snowball effect. If you have small credit card debts, this applies to them as well.\n\nOnce all your debts are eliminated, treat yourself within reason, but avoid incurring new debt. Shift your 'extra' funds into maximizing your retirement savings. Consult a financial advisor to help you balance contributions between pre-tax and post-tax retirement accounts. They can also guide you in maximizing your tax-advantaged retirement accounts, which will be a significant milestone.\n\nAny remaining funds after maximizing retirement savings can be used as you wish. If you choose to focus on wealth building, it can lead to financial independence. Look into FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) for advice on frugal living and wealth-building strategies.

Secured debt is backed by an asset, such as a mortgage on your house. This type of debt is often referred to as \"good\" debt because the asset can be sold to repay the loan if necessary. However, it's crucial to remember that the value of the asset can decrease, turning your \"good\" debt into \"bad\" debt. For example, homes and cars can lose value, which may leave you with debt that exceeds the asset's worth, making the debt no longer secured.\n\nOn the other hand, unsecured debt is not backed by any asset, and repayment relies solely on your income. Credit card debt is a common example, where purchases can't easily be resold to cover the debt. This type of debt is often seen as \"bad\" debt because it lacks any collateral to offset the risk.\n\nIt\u2019s important to be cautious of the terms \"good\" and \"bad\" debt, as these labels can be misleading. They might lead you to underestimate the risks associated with having debt, fostering a false sense of security about your financial situation. For instance, the belief in the \"good\" debt myth has led many to borrow more than their home value, contributing to the foreclosure crisis when they couldn't meet their repayment obligations.\n\nSound financial advice suggests borrowing only for essential needs like a house, education, and possibly a car, with a preference for modest purchases within your means. For example, instead of splurging on a luxury vehicle, opt for basic transportation. Keep your house payment below one-fourth of your take-home pay, and strive to pay off educational loans as quickly as possible.\n\nIn summary, regardless of the type\u2014secured or unsecured, \"good\" or \"bad\"\u2014less debt is generally better than more debt. It's important to recognize that even too much of what is considered \"good\" debt can become a financial burden.", "I'm not a lawyer, but a crucial point to think about is how you'd divide the money if one of you chooses to close the account or at least their share of it.

Freehold means you own the property outright. In contrast, leasehold indicates a rental arrangement. However, the real world often presents more nuanced scenarios. For instance, as Peter K. mentioned, you might buy a building and the business within it, yet the land it sits on could be leased from a different owner. \n\nSometimes, you encounter businesses like pubs marketed as either freehold or leasehold. This could mean you're purchasing just the pub business\u2014complete with its brand, decor, and partnerships\u2014but the building housing the pub remains under a lease from another property owner.

If that were the case, the management probably wouldn't view the UK branch as being on solid ground. However, the article argues that the losses aren't just from market expansion. In fact, Starbucks in the UK is healthy and profitable. The real issue is that their debt appears inflated by borrowing from abroad\u2014debt unrelated to their UK operations and expansion\u2014which conveniently lowers their tax rate.\n\nThis kind of financial maneuvering is a luxury only large multinationals can afford.

Here is a more formal version of the text:\n\nIndeed, it involves a certain degree of risk. To put this into perspective, an analysis of S&P 500 returns since 1871 reveals a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 10.72%, accompanied by a Standard Deviation (SDev) of 18.67%. Consequently, 53 out of the 146 years yielded returns of less than 4%. \n\nWhen this analysis is performed over rolling eight-year periods, the CAGR decreases to 9.22%, while the SDev falls to 5.74%. This results in only 31 out of 139 periods producing returns below 4%. Conversely, 26 periods achieved eight-year returns exceeding a 15% CAGR. From the anti-DS article you referenced, I note your appreciation for a good analogy. To me, the long-term returns of the S&P 500 can be likened to gambling in Las Vegas, wherein the expected return for craps (a dice game) is 10%. Although losses can occur on any given roll, over a larger series of rolls, the expected return significantly favors the player. \n\nAddressing Mr. Stanley's observation - I concur that returns are not perfectly normally distributed, but they are not substantially deviant either. Among the 139 rolling returns, we would anticipate approximately 68%, or 95 results, to fall within one standard deviation. The actual data shows 88 results within \u00b11 SDev. For two standard deviations, one would expect only 5% to fall outside this range. In the actual findings, only one result is on the low side and four on the high side, amounting to five results as opposed to the expected seven. The outcomes suggest a somewhat more profitable scenario than would be indicated by a normal bell curve distribution.", "If I buy VUSA from one exchange, can I sell it on a different exchange, assuming my brokerage account lets me trade on both?

I asked Selftrade about VUSA, and they said I can only trade it in the same currency and on the same exchange where I bought it. Most brokers probably have the same rule for regular folks, but banks or millionaires might have different options.\n\nVUSA is listed in GBP on the LSE and in EUR on the AEX, and it was created by an Irish company with an Irish ISIN.

He advised against investing in currencies, focusing instead on bonds and stocks, and recommended stocks only for intelligent speculation. Graham passed away a few years after Nixon ended the gold standard by closing the gold window. \n\nToday, gold can still be considered a form of currency, as it is used by endowments and other investors as a store of value and for risk diversification. However, investing in currencies or commodities does not align with Graham's principles. Accurately estimating the intrinsic value of a currency or commodity to achieve a Graham-like margin of safety, where the intrinsic value significantly exceeds the market value, is challenging. \n\nClaims that gold is \"clearly underpriced in today's market\" lack substantiation. Graham's approach, such as the \"net-net\" method\u2014which values stocks based on their current tangible assets minus all liabilities\u2014is grounded in quantitative analysis of audited accounting numbers, providing a genuine margin of safety.", "Many partnership agreements feature a shotgun clause: one party sets a price, and the other can either buy at that price or sell to the initiator.

However, the situation doesn't compel you to pay more than you believe the company's half is worth.\n\nWithout a formal partnership agreement in place, navigating forward is challenging. One tactic is to act as though a shotgun clause exists. Ask him if he thinks the company's half is worth $X, and if he's prepared to purchase your share at that same price and let his wife manage the business without you.

Even if I wanted to abandon my American citizenship and move to Somalia, I would still be required to pay taxes. If leaving were entirely free, you might have a point that by not leaving, we're choosing to stay. But that\u2019s far from reality.

However, if you're the owner and you provide a loan to the company, it might be beneficial if you want to earn interest, especially if other partners aren't lending money. A loan enables you to receive interest payments, which are taxable income (reported on a 1099-INT form), but the company can deduct the interest as an expense. On the other hand, making a capital contribution is simpler and allows you to take distributions later to recover your investment without any tax implications, though you won't receive interest.", "The TWRR calculation still works even when dealing with negative values. Consider this formula: TWRR = (1 + 0.10) x (1 + (-0.191)) x (1 + 0.29) ^ (1/3) = 1.047, which translates to a 4.7% return. Now, regarding your concern with the -19% return for the second quarter, you might think this is \"way off,\" but in reality, it's not. \n\nThe TWRR measures the return by factoring in any cash added or withdrawn from the account. For instance, if I start with $100,000, add $10,000, and end up with $110,000, the return on my investment is 0% because the balance increase is solely from the additional cash. Conversely, if I start with $100,000, add $10,000, and end up with $100,000, it's a negative return since I've essentially lost the $10,000 I put in.\n\nIn your case, you started the second quarter with $15,000, deposited $4,000, and ended with $15,750. This means you lost nearly all of the $4,000 you deposited, which is indeed a significant loss.", "Your tax bracket is 25%, but this doesn't mean you'll take home 75% of your salary. There are several factors affecting your take-home pay. First, there are payroll taxes, usually labeled \"FICA\" on your pay stub. This includes a 6.2% Social Security tax on the first $118,500 of your income and a 1.45% Medicare tax on the first $200,000. Note that your employer also contributes additional taxes not shown on your stub, so 7.65% of your salary is immediately deducted.\n\nIn addition to federal income tax, your paycheck might also have state income taxes deducted, which vary by state. Importantly, being in the 25% tax bracket doesn't mean you pay 25% on your entire salary. You pay different rates on portions of your income: 10%, 15%, and then 25% on the remaining amount.\n\nThe federal income tax withheld from your paycheck is an estimate of your total tax liability. Various factors, such as personal exemptions, deductions, and credits, can decrease your overall tax bill, while investment income and penalties can increase it.

Once a Fortune 500 titan, Schlitz decided to cut corners in the 70s to boost its profit margins. They sped up the fermentation process, switched to using corn syrup instead of malt, and used hop pellets rather than fresh hops. To make up for the loss in quality, they added unusual additives, which sometimes turned the beer to the consistency of \"snot.\" While the short-term profits soared, loyal customers soon abandoned the brand.\n\nFor a more contemporary perspective, consider these companies from the 2012 Fortune 500 list:\n\n- **Morgan Stanley**: Involved in the global economic crash, they sold financial products to customers while secretly betting against them.\n- **Bank of America**: They doubled interest rates on customers in good standing and introduced fees for everything, including speaking to a teller.\n- **General Motors**: They've cheapened their car interiors, now made mostly of plastic.\n\nThese modern-day examples emphasize that the temptation to sacrifice quality for profit is still very real.", "The company likely wants to pay you for a product via a purchase order rather than as a contractor.

The future of retail still includes brick-and-mortar stores since consumers prefer sensory experiences, such as the ability to touch products. In the future, customers may visit stores to see items but have them delivered to their homes the same day or the next day. This approach allows stores to occupy smaller spaces, as they won't need to carry large inventories; local warehouses will handle that. Stores will function mainly as showrooms to showcase products and possibly serve as locations for customers to pick up or return items.\n\nThe current buzzword is \"experiential.\" Stores need to provide experiences that digital platforms cannot. For example, when I first heard the term \"experiential,\" I thought about the now-closed Sports Authority, which had large spaces filled with items I could easily find at Walmart, Target, or order from Amazon. There was no unique draw. Reflecting on it, those stores had enough square footage to host mini rock climbing gyms or simulation activities for sports like tennis and golf.

But that's not entirely accurate. While it's true they don't lend money, banks charge retailers a significant commission for each transaction, which is pure profit with minimal risk. Congress is considering (or may have already approved) a proposal to cap this commission. This change would turn debit cards into just a service for checking account holders rather than a profit center for banks. For individuals, this is beneficial. \n\nI disagree, though. Debit cards are more convenient than checks, but they offer much less protection compared to credit cards. Here\u2019s what I previously mentioned on this topic, and it seems like the community agrees.\n\nWhy do we need a credit history to buy expensive items? Because the system is flawed. It rewards people in debt by giving them more opportunities to incur even more debt, while those who are debt-free struggle to get credit when they need it. The current system only allows creditors to assess the risk of someone who already has debt; they can't evaluate someone with no debt history. To me, this entire credit card system seems like a lucrative scheme backed by the government.\n\nHowever, it's not the credit cards themselves but the credit score system that's broken.

The specific combination of these can result in prolonged refund times, in addition to any human delays (as Ben Miller's answer explains). When you make a payment with a credit card, it is generally only authorized - meaning the issuing bank says, \"I'm reserving this money for this transaction,\" but no actual funds transfer occurs yet. This is usually visible as a \"pending\" charge on your statement. Only later, through a process called \"settlement,\" does your bank transfer the money to the merchant's bank. This process usually starts at the end of the business day when the authorization happens, but it might take a few days to complete. For ecommerce transactions, the merchant may not be allowed to initiate the process until they ship your order. Conversely, a transaction can either be voided or refunded. In the first case, the transaction simply disappears; in the second case, it might disappear or you might see both the payment and the refund on your statement. Voids can occur as quickly as authorizations, but once a transaction has entered the settlement phase, it can no longer be voided. Refunding money (a \"refund\") goes through the same settlement process and can take just as long. Specifically, in answer to your question: You receive the SMS when the transaction is authorized, even though no funds have been transferred. The refund won\u2019t appear until several days after someone initiates it, and there is no \"reverse authorize\" function to notify you or your bank in advance.", "Before jumping to the conclusion that he should just stay home, imagine living in a single-car household, which is becoming more common as markets rise.

Just keep an eye on how many hard pulls you\u2019ve had in the reporting period.

Remember, all food consists of chemicals\u2014water is a chemical, and even broccoli is packed with various chemicals. When we examine the specific nutritional profiles of meat alternatives, most range from being marginally better to no worse than meat-based foods. Though getting protein from leafy greens, whole grains, nuts, and legumes might be superior, meat alternatives make it easier for people to transition to plant-based diets and see them as viable options. This shift can have a positive health impact or, at the very least, be no worse than an omnivorous diet.\n\nAdditionally, it's important not to ignore the non-health-related reasons people choose these options. Many opt for meat alternatives due to concerns about animal welfare or the environment. Others simply enjoy the taste. Many plant-based meat alternatives offer unique flavors that aren't directly comparable to meat and, in many cases, taste better than similar frozen convenience foods made from animals.", "In a long-term bull market, optimistic investor sentiment pushes prices upward, with participants generally being net buyers over time.

There are still numerous reasons to consider buying long-term bonds, even if yields are low due to the nearly flat term structure of interest rates.

You can switch your IRA to a provider that doesn't impose such fees or convert it to a Roth IRA and merge it with your existing Roth account. Either approach allows you to retain all your funds and save $100 each year going forward. \n\nIf you intend to withdraw funds from your retirement accounts, it\u2019s best to take them from your Roth IRA since you can withdraw your contributions (up to the amount you initially contributed) without incurring taxes or penalties.

This interpretation is accurate. When the payment goes to BigCo, it signifies that BigCo is issuing new shares, not Jack. Therefore, Jack doesn't profit from selling the equity personally; instead, the company raises funds through the share issuance, which it can use for expansion. Over time, the capital gains from this expansion may surpass the value of a $200,000 no-interest loan to the company.\n\nFor example, if BigCo's valuation is $1 million before investing $250,000, then post-investment, its value becomes $1.25 million. Thus, $250,000 represents a 20% stake in the company. BigCo should only offer the buyer a 20% share, not 25%, in this scenario. Providing a 25% share means the buyer receives a $312,500 stake for the $250,000 investment.\n\nConversely, if Jack sells 25% of the company for $250,000 from his personal shares, it doesn't alter the company's assessed value, only Jack's ownership percentage. Jack then lends $200,000 to the company, which doesn't impact the company's assessed value theoretically, as the company gains $200,000 but accrues a $200,000 liability, leaving the net value unchanged. Assets and liabilities remain balanced.\n\nIf the company's valuation is $1 million and the buyer pays $250,000 for a 25% stake at that valuation, it implies that the check is written to Jack. Any other scenario involving the check being payable to BigCo suggests that some figures are off. For instance, the buyer might actually be acquiring a 20% stake, bringing the company's value to $1.25 million post-investment. Alternatively, the buyer could be paying $333,333.33, raising the company's valuation to $1,333,333.33. Another possibility is that BigCo's pre-investment worth might be $750,000, making the post-investment value $1 million. In such a case, Jack might be at a disadvantage, selling $312,500 worth of stock (25%) for just $250,000, resulting in his shares dropping in value from $1 million to $937,500, with the company\u2019s total valuation at $1.25 million. Any of these scenarios or a combination thereof could explain the valuation adjustments.", "It's important to remember that this money belongs to both you and your wife.

It is important to examine the fixed rates over different periods, such as 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year fixed terms.

Conversely, if 3-year fixed rates are also low, this indicates that banks foresee a prolonged economic downturn. Banks will adjust their fixed rates based on their economic outlook to avoid losses.

The closest I've come to machine learning is through cross-validation by walk-forward analysis, which I'll be publishing about on Monday. \n\nI'm not familiar with TensorFlow beyond its use in deep learning and its incompatibility with Windows, which precludes its use on my gaming computer. Currently, I'm not exploring machine learning, although neural networks are on my reading list. There's been discussion on r/algotrading suggesting that deep learning hasn't outperformed traditional ML techniques and might be a fad, which I intend to investigate further.\n\nThank you for enjoying my post and visiting my site!", "\"He likely wanted 13 years of market close data.

With capitalized interest of $436 added, the total principal becomes $5,936. When you begin payments, the monthly payment for a ten-year plan at 6.8% interest on this principal is $68.31. Over 120 payments (one per month for ten years), this totals $8,197.40.", "If your uncle wants life insurance for a shorter specified period, he should consider hybrid life insurance. A hybrid universal life policy offers guaranteed premiums and death benefits up to any chosen age. Traditional permanent policies focus on cash value and can be costly, but hybrid policies combine term and universal life elements, making them more affordable. While not emphasizing cash value, hybrid policies guarantee premiums and death benefits up to a specific age (e.g., 85, 90, 95, 100), allowing customization to fit your budget and family needs. Unlike typical lifetime coverage of universal and whole life policies, hybrids offer reduced premiums with coverage tailored to a specific age. If the policyholder outlives this age, the death benefit decreases, but premiums remain unchanged.", "A 20% estimate is almost certainly too high. I agree with using 2% as a rough guideline, although this can vary significantly depending on the industry. Typically, I calculate an average of the working capital over the previous 2-3 years and deduct that from cash. Working capital is defined as Current Assets minus Current Liabilities. \n\nCurrent Assets include cash, prepaid expenses, and accounts receivable, which means they are likely to be much higher than just cash. This results in more excess cash after liabilities are deducted, thereby reducing the Enterprise Value (EV) and making the EV/EBITDA ratio appear more expensive, as Dimitri noted.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that a balance sheet is just a snapshot of the final day of the quarter. Due to seasonal effects, it's critical to smooth this data by averaging it over several periods. After doing these calculations for a few companies, compare the working capital to revenue. Is it close to 2%?", "LOL. Do you really believe the game is fair, big man? You think it's all about that one brilliant idea that'll make you rich overnight? How about you finish high school, get yourself a real job, and lay the groundwork for your startup. Once you've got some experience under your belt, then we can have this conversation.", "My primary regret is that, much like the comparison between the CFA and MBA, they exclusively hire recent graduates from prestigious institutions with inflated GPAs (Harvard, for instance). These individuals often lack practical knowledge and quickly adopt a superficial lifestyle focused on appearances. I would prefer hiring a level-headed graduate from a state school over these aspiring high-flyers any day.", "Economic hardship can be as misleading as \"economic slavery.\" If you're working two jobs and still can't afford rent, how can you improve your situation? Sure, if you're exceptionally intelligent, charismatic, or possess some outstanding talent, you might find a way out. But if you're putting in 85 (or 60) hours a week and giving it your all, that should be enough.\n\nPersonally, I don't support a $15 minimum wage, whether at a local, state, or federal level. However, I strongly advocate for legislation that allows individuals working 85 (or 60) hours a week\u2014equivalent to 12-hour days for 85 hours per week\u2014to sustain themselves. By \"sustain,\" I mean being able to afford modest housing, nutritious food, decent health insurance, clothing (even second-hand), and saving a little.\n\nMinimum wage jobs are typically held by young people entering the job market and older individuals with limited skills. Legislation should reflect this reality. High school and college students aren't working 60-85+ hours a week, so subsidies should be reserved for those who truly need them.", "Yes, definitely! It's our responsibility to help kids in tough situations, even if their parents make poor choices.

Well, it's a bit tricky since Uber is a privately-held company, meaning you can't just go out and buy its stock directly. But don't worry, there are some workaround methods you could try to get involved.\n\nFirst off, you can invest in companies that have put money into Uber. Think Alphabet/Google (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Toyota (ADR), and a few others. If you think Uber is going to struggle and want to short them instead, you could look into shorting these companies since they\u2019ve got a stake in Uber.\n\nAnother angle is to check out Uber\u2019s competitors. For example, if Uber takes a hit, companies like Lyft might benefit (although, to be fair, Lyft has its own challenges). You could also think outside the box\u2014maybe investing in a traditional taxi company or one that supports taxi services, like Medallion Financial Corporation (MFIN).\n\nJust keep in mind that investing or shorting these companies isn't the same as doing it directly with Uber. You're getting some indirect exposure to Uber\u2019s performance, but it's influenced by a bunch of other factors too.\n\nFor more details, you might want to check out the Investopedia article \"Ways to Invest in Uber before It Goes Public.\" And just so you know, I'm not advising you to actually go out and do any of this!"]
