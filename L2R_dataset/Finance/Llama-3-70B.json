However, some newer controls have been implemented to prevent institutions from misusing them. For instance, under the Dodd-Frank Act (DFA), banks are no longer allowed to solely rely on credit ratings as due diligence when purchasing a financial instrument, which is a positive step. The idea behind this is that if financial institutions do their own thorough research, they may be able to identify a problematic CDO and avoid it.", "You cannot use a health FSA to pay for individual health insurance premiums.

The truth is, Rand's fictional works don't translate well to real life because they're inherently unrealistic. To illustrate this, imagine John Galt and his followers being stripped of everything created by or within the society they despise, and then left in the desert. Without tools, food, or clothing, they would likely perish from exposure and starvation within two weeks. The reason libertarians get away with promoting their flawed ideology as rational is that few people are willing to point out its flaws. Historically, this philosophy was seen as fringe and comparable to extremist groups like the John Birchers, so it was largely ignored. However, with the rise of billionaire-backed politicians, this flawed thinking has become more accepted, albeit only among a select few.", "Futures contracts are a type of financial derivative, a broader class of assets whose value is derived from the price of underlying assets, whether financial or real. Other examples of derivatives include call options and put options, while fixed-income assets that exhibit similar characteristics to derivatives include callable bonds and puttable bonds.\n\nA futures contract is a formal agreement between two parties that outlines the following terms: one party agrees to deliver the underlying asset to the other party on the expiration date in exchange for the predetermined futures price, while the other party agrees to pay the futures price in exchange for the asset. Notably, no upfront payment is required to enter into the contract. The party committing to receive the underlying asset is said to have \"bought\" the contract, while the party committing to deliver the asset is said to have \"sold\" the contract.\n\nTo illustrate, purchasing a futures contract on June 1 with a futures price of $100 and a maturity date of August 1 means that you are committing to pay $100 for the underlying asset on August 1. There is no initial payment required. The futures price simply represents the predetermined value at which the underlying asset will be exchanged.", "Join Scentsy this month and receive a FREE diffuser with your starter kit - a one-time offer!

To illustrate, let's consider a scenario where you're exchanging 100 units of US Dollars to British Pounds, with a current conversion rate of 1 USD = 0.82 GBP. To accurately calculate the exchange rate, you must factor in the 3% deduction, which reduces the actual currency rate to 97%. Therefore, the approximate magnitude of the exchange rate would be 0.82 x 0.97 = 0.7954. This formula provides a reliable estimate, although it may not yield a 100% accurate value. Nevertheless, it serves as a valuable guide for navigating currency conversions on PayPal.", "In 2010, you posed a question to him regarding his strategy for competing with prominent DVD rental distributors, namely Netflix and Lovefilm, which were the dominant players in the market at the time.

As long as your accounts are within the FDIC insurance limit of $250,000, you're fully protected in the unlikely event of a bank failure. Sure, you might have to make a few adjustments, like getting used to a smaller ATM network or fewer branch locations. And maybe the website or hours of operation won't be exactly the same. But here's the best part: you'll still enjoy the same rock-solid protection for your hard-earned cash. So why not consider a smaller bank and reap the benefits of more personalized service and a stronger community connection?", "Honestly, I'm not sure what the actual fee is - I just used $5 as an example. But I'm not shocked that Comcast is charging $20. Not having on-demand access doesn't really bother me, to be honest. What does bother me is that the cable industry has a history of making new technologies fail. Remember CableCards? They were a disaster, and it was largely because the industry didn't want them to succeed. The same issues that killed CableCards are still present, so it's no wonder that tru2way hasn't taken off either.", "Calculating a company's Net Asset Value (NAV) is a straightforward mathematical exercise. However, the Market Capitalization, which is derived from the share value, is a different story. Share value, or stock price, reflects what investors are willing to pay for a share today, and it's influenced by their expectations for the company's future performance. These expectations vary from person to person, which is why there are always buyers and sellers in the market.\n\nWhile NAV can be precisely measured by adding up known values, the stock price rarely equals the NAV divided by the number of shares. In fact, it's often significantly higher. This is because the stock price not only reflects the company's current NAV but also investors' future expectations.\n\nTo illustrate this point, consider two companies with identical NAV per share but different share prices. The difference lies in their growth prospects. One company may be a high-growth business, while the other is a stable company operating in a slower-growing market.", "Hey there! Did you know that Chinese suppliers can now quote their prices in their local currency, CNY, instead of USD? This is a big deal because it helps them avoid the risks that come with exchange rates. Since the CNY has been going up in value, suppliers were often losing out when they had to price their goods in USD. Now, they can set prices in CNY and avoid that hassle.\n\nFor Canadian importers, this means they'll need to exchange their CAD for CNY to pay for their orders. But Canadian exporters can choose to get paid in CNY or set prices in CAD - whatever works best for them! By cutting out the USD middleman, these transactions become less risky and cheaper.\n\nJapan actually made this switch decades ago, and it's been a game-changer.

The part that really doesn't add up is when they say it's only available to members of the Florida Bar. Wait, what? Are they talking about a Florida court, a federal court, or some kind of IP/administrative setting? It's hard to tell because they mention things that suggest they're in a federal court, but then they mention needing an attorney who can represent them in Trademark/IP courts, which sounds like patent prosecution to me. But isn't that just about getting the patent in the first place, not dealing with after-the-fact stuff?\n\nI'm not an expert in this area, so I could be totally off base. But from what I know, patent litigation happens in traditional district courts, and you don't need some special trademark/IP exam to sue for infringement. On the other hand, patent prosecution does require attorneys to take the USPTO exam to become a patent attorney.\n\nIf they're in a federal court, I assume they're using the PACER ECF/CM system, which is a case management web portal that anyone can sign up for.

A common approach is to adjust your investment option based on your life stage. For example, you might switch from a high-growth option to a more balanced option around 10-15 years from retirement, and then to a capital-guaranteed option a few years before retiring. This passive approach has its benefits and drawbacks.\n\nOn the plus side, it's relatively low-maintenance, requiring only 2-3 changes during your lifetime. This allows you to take on more risk when you're young to aim for higher returns, adopt a balanced approach during your working life, and reduce risk as you near retirement. However, a potential disadvantage is that you may be in a high-risk option during a market correction, only to switch to a more balanced option just as the market starts to recover, missing out on potential gains.\n\nA more active approach is to track the market and adjust your investment option accordingly. One simple strategy is to follow the ASX200 index with a 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). When the index crosses above the SMA, it's a bullish signal, and when it crosses below, it's bearish. While this approach works well in trending markets, it can be less effective in sideways markets, where you may end up switching options too frequently.\n\nA potentially more effective approach is to combine the two strategies. Use the passive approach to adjust your investment option based on your life stage, but time your changes using the active approach. For example, if you're in your late 40s and planning to switch from an aggressive to a balanced option, you could wait until the ASX200 crosses below the 200-day SMA before making the change. This way, you can capture the majority of the uptrend before switching to a more conservative option.\n\nIf you want more control over your superannuation assets, you could consider starting a Self-Managed Super Fund (SMSF). However, I recommend having at least $300,000 to $400,000 in assets before doing so, as the annual costs can be prohibitively high otherwise.", "Newsflash: investors aren't always off the hook!

Additionally, what types of investments are considered completely safe, or 'risk-free', in this context?", "When markets are turbulent and investors seek safety, they often turn to US government bonds. This is true even in the face of a potential US credit rating downgrade, as there are limited alternatives for those seeking a safe haven. The reason for this lies in the fact that most AAA-rated governments have strong credit ratings due to their limited borrowing needs and relatively small economies compared to the US. As a result, their bonds are scarce and lack liquidity, making US government bonds the most attractive option for risk-averse investors.", "It's nonsense to think that making baby care products more expensive will significantly impact the total number of children born.

In Europe, Frankfurt and London are obvious contenders, but what about Asia? Hong Kong stands out as a prime location, given its strategic position as a hub for integrating different financial systems and its proximity to Southeast Asia. As a Special Administrative Region of China, Hong Kong offers direct access to the Chinese market without being bound by the same restrictions as Shanghai under the \"One Country, Two Systems\" framework. This unique advantage could propel Hong Kong to become a major hub for Islamic finance in the future. But will Singapore, already a significant player in the region, overshadow Hong Kong's ambitions?", "Can you write off business losses on your taxes? The answer is yes, but only if your business isn't considered a 'passive activity' or a 'hobby' in the eyes of the IRS. So, what's the difference? A passive activity is one that generates income without requiring your direct involvement, such as earning royalties or renting out a property. On the other hand, a hobby is an activity that doesn't turn a profit, and the IRS has a strict definition of what constitutes a hobby. If your business doesn't consistently generate a profit over time - specifically, if it doesn't show a profit in at least 3 out of the last 5 years - the IRS may view it as a hobby. And if that's the case, your loss deductions will be limited to the amount of income generated by the hobby, plus a 2% threshold of your adjusted gross income (AGI). So, it's essential to understand these distinctions to ensure you're taking advantage of the tax benefits available to you.", "Wake-up call: the casual dining industry is stuck in a rut!

While Treasury Bonds are generally considered a safe investment and are sometimes preferred over cash, they also have a patriotic appeal, supporting national growth. Many investors don't scrutinize the bond rates and simply invest for the sake of it, which can drive yields down. However, I would still choose a savings account over a negative interest rate any day. It appears I'm not alone in this sentiment, as various reports suggest that these bonds are a poor investment choice.", "Operating in multiple markets can be complex due to various factors. For instance, distribution costs in New York are extremely high. Additionally, different states have distinct generation mixes, fuel access, regulatory costs, taxes, and availability of green energy, which can impact business operations. Furthermore, some states have different restructuring models, such as Texas being fully restructured, while New York's partial restructuring has led to market issues.\n\nFor business customers, I recommend the following:\n\n1. Conduct energy audits and review processes to optimize energy usage and minimize peak demand.\n2. Avoid signing exclusivity agreements with brokers. Instead, shop around for prices and ensure transparency on the broker's commission per kWh/therm.\n3. Analyze your usage history, including demand, over the past 12 months and compare it to your utility tariff. Take steps to avoid demand charges and ensure you're not incorrectly classified.\n\nI'm happy to share more insights if you're interested.", "To address the question, let's first highlight the benefits of a 401k. By contributing to a 401k, you avoid paying income tax on the contributed amount and capital gains tax on the accumulated funds. However, this benefit comes with certain restrictions, such as limited withdrawals and penalties for early withdrawals before the age of 65.\n\nNow, regarding the $7,000 in question, assuming a modest 4% growth rate over 40 years, it can grow to $34,671. While this amount may be affected by inflation and other factors, it's still a significant sum. In fact, the stock market typically averages between 7-10% growth, and the bond market averages around 5%.\n\nWhile it's essential to avoid bankruptcy, if possible, it's generally best to keep the money in your 401k account. Early withdrawals can result in significant penalties and lost earning opportunities. As /u/BeatArmy99 has pointed out, the numbers show that early withdrawals can lead to substantial losses. Therefore, it's crucial to carefully consider your decision and avoid cashing out the entire amount if possible.", "The truth from the source itself - and no, he's not alt-right, despite being mislabeled by political interests from all sides.\n\nLet's look at some updates and flash news:\n\n1.

And if you have a Roth 401(k) with a match, the same rules apply, with the added bonus of using Roth when you're just starting out and in a lower tax bracket. Why not have both and maximize your savings?\n\nHere's the best part: depositing into a Roth 401(k) is risk-free! You can withdraw your deposit at any time without penalty or tax. And remember, there are two separate steps to consider: depositing your earnings into a tax-sheltered account, and then choosing how to invest. Take your time, and don't worry about dividend timing - in a tax-deferred account like an IRA or 401(k), dividends aren't taxed, so it's a non-issue!", "It is essential to note that, depending on your state of residence in the United States, your Canadian brokerage firm may be authorized to sell products within the existing Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) framework.

That's when you start to think: maybe the problem is Trump himself. #justsayin'", "Based on the discussions in the comments, I recommend a pragmatic approach as the most effective immediate course of action, while concurrently addressing the underlying long-term addiction issues. The initial step would be to obtain your husband's agreement to relinquish control of his credit cards to you for a specified period, such as three months, to assess the efficacy of this arrangement. (In my experience, individuals are more likely to consent to temporary discomfort rather than indefinite restrictions.) The second step would be to provide your husband with a means of making independent purchases, albeit with a limited budget. Some possible options could include:\n\n* A prepaid debit card with a set amount\n* A credit card with a low credit limit\n* A joint account with restricted access\n\nA combination of these options may prove to be the most effective solution. Additionally, it would be prudent to set up alerts with your bank to notify you of specific purchases (or all transactions) made by your husband. This feature is commonly offered by most banks, allowing for real-time notifications via text or email, and can be customized to trigger alerts for transactions above a certain amount or within specific categories. There is a significant psychological distinction between the prospect of being discovered at the end of the month and immediate notification, which may serve as a deterrent in itself. Furthermore, this setup may provide an opportunity to intervene and potentially reverse the purchase.\n\nIt is essential to acknowledge that these suggestions still permit some degree of enabling and temptation. If the addiction poses a significant risk to one's health (e.g., drug or alcohol addiction), I do not believe this approach would be the most suitable course of action. These recommendations are based on the assumption that the primary concern at present is financial, and I believe they can help mitigate this issue. I wish you the best of luck in addressing this challenging situation.", "I think it's unfair to label it 'taking advantage of' when the opportunities were intentionally created.

In the US, for instance, the date on the check is not a binding obligation, and the check can be presented at any time. \n\nIn contrast, many other countries consider the date on the check as the start of the payment commitment, and banks will not process the payment before that date. For example, in Canada, the Canadian Payments Association's clearing rules dictate that a post-dated cheque should not be cashed before the specified date. If the cheque is cashed early, you can request that your financial institution return the funds to your account up to the day before the cheque was supposed to be cashed.", "I strongly advise you to exercise caution when evaluating the value of so-called \"penny auction\" websites. Take, for example, MadBid.com, a British site with UK prices that operates similarly with US prices. They claim that an iPod Touch 64GB was sold for \u00a321.18, despite its direct price from Apple being \u00a3249. This means there were 2,118 \"bids\" placed. To calculate the total cost, you'd need to know the cost of a single \"bid\" package, but a rough estimate would be to multiply the cost of a single \"bid\" by 2,118 and add \u00a321.18. I suspect the total would be substantially more than \u00a3249.\n\nIt's surprising that people participating in these schemes convince themselves they're the \"clever\" ones who will snag a deal. However, it's essential to recognize that a single bidder can easily place more bids than the item's value, and if you think you're more clever than everyone else, you're likely deceiving yourself.\n\nThe \"packages\" offered are likely designed to create a false sense of value. In the past, I've seen single bids cost \u00a31, while larger packages offered bids at a discounted rate, such as 50p. The sites also encourage multiple bidders to drive up the number of bids, although there's no guarantee they won't automatically add bids to ensure a minimum price.\n\nTo clarify, these are not traditional auction sites. In a genuine auction, the highest bidder pays their bid price plus commission and receives the item, while others retain their money. In contrast, these \"auctions\" charge for every bid, and by incrementing the bid by a penny each time, they guarantee thousands of bids. Additionally, they offer products at a \"reduced\" price if you don't \"win\" the auction, which is often still higher than buying directly from the manufacturer or a reputable retailer.", "I will be sending you a reminder message on October 6, 2017, at 17:57:23 UTC (convert to your local time) regarding the following link: https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/7354iz/roku_ipo_stock_price_closes_up_67_on_first_day_of/dnolw5y.\n\nThree other users have also clicked on this link.

If we do decide to provide aid, what form should it take? Food assistance might be a viable option, but only if we can ensure it reaches those who are truly in need and doesn't get diverted by the government. Currency, on the other hand, would likely be counterproductive, as it would directly support the regime. In the long run, respecting property rights could be beneficial, but it's just one of many issues that need to be addressed in that country.

The cost of maintaining that conflict was staggering, and we're still feeling the financial burden today, nearly a century later. In light of this, are you sure the Federal government should take on that level of spending again, especially as the Fed is preparing to raise interest rates, reversing a decades-long trend of cheap borrowing?", "When penny and ultra-cheap stocks are allowed, the game changes dramatically. Players make fewer moves because the stock prices rarely fluctuate, and when they do, some players can make huge profits overnight. This leads to players cashing out and waiting for the game to end.

Upon introspective reflection, I have observed a pattern in my own behavior, wherein I tend to decline assignments that lack intellectual stimulation or fail to present a meaningful challenge. Conversely, when confronted with complex and intriguing problems, I am able to tap into my inner reserves of motivation and deliver a high level of performance. Notably, monetary compensation does not appear to be a primary driver of my productivity, as I am capable of achieving excellence regardless of the financial reward. That being said, I must confess that I am still hesitant to accept a position that offers a lower salary, unless it presents a unique opportunity to engage with a fascinating project or pursue a compelling area of interest that aligns with my passions and values.", "While I can only speak to natural gas, I suspect the same principle applies to electricity. Generally, it's a good idea to lock into a fixed-price contract, as natural gas prices tend to increase over time. However, there are exceptions - for instance, if you had signed a fixed-price contract before the economic downturn, you might have been better off without one. The key is to think long-term. (For more information on natural gas prices, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas_prices.) It's essential to do your research, as fixed-price contracts can vary significantly from company to company (you can compare options at http://www.energyshop.com/). In my opinion, now is a good time to consider a fixed-term contract, as I don't expect prices to drop much further with global economies recovering from the downturn.

When someone buys a $500,000 home in a high-tax area, they reap a double benefit. Not only do they enjoy more generous tax breaks than the average working-class person who buys a $250,000 home, but they also get to enjoy superior schools, public services, and infrastructure at the expense of others. The exorbitant home prices in San Francisco are a result of rampant speculation and poor government oversight, not a lack of tax incentives. With a population density one-tenth that of Tokyo, yet prices rivaling those of the Japanese capital, it's clear that local policymakers have failed to address the housing shortage. If a community wants to invest in more local services, that's their prerogative, but they shouldn't expect others to foot the bill.

Physical addiction is a real risk, and high amounts of THC can impair judgment and reaction time, leading to accidents, including car crashes. \n\nIt's not accurate to say that pot smokers never drive while high or smoke irresponsibly. In fact, research shows that marijuana use can cause neurocognitive impairment that lasts from hours to weeks, even after the user no longer feels the drug's effects. This impairment can affect judgment, motor skills, and reaction time, making it dangerous to drive or operate heavy machinery.\n\nStudies have consistently shown that acute cannabis consumption increases the risk of motor vehicle crashes, particularly fatal ones. It's important to acknowledge these risks and consider the potential consequences of marijuana use, rather than downplaying its effects.\n\nIf you're concerned about the safety of marijuana, it's only logical to also consider the risks associated with alcohol use and advocate for responsible regulations around both substances.", "Is investing in a business you believe in a bad strategy?", "Prior to embarking on a formal education in finance, it is highly recommended that you establish a relationship with a reputable banking institution that offers the capability to manage a stock portfolio.

It's as if they've conjured up a fortune out of thin air, but in reality, they haven't gained a single penny. There are two major flaws in this thinking: firstly, it wasn't the US government that did the crediting, but rather the receiving bank. And secondly, if those digital dollars are just intangible numbers without real value, then the government hasn't lost anything either.\n\nIn reality, governments play a behind-the-scenes role, overseeing the transfer process. Here's how it works: the sending bank deducts the amount from the sender's account, while the receiving bank adds it to the recipient's account. Every middleman involved in the transaction takes a cut, because the sender pays more than the recipient receives. The sending bank gets credited by a correspondent bank, while the receiving bank gets debited. If a bank sends or receives a massive amount of cash, its correspondent bank account will eventually become depleted or overflowing.\n\nTo balance the books, banks use domestic payment systems, sometimes managed by government agencies. In the US, banks have accounts with the Federal Reserve, which they use to adjust their balances. The international side of things is handled by correspondent banks, which also credit and debit their own accounts. If they end up with a currency imbalance they can't fix, they'll need to sell one currency to buy another. Luckily, global currency exchange is incredibly efficient, making it all possible.", "I'm more concerned about the unfair distribution of debt and subsidies, which are both inefficient and unfair.

The key difference is that when a warrant is exercised, the issuing company issues new shares to fulfill the warrant, which dilutes the ownership stake of existing shareholders.\n\nIn this specific case, for every 9,000 shares you own, you will receive 3,000 shares and 3,000 warrants. Each warrant grants you the right to purchase an additional share at a maximum price of SEK 0.27 between April 2, 2018, and April 30, 2018. The subscription price of SEK 0.27 per unit means that you can buy one unit, consisting of one share and one warrant, for SEK 0.27.

This just goes to show how skewed your perception of these countries really is!\"", "I have prior experience working for one of the three major credit rating agencies. To clarify, there are various types of ratings, with the majority focused on corporate debt and public finance, specifically senior debentures and General Obligations (e.g., tax-free municipal bonds). It's essential to note that credit rating agencies are not paid by investment banks, but rather by the corporations or municipalities issuing debt. Investment banks act as syndicates, bringing transactions to market.\n\nHowever, the situation is different for mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), and collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), which are complex structured securitizations. In these cases, there is an overly close relationship between investment bankers and rating agencies, leading to problematic ratings.\n\nIn contrast, rating agencies have continued to perform reasonably well in their traditional business of corporate and municipal bond ratings. It's worth noting that, until around 50 years ago, S&P's fees were paid by investors purchasing bonds. After McGraw-Hill acquired S&P in 1966, the agency began charging bond issuers for ratings.\n\nNot all credit rating agencies operate on this model, though. Egan-Jones, one of the 10 Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs) designated by the SEC, generates revenue from investors, not bond issuers. This alternative approach offers hope for a less conflicted payment-incentive model.\n\nRegarding Nouriel Roubini's advocacy for change, it's true that government action would be required to implement his proposed reforms. However, it's uncertain whether the government would take such action. Ideally, credit rating agencies would adopt a less conflicted payment model on their own.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that the Dodd-Frank Act has removed regulatory requirements for credit ratings on bonds and securities. Currently, there is no alternative to credit rating agencies, which is a concern. The government is expected to develop an alternative, but this has yet to happen. The question remains: is it better to have no ratings at all or to have potentially inflated ratings that can create a false sense of confidence?", "Most people considering the Cybertruck are likely motivated by a desire to save money on gas.

This age-old debate often surfaces when considering which debts to pay back first, or when weighing alternative options like investing, building an emergency fund, or saving for a big-ticket purchase.\n\nIn reality, making minimum payments and stretching out the loan term can be a strategic move, as it frees up more cash for immediate needs. However, when deciding which debts to prioritize, the math gets more nuanced. Take, for instance, the scenario where you're choosing between paying off a car loan or a mortgage. If you can't deduct the auto loan interest, it might make sense to focus on the car loan, even if the mortgage has a higher interest rate.\n\nThe key is to crunch the numbers: does the tax savings outweigh the interest savings difference? The formula to keep in mind is: tax bracket > (1 - (target loan interest rate / mortgage interest rate)). Unfortunately, many of us struggle to think long-term, whether due to natural shortsightedness or the pressing need for an emergency fund.

Should I be using a different figure? \n\nAdditionally, when calculating the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), my E/(D+E) is approximately 1.0 because KORS's market value of equity is $7 billion, while its market value of debt is only $147 million. \n\nAfter further research, I believe my initial beta of -0.58 is incorrect. Other sources suggest the beta of KORS is around -0.01 or close to 0. I found that negative betas are rare, except for gold, so I think Yahoo's figure is incorrect.

When you take out a loan and close your credit cards, your credit score takes a hit. Why? Your leverage ratio skyrockets to 100% or more, and you're reducing the average age of your credit lines. On the other hand, if you take out the loan and keep your accounts open, you're adding another line of credit to the mix. This increases your total credit, lowers your leverage, but makes lenders more cautious about giving you more credit until they see how you manage your debt.\n\nHere's the silver lining: if you can snag a loan with an interest rate lower than your credit cards (no easy feat, by the way - some lenders will want APRs in the 20s or 30s!), your cost of capital will decrease. This gives you more breathing room in your budget to tackle your debt with a \"snowball\" approach. And don't forget: your minimum payment will fluctuate as your balance changes.

As the number of channels continues to grow, the budget for each one gets thinner and thinner. And to make matters worse, the bar for quality keeps rising - think mind-blowing CGI effects and cinematic production values. It's a wonder TV manages to deliver the level of excellence it does, despite being forced to do more with less.", "When it comes to ditching corporate jargon, it's not about replacing one clich\u00e9 with another. Instead of 'going forward,' why not try 'starting today' or 'from this point on'? It's all about clarity and simplicity.\n\nFor example, instead of saying, 'Going forward, we'll only touch base via email, unless we need to take it offline, in which case please reach out and we can grab coffee,' try this: 'Let's keep our conversations to email from now on. If we need to discuss something in person, just let me know and we can schedule a meeting.'\n\nThe goal is to communicate effectively, not to sound like a robot or a rebel. By using plain language, we can build stronger connections and get more done.", "If investment banking doesn't work out, consider moving to M&A/Advisory at an accounting firm and focus on private equity. When you're ready for a change or receive a lucrative offer from a PE firm, make the switch. Alternatively, you can stay at a top accounting firm and aim for partner. While you may not become a millionaire immediately, you'll likely achieve that status eventually. Also, skip business school for now. Without prior experience, it won't be valuable, and in Chicago finance, you'll need an M7 MBA program to advance. Business school is more about building connections than learning new skills.", "Investing in a single industry can be risky due to correlation and unknown factors. If you work in that industry, you may face job-related issues and need to liquidate investments simultaneously. Diversifying your portfolio can reduce volatility, as a rise in one industry can offset a decline in another. It may be wise to allocate only a portion of your portfolio to a specific industry, especially for beginners who may struggle to beat the market due to biases or market efficiency.", "Unless you're at home every day, I'm not sure what can be done to address this issue. Personally, I'm away from home for 12 hours a day, but luckily, our neighborhood doesn't have a significant theft problem. In my opinion, ringing the doorbell is a sufficient solution, as it allows you to promptly retrieve your delivery.", "It's essential to separate fact from fiction when examining the motivations behind certain policies. The scripture, for instance, was written and incorporated long after Constantine's Roman adoption, making it a subjective interpretation rather than an objective truth. Similarly, just because Republicans claim to be driven by a particular ideology doesn't mean it's rooted in reality. A closer look at policy research and the consequences of Reganomics, as well as Kansas' failed tax experiment over the past six years, reveals that an unwavering belief in the \"free market\" is not a reliable foundation for making decisions that affect people's well-being. The truth is, actions have real-world consequences, and it's crucial to acknowledge when beliefs and explanations don't align with the reality of their impact.", "The Kraemer and Kraemer Panama offers a variety of immigration visas and residency programs in Panama, providing permanent residency and, in many cases, full citizenship with an ID.

They are drawn to the unique benefits that only Panama offers, including career opportunities for skilled professionals and specialists, as well as the chance to establish international startups.", "Debunking the myth: beating the market is not a pipe dream! While many people do succeed in outperforming the market, others fall short of earning the market rate of return. The secret to achieving the former lies in taking calculated risks, which, yes, also increase the likelihood of the latter. The amount of time and effort you put in can tip the scales, but generally, risk and potential reward go hand in hand. The truth is, you can't prove that something doesn't exist, just like you can't prove the non-existence of unicorns. But, let's be real, searching for a mythical creature is unlikely to yield results, especially when many others have tried before us. The evidence just isn't compelling enough. On the other hand, achieving a market-rate-of-return with minimal risk and effort is a much more attainable goal, especially when considering long-term tax rates. For me, that's good enough. But hey, others may have different aspirations!", "When incorporated into your daily routine, vitamin C provides numerous benefits, including evening out your skin tone, protecting skin from environmental pollutants, significantly improving hydration, and maintaining a youthful appearance. Regular use of vitamin C serum can also boost your immune system and give you a brighter, healthier complexion. Vitamin C serum is often hailed as an anti-aging and anti-wrinkle cream, although many products can be quite pricey. As we know, vitamin C plays a vital role in maintaining healthy skin.", "All paper-based investment instruments are secure; if they were to become unreliable, it would indicate a far more profound crisis affecting our society as a whole, rendering concerns about individual retirement accounts relatively insignificant. The concept of being backed by the full faith and credit of the government implies a high degree of confidence in the government's enduring presence throughout one's lifetime. \n\nIn my opinion, those who advocate for investing in alternative assets such as gold, whiskey, or nickels (or, to a lesser extent, real estate) due to concerns about the potential devaluation of currency are, in effect, preparing for a catastrophic, apocalyptic scenario. I seriously doubt that such a scenario will occur, and if it were to happen, those who prepared for it would have wasted their efforts. \n\nTherefore, I recommend investing in traditional methods that are frequently discussed in financial circles. Furthermore, it is essential to invest in our society by actively participating in the democratic process, ensuring that informed decisions are made at the polls to elect responsible leaders who possess integrity and are committed to guiding our society towards a stable and prosperous future.", "I had an interesting conversation with a consultant recently about something that might seem small, but can actually make a big difference in how our writing comes across. We were discussing whether to refer to companies as singular or plural entities. I have to admit, writing about them as 'businesses' (plural) can feel a bit stiff and formal. It's not the most natural way to express ourselves, is it? I've even caught myself struggling with this when writing about our own company - it's nice to know I'm not the only one!", "Let's face it, your kids won't be impressed by your nostalgic tales of dialing phones with rotary dials, surviving without the internet, or sweating it out without air conditioning. And as for hunting down dinner, they'll just roll their eyes. The truth is, people are wired to focus on what's lacking, not what's been gained. They're always looking to the next big thing, and what others have that they don't. It's a never-ending cycle of desire and discontentment.", "Unlock the Power of Dividends! \n\nAs a savvy investor, you're just one step away from reaping the rewards of dividend investing. Simply own the shares before the ex-dividend date, and you'll be eligible to receive the dividends. But that's not all - you have the flexibility to choose how you want to receive them. Do you want to boost your cash flow with a dividend payout, or supercharge your portfolio growth by reinvesting in more shares of the company? The choice is yours! \n\nAnd if you're focused on long-term growth, consider harnessing the potential of Dividend ReInvestment Plans (DRIPs). These plans can help you maximize your returns by automatically reinvesting your dividends in additional shares, setting you on a path to wealth creation.", "So, when you want to short a stock, you're essentially trying to sell shares that you're borrowing from your broker. To do that, you need to find buyers for those shares. Think of it like this: the ask prices are from people who want to sell shares, while the bid prices are from people who want to buy shares.\n\nLet's use your example to illustrate this. Say you want to short 1000 shares at $3.01. You'd put in a limit order to sell at that price, which would become the new ask price. But here's the thing: there's already an ask price of $3.00 for 500 shares ahead of you. So, buyers would need to snap up those 500 shares before they could even consider buying your 1000 shares at $3.01. And if they don't, your order might not get filled, even if the price drops to $1.00.\n\nIf you really want to short those 1000 shares, you could use a market order instead. Let's say there are bids for 750 shares at $2.50 and 250 shares at $2.49. Your market order would get filled at the best available prices, so you'd sell 750 shares at $2.50 and then 250 shares at $2.49.\n\nIn reality, the gap between bid and ask prices is usually much smaller. For instance, a stock might have a bid price of $10.50 and an ask price of $10.51, so it wouldn't make a huge difference whether you used a limit order or a market order.\n\nBy the way, your example wouldn't actually work in real life because most brokers don't allow shorting stocks that trade for under $5 per share.\n\nAs for your question about how often you can't make a short sale, it can happen with heavily shorted stocks if your broker can't find any more shares to borrow. And remember, you can only short stocks with a margin account, not a cash account.", "It is unlikely that disputing the remark will have a significant impact on your score, as it is merely a comment. The extent to which scoring models consider remarks and incorporate them into the scoring metric is unclear. However, disputing the revolving account that should be reported as closed is a distinct matter. The key question in this case is the current status of the account. Specifically, is it listed as an open collection or does it indicate that the creditor still has a pending claim? If so, disputing the account may have some effect, although the exact impact on your score cannot be predicted with certainty. If, as you suggest, the account should have been included in the bankruptcy package, correcting this error could be crucial in achieving your desired outcome. You may wish to attempt to dispute the account and observe the results. Even if the effect is minimal, it is essential to ensure that your credit report accurately reflects your financial situation.", "Unlock the Secret to a Tax-Free Retirement: Weigh Your IRA Options!\n\nAre you torn between a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA? The choice is yours, but let's break down the benefits of each. With a Roth IRA, you contribute after-tax dollars, but the payoff is huge: tax-free withdrawals in retirement! On the other hand, a Traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.\n\nSo, which one is right for you? If you can swing it, a Roth IRA is often the preferred choice. But that's not all - you may also be able to contribute to your employer's 401k plan, if offered. And, of course, you can always stash away retirement savings in a regular account. The key is to start planning now and make the most of your retirement savings options!", "Based on the 2017 tax rates, here's how your income will be taxed:\n\n* If you have a taxable income of $120,000, every dollar above that will be taxed at 25% until you reach $153,000.\n* After $153,000, your income will be taxed at 28%.\n* To forecast your taxes, calculate your tax liability based on your day job income, then add your 1099 income on top of that.", "Need to figure out a payment plan for a combined debt? If you know the total amount owed ($5,000 + $7,500 = $12,500 in this example), you can create a payment schedule using that amount and the interest rate. You can do this using a spreadsheet like Excel or Google Sheets, or online tools.\n\nNext, apply your monthly payments ($100) to the schedule. If your payment doesn't cover the monthly amount, you'll need to add the remaining interest to the balance. If you pay more than the minimum, you'll pay down the principal amount.\n\nThe remaining balance is the outstanding principal. You can use software like GnuCash or Quicken to make it easier to manage your payments and schedule. If you prefer spreadsheets, you'll need to set up 36 lines to track your payments over 3 years.\n\nWhen you're ready to pay off the debt, be sure to include any accrued interest to be fair to the lender. You can even add a full month's interest to the final payment to cover any remaining interest owed.", "Many employers view the excuse 'there weren't any jobs' as a euphemism for 'you weren't good enough for a job.' While it's true that there may be more workers than jobs available, employers often expect to attract top talent at a bargain price. Why settle for someone who is unemployed (and therefore perceived as less desirable) when you can poach fresh talent from a competitor, dealing a blow to their business and a boost to your own? This is the reality of today's labor market.\n\nIn American society, the prevailing 'bootstrap mentality' dictates that unemployment is the fault of the individual, not the system. Unfortunately, this recession has not done much to change this widely held misconception.", "TK didn't cause investors to lose tens of billions of dollars. In fact, the market has favored growth over earnings in recent years, benefiting entrepreneurs like Musk, Kalanick, and to a lesser extent, Bezos and Reddings. Kalanick, in particular, drove significant valuation growth, contributing to investor profits.", "When searching for online suppliers of restaurant equipment, it's crucial to thoroughly research the company's reputation by reading reviews to ensure they have a positive track record. You can also consider purchasing from wholesalers or direct suppliers, who can often provide better deals. Additionally, be wary of suppliers who charge exorbitant fees for their services, and instead opt for those who offer fair and reasonable pricing.", "If available, consider a Roth 401k, which offers a similar benefit to a Roth IRA. By paying taxes upfront, you'll enjoy tax-free withdrawals in the future.", "Think of your money as a valuable treasure, hidden away in a chest. When you lend it to someone, you're not just giving them access to your treasure, you're also giving up the chance to use it yourself. And, of course, there's always a risk that the borrower might not be able to return your treasure, leaving you empty-handed.\n\nIt's the same with gold - if you were to lend someone your gold bars, you'd expect them to show their appreciation with some extra gold dust, right? Well, it works similarly with money. When you deposit your cash into a bank, you're essentially lending it to the bank, which then lends it to others. This way, the bank can pay you interest on your account, as a thank you for trusting them with your treasure. It's a win-win!", "To achieve financial stability and independence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Set up budget categories and allocate your income accordingly.\n2. Pay your bills and expenses, and make minimum payments on your debts.\n3. Identify the remaining amount as your \"extra\" money.\n4. Prioritize your financial goals in the following order:\n\t* Build an emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of living expenses.\n\t* Contribute enough to your 401k to maximize employer matching.\n\t* Use the debt snowball method to pay off your debts, starting with the smallest one first.\n\t* Once debts are cleared, reward yourself moderately and without going into debt.\n5. Shift your focus to fully funding your retirement savings, consulting a financial advisor to determine the best distribution across available accounts.\n6. Eventually, aim to contribute the maximum allowed to your tax-advantaged retirement accounts.\n7. Any remaining funds can be used for wealth building or personal goals.\n\nNote that the first two steps are one-time tasks, while the others can be worked on simultaneously. The fourth step is optional and should only be considered once the first three are complete.\n\nYou may also want to explore the concept of FIRE (Financially Independent, Retire Early), which involves saving enough to live off passive income.

However, if it does come to pass, I will promptly uninstall the offending applications as well.", "Let's approach this situation with a clear head. The rent is late, and now the payment has mysteriously gone missing in the mail. While it's understandable to be frustrated, let's focus on finding a resolution that works for both parties. \n\nConsidering the circumstances, Keshlam's option 1.5 is a fair compromise. We can demand the full rent payment but be open to settling for half as a one-time courtesy. This way, both parties learn a valuable lesson and move forward. \n\nHowever, if this pattern continues or we notice a history of questionable behavior from this tenant, it may be necessary to explore legal options for eviction. It's essential to maintain a professional and respectful demeanor, even in challenging situations. \n\nLet's keep in mind that college students can be creative, and it's possible we may encounter similar issues in the future.

I've never seen it offered as a credit card perk, but hey, maybe it's out there somewhere. You can always buy it separately, but it's up to you to decide if it's worth the extra cash. Honestly, I think it's only worth it for super pricey trips, like a fancy cruise that costs an arm and a leg. The more you travel, the less it makes sense, since eventually the cost of one canceled trip will be less than what you've paid for insurance on all the other trips that went smoothly.\n\nAs a frequent flyer myself, I've learned to build some flexibility into my plans, especially during winter. Try not to schedule anything super important for the day of or day after your flight, if you can help it. And book those early morning flights - they're less likely to be delayed, and you'll have more options if something goes wrong. Delays due to weather or mechanical issues are pretty common, and with packed flights, it can be tough to get rebooked quickly.\n\nOh, and one more thing: be nice to the gate agents and airline staff! They're not thrilled about delays either (flight crews want to get home too!), and they can't control the weather or mechanical issues.

Secured debt is backed by an asset, such as a mortgage on a house, which can be sold to pay off the debt if needed. This type of debt is often referred to as \"good\" debt. On the other hand, unsecured debt, like credit card debt, relies solely on income to pay it back and lacks a tangible asset to fall back on. This is considered \"bad\" debt.\n\nHowever, it's essential to be cautious when considering secured debt as \"good.\" The value of the asset backing the debt can fluctuate, turning a secured debt into an unsecured one. For instance, cars depreciate quickly, making it easy to end up \"upside down\" on a car loan.\n\nThe term \"good\" debt can be misleading, as it implies that taking on debt is a good idea and downplays the associated risks. This misconception may have contributed to the high number of foreclosures, as people borrowed more than their homes were worth, effectively turning a secured debt into an unsecured one.\n\nA more prudent approach is to only borrow for essential purchases like a house, education, and possibly a car, but with caution. It's crucial to prioritize modest purchases that fit within your means to repay. For example, opt for basic transportation instead of a luxury vehicle, and keep your house payment below 25% of your take-home pay. Additionally, focus on paying off school loans as quickly as possible.\n\nUltimately, regardless of the label, it's clear that less debt is better than more debt. Even \"good\" debt can become a burden if taken on excessively.", "Before opening a joint investment account, consider the following key issues:\n\n1.

This step was incredibly helpful and I recommend it to others.", "In the literal sense, the terms 'freehold' and 'leasehold' convey their expected meanings. Freehold refers to outright ownership, whereas leasehold denotes a rental arrangement. However, it is essential to note that there are scenarios, such as the one mentioned by Peter K. in his comment, where the building and business are purchased outright, but the underlying land is leased from a separate landowner. Additionally, the business itself may be offered as either freehold or leasehold. In this context, the purchase of a pub business from a pub company may not include ownership of the physical building, which is instead leased from a property owner. The 'pub' in this instance refers to the business plan, d\u00e9cor, and partnerships, excluding the physical structure.

I've already said as much, so let's not rehash this debate!", "It's misleading to suggest that Starbucks' losses in the UK are solely due to expansion costs. If that were the case, management wouldn't be patting themselves on the back for a job well done. The truth is, the UK branch is thriving and profitable, but its debt costs are artificially inflated by importing debt from abroad - debt that has zero to do with operating or expanding in the UK. This clever accounting trick allows them to slash their tax rate, but it's a luxury only giant multinationals can afford. Meanwhile, the small coffee shop down the street or local chains with just a few stores can't exploit these loopholes, leaving them to foot a much larger tax bill. It's time to ask: is it fair for our tax system to enable such practices?", "Embracing the Risk: A Historical Perspective on S&P Returns\n\nWhen it comes to investing in the S&P, there's no denying it comes with some level of risk. But, let's put things into perspective. Since 1871, the S&P has delivered an impressive 10.72% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Yes, that's accompanied by a standard deviation of 18.67%, which means there have been 53 years out of 146 where returns dipped below 4%. \n\nHowever, when we zoom in on rolling 8-year periods, the CAGR drops to 9.22%, but the standard deviation shrinks to 5.74%. This means only 31 out of 139 periods saw returns below 4%. On the flip side, a staggering 26 periods boasted an 8-year return of over 15% CAGR!\n\nTo illustrate this point, I like to think of the S&P's long-term returns like a game of craps in Vegas. Sure, you might lose on a single roll, but over a series of rolls, the math is on your side. In this case, the expected return is a juicy 10%!\n\nRegarding the normality of returns, I agree they're not a perfect fit, but they're not far off either. When we look at the 139 rolling returns, we'd expect about 95 results to fall within 1 standard deviation. In reality, we get 88 returns within that range. And when we move to 2 standard deviations, we'd expect only 5% of results to lie outside that range. Surprisingly, we get only 1 result on the low side and 4 on the high side, making the actual results slightly more profitable than the normal bell curve would suggest.", "Can I buy VUSA on one exchange and sell it on another if my brokerage account allows trading on both exchanges? Or is it restricted to the original exchange where I purchased it? This flexibility varies depending on the broker, country, and security. I checked with Selftrade, and they don't permit trading VUSA across different exchanges. I can only buy and sell in the same currency on the same exchange.\n\nThe VUSA ETF is listed in GBP on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and in EUR on the Amsterdam Exchange (AEX), with an Irish ISIN. While some brokers may allow inter-listed stock trading between certain exchanges, such as US and Canadian exchanges, it's not a universal rule.\n\nSince VUSA represents the same asset, its value should be consistent across exchanges once exchange rates are factored in. If there were discrepancies, arbitrage opportunities would arise, and market forces would quickly eliminate them.\n\nAssuming no currency risk, what other factors should I consider when choosing an exchange to trade on? Key considerations include:\n\n* Liquidity\n* Time differences (e.g., trading hours in Japan)\n* Tax implications across multiple continents\n* Investor protection laws in different countries\n* Finding a broker that offers access to desired markets or dealing with multiple brokers\n* Regulatory complexities", "New to Adriana Fine Jewelry?

Graham's investment advice focused exclusively on bonds and stocks, with the latter limited to informed speculation. His passing occurred shortly after the gold standard was abolished in 1971. Although gold is still viewed by some investors, such as endowments, as a store of value or a means of diversifying risk, investing in currencies or commodities is not consistent with Graham's principles. A fundamental challenge in applying Graham's approach to currencies or commodities is estimating their intrinsic value reliably, which is necessary to achieve a margin of safety by comparing it to market value. Statements like 'gold is clearly underpriced in today's market' lack substance. In contrast, Graham's 'net net' approach, which values stocks based on their tangible assets minus liabilities, is a quantitative analysis of audited financial data, providing a genuine margin of safety.", "Get ready for a showdown! Many partnership agreements come equipped with a 'shotgun clause' - a take-it-or-leave-it proposition where one partner sets a price, and the other must either buy in or sell out. It's a bold move, to say the least. If you're confident the other partner can't run the show without you, you might make a lowball offer, knowing they'll have to swallow the deal.\n\nIn this scenario, your partner has thrown down the gauntlet, asking for a hefty $X to bow out. Failing that, they're willing to keep their half of the company and send their wife to take the reins. Now, if they can still contribute to the big picture and she can handle the daily grind, maybe it's worth keeping things as they are. But don't feel pressured to overpay just because they're making a demand.\n\nWithout a partnership agreement, things can get messy. So, here's a clever tactic: pretend there's a shotgun clause in place. Turn the tables and ask your partner if they're willing to buy you out for $X, with their wife at the helm. Chances are, they'll quickly reveal their true hand, admitting the company isn't worth that much and their wife can't run it solo. And just like that, you'll be in the midst of a real negotiation!", "This strategy is not suitable for everyone. Borrowing against your home can be emotionally challenging, and if investments underperform, it may lead to negative outcomes.

It's essential to consult a professional financial advisor to determine if this strategy is right for you and to tailor it to your individual financial situation.", "You're wrong about the 'go to Somalia' argument. Even if I wanted to leave the US and live in Somalia, I'd still have to pay taxes. Renouncing citizenship comes with a real cost, including exit taxes. This means I'm not freely opting in to being an American, but rather, I'm under duress. You're misunderstanding the issue - I'm talking about exit taxes, not regular income or property taxes.", "Making a capital investment in your company does not trigger a taxable event. However, if you're the owner and choose to lend money to the business instead, it only makes sense if you want to receive interest payments from the company (for instance, if you have partners who aren't contributing financially). In this case, the interest earned would be considered taxable income to you (reported on a 1099-INT form) and the company could deduct it as an expense. On the other hand, making a capital contribution is a simpler approach, and you can later withdraw funds from the company without incurring taxes. Note that while neither scenario results in taxation, you won't be able to collect interest on your investment.", "The TWRR calculation can handle negative values. For instance, TWRR = (1 + 0.10) x (1 + (-0.191) ) x (1 + 0.29) ^ (1/3) = 1.047, which represents a 4.7% return. \n\nRegarding your concern about the -19% return in the second quarter, it's essential to understand that TWRR takes into account cash additions or withdrawals from the account. To illustrate, if you start with $100,000, add $10,000, and end up with $110,000, the return would be 0% since the balance increase is solely due to the deposited cash. Conversely, if you start with $100,000, add $10,000, and end up with $100,000, the return would be negative, as you've lost the deposited amount. \n\nIn the second quarter, you started with $15,000, deposited $4,000, and ended with $15,750. Essentially, you lost most of the deposited $4,000, resulting in a significant loss, which is reflected in the -19% return.", "Think you're taking home 75% of your salary because you're in the 25% tax bracket? Think again! There are several factors that affect your take-home pay. For starters, payroll taxes, also known as FICA, deduct 7.65% from your salary, comprising 6.2% for Social Security (capped at $118,500) and 1.45% for Medicare (capped at $200,000). Additionally, state income taxes vary by location and are also withheld from your paycheck. The 25% tax bracket is misleading, as you don't pay 25% on your entire salary. Instead, you progress through tax brackets, with parts of your income taxed at 10%, 15%, and 25%. The federal income tax withheld from your paycheck is only an estimate, and your actual tax liability may be affected by personal exemptions, deductions, credits, investment income, and penalties. When you file your tax return, you'll calculate your actual tax owed and either receive a refund or need to pay more.", "You know that common advice to just eat less and exercise more to lose weight? Yeah, it's not entirely wrong, but it's missing a big piece of the puzzle. The thing is, our bodies are wired to resist weight loss even after we've stopped dieting. But let's be real, isn't the whole \"dieting\" mindset the problem in the first place? It's not about making temporary changes, it's about adopting a healthy lifestyle for the long haul.", "When determining the maximum amount of credit to grant, Bank A solely considers the credit limit at Bank B. In principle, it may be possible to persuade them to increase the limit on their card if you cancel the other card. However, given your current debt situation, a balance transfer prior to cancellation is not feasible. Therefore, Bank A must first increase the limit. To justify this increase, they will carefully evaluate your income, credit utilization history, credit score, and account tenure with them. I must emphasize that your plan for utilizing the increased debt is fraught with risk and lacks a solid foundation. Nevertheless, if you possess a sufficient income to set aside $3,000 monthly, you may be a viable candidate for a higher credit limit.", "I have a couple of questions about the income mentioned in the photo. Who do you think is behind it, and how do they decide who gets what? It seems like a top-down approach, where someone in charge gets to decide how resources are distributed.

In the 1970s, Schlitz's management made a series of disastrous decisions to boost profit margins, including altering their fermentation process, substituting corn syrup for malt, and using hop pellets instead of fresh hops. The result? A beer that, under certain conditions, resembled \"snot\" in consistency. The consequences were devastating: short-term profits soared, but long-term customers abandoned the brand in droves.\n\nBut Schlitz isn't the only example of a company prioritizing profits over quality. Here are three modern cautionary tales from the 2012 Fortune 500 list:\n\n* Morgan Stanley, the investment giant responsible for contributing to the global economic crash, sold financial products to customers while secretly betting against them.\n* Bank of America, which doubled interest rates on loyal customers and now charges exorbitant fees for even the most basic services, including speaking to a teller.\n* General Motors, which has compromised on quality by building cars with cheap, plastic interiors.\n\nThese examples serve as stark reminders that prioritizing profits over quality can have disastrous consequences for businesses and customers alike. Don't let greed cloud your judgment \u2013 remember, quality is key to long-term success.", "Ask the company to reissue the check to you as a sole proprietor of ABC Consulting (or similar).

Here are some tips to help you thrive:\n\n**Dress for Success (But Not Too Much)**\n\n* Leave the attach\u00e9 case at home - you won't need it.\n* Unless specified, ditch the suit and tie. Observe your team's dress code and blend in.\n* Be mindful of your attire, but don't overdo it. You want to make a good impression, not stand out for the wrong reasons.\n\n**Find Your Rhythm**\n\n* Pay attention to your team's schedule and try to mirror their hours. Typically, 9-6 is a good range, but adjust according to your workload.\n* Don't be the first to leave at 5:00 pm, but also don't feel obligated to stay until 8 pm. Find a balance that works for you and your team.\n\n**Ask, Learn, and Grow**\n\n* Don't be afraid to ask questions - it's encouraged! Just be mindful of your colleagues' time and prioritize your queries.\n* Be respectful and open to feedback. It's a learning experience, after all!\n\n**Network and Socialize**\n\n* Attend events with your fellow interns and be social. It's a great way to build connections and have fun.\n* Enjoy networking events, but remember to keep things professional. You want to make a good impression, not a bad one.\n\n**Stay Focused and Relaxed**\n\n* Try not to get too stressed out. It's just an internship, and it's not life or death.\n* Unless you really mess up, you'll likely receive an offer letter at the end of the summer.

The working age population includes anyone 16 and older living in the US who's not in prison, a nursing home, or the military. And here's the thing - there's no upper age limit, so it includes people who are retired. Most people retire by 65, and only about 1 in 5 people 65 and older are still working. So, how much did the population of people aged 16-64 really grow during that time?

It's essential to recognize the distinction between a city and a state. \n\nRegarding the effectiveness of the ban, I'd like to share an interesting article that contradicts your claim: https://www.google.com/amp/reason.com/blog/2017/01/02/despite-ban-new-york-city-had-more-airbn/amp. \n\nEven if we were to assume that NYC's fines and policing successfully deterred people from listing their properties, it's crucial to consider the bigger picture.

However, if your services are limited to budgeting and cash flow analysis, it may be considered accounting. I recommend consulting with your local CPA association to determine if any licenses or certifications are required for your specific work.", "Conveniently omitted is the glaring reality that this marks Argentina's eighth default, a staggering testament to the incompetence of its policymakers. Rather than refusing to pay anyone, Argentina could have negotiated a deal with NML to settle the principal and interest (or a reasonable compromise) by simply waiting until December, when a restrictive bond clause expires. This clause, which prohibits Argentina from favoring certain creditors over others, would have provided a clear opportunity for a resolution. The blame doesn't rest solely with Argentina, but it's inexcusable that this kind of financial recklessness doesn't plague other Latin American countries with such alarming regularity.", "Imagine a retail revolution where brick-and-mortar stores transform into vibrant showrooms, offering customers a sensory adventure that online shopping can't match. Instead of rows of inventory, stores will become interactive hubs where customers can touch, feel, and experience products before having them delivered to their doorstep the same day or next. With local warehouses handling inventory, stores can shrink in size but grow in excitement, hosting events and activities that create lifelong memories. The buzzword is 'experiential,' and it's the key to survival. Think mini rock climbing walls, virtual tennis courts, and immersive simulations that draw in customers of all ages. Without these thrilling experiences, retail will wither away, a fate that befell Sports Authority, which failed to differentiate itself from the competition. The future of retail is about creating unforgettable experiences that leave customers eager to return.", "I may not have personally experienced the infamous 'grad student poor' lifestyle (I juggled night classes with a full-time job), but I'd aim to stash away 10-20% of my income each month - that's $150-$300. Of course, this depends on your current savings situation. If your piggy bank is looking a little bare, consider bumping up your savings rate to 30-40%! And if you can swing it, make a beeline for a more affordable pad ASAP. Your rent is likely your biggest expense, so finding a place that costs less than $900 a month can score you instant savings without sacrificing your quality of life.", "In my opinion, debit cards don't necessarily hurt banks. While they don't lend money, they generate significant revenue from the commissions charged to retailers for each transaction, with minimal risk involved. However, a proposed congressional cap on these commissions could reduce debit cards to a mere service for account holders, rather than a profit source for banks.\n\nOn the other hand, I disagree that debit cards are unequivocally beneficial for individuals. They may be more convenient than checks, but they offer less protection than credit cards. I've previously argued that debit cards have limitations, and many in the community agree.\n\nThe real issue lies with the credit system, which is fundamentally flawed. It rewards those in debt by providing them with more opportunities to accumulate further debt, while those with no debt history struggle to access credit when needed. The system fails to assess the risk of individuals with no debt, making it difficult for them to secure credit. To me, the credit scoring system seems designed to generate profits, backed by governments.\n\nIt's essential to distinguish between credit cards and credit scores. If we replace 'card' with 'score' in the question, then the issue becomes clear. This is particularly relevant in the US, although I'm not familiar with how creditors assess risk in other countries.", "Warning: Hidden Tax Liability Ahead!

Get ahead of this potential tax nightmare and seek professional advice today!", "Think collecting a payment is a straightforward process? Think again! There are actually two stages involved, and two ways to reverse it. And, believe it or not, the specific combination of these stages can lead to frustratingly long refund times - on top of any human delays that might occur.\n\nWhen you whip out your credit card to make a purchase, it's not like the money instantly disappears from your account. Nope! The issuing bank simply sets the funds aside, saying, \"Hey, I've got this amount reserved for this transaction.\" You'll see this as a \"pending\" charge on your statement. It's only later, during a process called \"settlement,\" that your bank actually transfers the cash to the merchant's bank. This usually happens on the same day, but it can take a few days to wrap up. And, if you're shopping online, the merchant might not be able to start the settlement process until they've shipped your goodies.\n\nNow, what if you need to undo the transaction? Well, there are two ways to do that. You can either void the transaction, making it disappear like magic, or you can get a refund, which might show up on your statement as both the original payment and the refund. Voids can happen lightning-fast, just like authorizations, but once the settlement process starts, it's too late to void the transaction. And, guess what? Refunds go through the same settlement process, which means they can take just as long.\n\nSo, to answer your question, that SMS you received? That's just the authorization stage, where no money has actually changed hands yet. And, sorry to say, you won't see that refund money until several days after someone initiates the refund process. There's no \"reverse authorize\" button to give you or your bank a heads-up, unfortunately!", "In a one-car household, which is increasingly common in a rising market, staying home may not be a viable option.

The crucial factor to consider is your credit utilization ratio. Ideally, you should be using less than 30% of your available credit limits, with less than 15% being even more desirable and 10% being optimal.\n\nIt's a common misconception that you need to wait a specific period after applying for a mortgage or credit card to increase your chances of approval for subsequent applications. However, it's vital to be mindful of the number of hard inquiries within a reporting period. In your case, eight inquiries spread over two years is a relatively modest number.\n\nTwo critical questions remain: Firstly, what is your current credit utilization ratio? And secondly, are there any negative factors in your credit history, such as delinquent payments, bankruptcies, or low credit limits? These factors, including your age and income, can significantly influence the amount institutions are willing to lend you. It's essential to recognize that some of these factors can create catch-22 situations, such as low credit limits due to a young age and limited credit history. Nevertheless, understanding these factors is crucial in determining your creditworthiness.", "\"The Great Food Debate: Let's Get Real About Chemicals and Choices\"\n\nWhen it comes to highly processed foods, including plant-based meat substitutes, it's easy to get caught up in the scare tactics. But let's take a step back and look at the bigger picture. The truth is, all food is made up of chemicals - yes, even water and broccoli! So, instead of demonizing certain foods, let's focus on their nutritional profiles.\n\nThe reality is, most meat alternatives fall somewhere in between being marginally better and no worse than their meat-based counterparts. Of course, getting protein from whole, nutrient-dense foods like leafy greens, whole grains, nuts, and legumes is ideal. But let's not discount the role that meat alternatives play in making plant-based diets more accessible and appealing to the masses. This shift in eating habits can have a significant positive impact on our health, and at the very least, it's not worse than an omnivorous diet.\n\nBut there's more to the story than just health benefits. Many people choose meat alternatives because of their concerns about animal welfare and the environment. Others simply enjoy the taste, which can be vastly different from traditional meat options. And let's be real, some plant-based meat alternatives are a far cry from the frozen convenience foods made from animals.\n\nSo, instead of vilifying certain foods, let's focus on promoting a balanced and informed approach to eating. By acknowledging the complexities of our food choices, we can make more thoughtful decisions that benefit not just our health, but the planet and its creatures as well.", "**Secular Bull Market**\n\n* Driven by strong investor sentiment, leading to higher prices over time\n* Participants are net buyers, driven by large-scale national and worldwide events, demographic/population shifts, and governmental policies\n* Bear market periods may occur, but do not reverse the trend\n\n**Long Bond Investment**\n\n* Still a good investment option despite low yields (nearly flat term structure of interest rates)\n* Offers greater relative security than many alternatives, despite recent credit ratings agency downgrades of U.S. sovereign risk\n\n**Comparison to German Government Bonds**\n\n* If Germany were not part of the EU, its government bonds would be issued by the Bundesbank, denominated in Deutsche Marks\n* German government bonds might be a better choice than the U.S. Treasury's 30-year bond\n\n**Demand for Long-term Maturity U.S. Treasuries**\n\n* In demand by investment and portfolio managers", "From a US perspective, it's great that many employers offer 401(k) plans, and individuals can also contribute to an IRA for tax-advantaged savings. If your company offers a 401(k) match, be sure to take full advantage of it by contributing enough to maximize the match - it's essentially free money! While pensions can be a valuable benefit, it's essential to have a diversified retirement strategy, especially considering the financial challenges some states are facing. Illinois, for example, is struggling with pension funding issues, and it's crucial to be prepared for potential changes to pension benefits. As a state employee, it's wise to supplement your pension with additional retirement savings to ensure a secure financial future. Looking ahead, it's clear that pension reform is needed to ensure sustainability. By making informed choices now, we can work towards a more stable retirement system for everyone.", "Consider transferring your IRA to a lower-cost provider, even if you don't plan to withdraw from it, to avoid the $100 annual fee. You have two options: move it to a fee-free provider or convert it to a Roth IRA and combine it with your existing Roth account. Either way, you'll retain the funds and save $100 per year. If you need to access your retirement savings, prioritize withdrawing from your Roth IRA, as you can take out contributions tax-free and penalty-free. However, before making a withdrawal, consider whether you should be using that money to pay off student loans instead. If you're already maxing out your Roth IRA and have sufficient retirement savings, you could redirect the $5,500 towards your loans. Ideally, if possible, use your income to pay the $7,500 and continue contributing to your retirement accounts. There's no need to tap into retirement funds to pay off loans when you can use your current income instead.", "In a surprising turn of events, Consumer Reports reversed their decision and reinstated their recommendation for the Tesla Model S.

While it is true that the standard deviations of annualized returns do decrease over time, this is misleading because the asset value itself fluctuates significantly over time. As a result, the standard deviations of the total return actually increase, indicating greater uncertainty and risk. Therefore, it is a flawed assumption to believe that having a longer time horizon allows you to take on more risk.", "If you are considering purchasing a pre-owned vehicle, the first step involves identifying a reputable second-hand car dealer that aligns with your budget. You can refine your search based on various parameters, including the seller's location, kilometers driven, fuel type, body style, and ownership history, which can significantly streamline the process of buying a used car. The used vehicle platform at Masai Auto City provides an opportunity for both individuals and sellers to list their available used cars, ensuring a seamless and convenient experience for all parties involved.", "When a check is written directly to BigCo, it becomes unclear how Jack can compensate himself for the sale of his equity stake. This is because it appears as though the equity belongs to the corporation, not Jack himself. This interpretation is accurate. In this scenario, BigCo is issuing new shares, and Jack is not receiving compensation for the equity sale because he didn't actually sell anything. Instead, the company is trading shares for capital, which it will use to fuel expansion. Over time, the capital gains generated from this expansion may exceed the value of a $200,000 interest-free loan to the company.\n\nTo illustrate this, let's consider an example. If BigCo's value before the $250,000 investment is $1 million, its value after the investment would be $1.25 million. This means that the $250,000 investment represents 20% of the company's total value. In this case, BigCo should not grant the buyer a 25% stake in the company, but rather a 20% stake. If BigCo were to give the buyer a 25% stake, the buyer would be receiving a $312,500 stake in the company for only $250,000, which would be an unfair deal.\n\nIn contrast, if Jack sells 25% of the company from his personal shares, this transaction does not affect the company's overall valuation. Jack's stake in the company is simply reduced, while the company's value remains the same. If Jack then loans the company $200,000, this transaction also does not impact the company's valuation, as the $200,000 asset is offset by the $200,000 liability. The company's assets and liabilities remain balanced.\n\nIf you know that the company's valuation is $1 million and the buyer is paying $250,000 for a 25% stake at that valuation, then it is clear that the check is being written to Jack personally. However, if the check is written to BigCo, then one or more of these numbers must be incorrect. The buyer may be receiving a 20% stake, the company's new valuation may be $1.25 million, or the buyer may be paying $333,333.33 for the stake. Alternatively, BigCo's pre-investment valuation may be $750,000, or Jack may be selling $312,500 worth of stock for only $250,000, resulting in a loss of value for his shares. There are various possible scenarios that could balance out the numbers.", "Think Twice Before Tapping into Your Retirement Funds!\n\nRemember, the money in your retirement account isn't really yours to spend freely. Have you considered what your partner might think about dipping into these savings?\n\nHere's the reality check: if you withdraw from your retirement account, you'll be hit with a double whammy - full taxes at your marginal rate and a 10% penalty. That's a steep price to pay for a short-term gain. Is it really worth it?", "We're on different pages. You're referring to early check-in, which is often possible on Airbnb, but typically around hotel check-in times. I'm talking about flexibility in arrival time after booking.

But that's not the only clue to decipher. Take a closer look at fixed rates across different terms - 1 year, 3 year, and 5 year - to uncover the banks' true expectations.\n\nIf 3 and 5 year fixed rates are higher than their 1 year counterparts, it may indicate that banks think rates will plummet in the short term, but only temporarily. They're anticipating a rebound in the not-too-distant future. On the other hand, if 3 year fixed rates are also surprisingly low, it could be a sign that banks are bracing for a prolonged economic downturn.\n\nBanks are always trying to stay one step ahead, adjusting their fixed rates based on their forecast of the economy's trajectory. Since May 2011, we've seen the standard variable rate drop not once, but twice - in November and December - to a current rate of 7.30%. And what's more, fixed rates have also taken a tumble, hinting at even more variable rate cuts on the horizon.\n\nStay ahead of the curve and keep a close eye on those fixed rates - they might just hold the secret to predicting the next move in interest rates.\n\nBest, Victor", "Unlock the Secret to Smart Investing: Find the Right Advisor for You!\n\nAs you embark on your investment journey, remember that time is money!

In this case, the interest that accrues before you start making payments is added to the principal, making the total amount you need to pay back even higher.\n\nLet's break it down: if you borrowed $5,500 and interest of $436 accrued, your new principal balance would be $5,936. To pay off this amount over 10 years at an interest rate of 6.8%, your monthly payment would be $68.31. Over the course of 10 years, you'll make 120 payments, totaling $8,197.40.", "**Hybrid Life Insurance: A Cost-Effective Option for Shorter Coverage Periods**\n\nIf your uncle needs life insurance coverage for a specific shorter period, hybrid life insurance may be the way to go. This type of policy combines elements of term life and universal life insurance, offering a more flexible and affordable option.\n\n**Key Benefits:**\n\n* Premiums and death benefits can be guaranteed to last until a specific age (e.g. 85, 90, 95, 100)\n* Much cheaper than traditional whole life or universal life insurance\n* No emphasis on cash value accumulation\n* Premiums can be scaled to fit your budget and desired face amount\n* Coverage can be dialed into a specific age, reducing premiums\n* If the policyholder lives beyond the selected age, the death benefit will decrease, but the premium remains the same\n\n**Comparison to Traditional Universal Life and Whole Life Insurance:**\n\n* Hybrid universal life offers a smaller premium compared to traditional universal life and whole life insurance\n* Traditional policies typically only offer lifetime coverage, whereas hybrid universal life allows for coverage until a specific age", "A 20% deduction is likely an overkill. A more realistic benchmark is 2%, but this can fluctuate wildly depending on the industry landscape. To get a more accurate picture, I recommend calculating the average working capital over the past 2-3 years and subtracting that from the cash reserves. Working capital is the difference between current assets - including cash, prepaid expenses, and accounts receivable - and current liabilities. This means current assets will often far surpass cash alone, leaving a larger surplus after liabilities are accounted for. This, in turn, shrinks the enterprise value, making the EV/EBITDA ratio appear even more expensive, as Dimitri pointed out. However, it's essential to remember that a balance sheet is just a snapshot in time, susceptible to seasonal fluctuations. To smooth out these distortions, average the results over several periods. After crunching the numbers for a few companies, compare the outcome to revenue. Does it hover around the 2% mark?", "I'd be delighted to assist you in refining the tone of your message. Here's a revised version:\n\n\"I must say, I find it quite amusing that you believe success in the entrepreneurial realm is solely contingent upon a single, groundbreaking concept. It's a rather naive assumption, don't you think? Perhaps it would be prudent for you to focus on completing your secondary education, acquiring practical work experience, and subsequently developing a well-thought-out business plan. Only then can we engage in a meaningful discussion about the realities of startup success.\"", "My biggest regret is that the industry often prioritizes prestige over potential. It's reminiscent of the CFA vs. MBA debate, where top-tier schools with inflated GPAs (Harvard, I'm looking at you) are given undue preference. The reality is, these recent graduates often lack real-world experience and are more focused on flaunting their credentials than rolling up their sleeves. In contrast, I believe a state school graduate with a level head and a strong work ethic would be a far more valuable asset to any organization. They're not blinded by the allure of 'models and bottles' and are more likely to bring a sense of humility and dedication to their work. It's time we started valuing substance over superficiality and gave opportunities to those who truly deserve them.", "Break Free from the Cycle of Economic Hardship: It's Time for a Change\n\nAre you tired of living paycheck to paycheck, working multiple jobs just to make ends meet? The harsh reality is that economic hardship can be just as suffocating as economic slavery. But it's time to shatter the myth that hard work alone is enough to guarantee a better life.\n\nWhile exceptional individuals may be able to climb out of the hole, what about those who are working tirelessly, pouring their hearts and souls into two full-time jobs, yet still struggling to afford the basics? It's time to recognize that their efforts deserve more than just a pat on the back.\n\nI'm not advocating for a blanket $15 minimum wage, but I firmly believe that legislation should prioritize the well-being of those who are putting in the long hours. Imagine a world where working 60-85 hours a week guarantees a decent standard of living: a modest roof over your head, nutritious food on the table, access to quality healthcare, and a chance to save for the future.\n\nLet's be realistic \u2013 minimum wage jobs are often filled by young people starting out or older individuals with limited skills. Rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all solution, we should focus on targeted legislation that supports those who need it most. High school and college students won't be working 60-85 hours a week, so let's reserve subsidies for those who are truly struggling to make ends meet.\n\nIt's time to break free from the cycle of economic hardship and create a system that rewards hard work with a dignified life. Let's make it happen!", "It is our collective responsibility to provide assistance to vulnerable children, regardless of the circumstances surrounding their birth. As a society, we must address the root causes of this issue by promoting education and awareness about the importance of responsible family planning. By providing access to contraception and financial literacy, we can empower individuals to make informed decisions about their reproductive health and economic well-being, ultimately reducing the likelihood of children being born into poverty.", "Royal Dutch Shell's CEO, Ben van Beurden, has a pessimistic outlook on the future of oil, believing that prices will remain \"lower forever\". Despite the company's success in generating cash during the current downturn, Shell is preparing for a future with lower oil prices. The company has been working to reduce costs in order to survive at prices around $50 a barrel.", "Unlock the Secret to Investing in Uber: A Dynamic Approach!\n\nEver wondered how to tap into the lucrative world of Uber investing? As a privately-held company, direct stock purchases are off-limits to the average investor. But fear not! We've got the inside scoop on indirect methods to invest in Uber and even short it.\n\nOne clever strategy is to invest in (or short) companies that have a stake in Uber's success. Think Alphabet/Google (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Toyota (ADR), and other power players. If Uber takes a hit, these companies will feel the ripple effect, making them a viable target for shorting.\n\nAnother approach is to identify Uber's competitors and potential beneficiaries of its downfall. Lyft might seem like an obvious choice, but its similarities to Uber make it a risky bet. Instead, consider traditional taxi companies or service providers like Medallion Financial Corporation (MFIN). These investments offer exposure to Uber's performance, but be aware that they're influenced by a multitude of factors beyond Uber's control.\n\nFor a deeper dive, check out Investopedia's insightful article, \"Ways to Invest in Uber before It Goes Public.\" And a word of caution: while these strategies can be intriguing, they're not without risk. Proceed with caution and do your due diligence before making any investment decisions."]
