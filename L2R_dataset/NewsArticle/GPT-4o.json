["The total damage cost in Newton Stewart, one of the hardest-hit regions, is still being evaluated. Repairs are ongoing in Hawick, and many roads in Peeblesshire remain severely affected by standing water. Train services on the west coast mainline are facing disruptions due to damage at the Lamington Viaduct. Flooding impacted numerous businesses and homes in Newton Stewart after the River Cree spilled into the town. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited the site to assess the damage firsthand. The floodwaters breached a retaining wall, submerging numerous commercial properties on Victoria Street, the main shopping area.\n\nJeanette Tate, owner of the heavily affected Cinnamon Cafe, praised the multi-agency response once the flood occurred but felt more preventive measures could have been taken to prevent the retaining wall from failing. \"It's tough, but I feel there's so much focus on Dumfries and the Nith\u2014which I completely understand\u2014that it feels like we're neglected or forgotten,\" she remarked. \"That might not be accurate, but it's my perspective over the past few days. Why weren't there better preparations in place when the warnings and alerts went out?\"\n\nMeanwhile, a flood alert persists across the Borders due to ongoing rain. Peebles experienced significant issues, prompting calls for enhanced flood defenses in the area. Scottish Borders Council has posted a list of the most affected roads on its website, advising drivers not to ignore closure signs. The Labour Party's deputy Scottish leader Alex Rowley visited Hawick on Monday to observe the situation. He emphasized the importance of getting the flood protection plan right but also supported expediting the process. \"I was quite shocked by the extent of the damage,\" he said. \"It's heartbreaking for those displaced from their homes and for the impacted businesses.\" He stressed the need for \"immediate measures\" to protect the most vulnerable areas and called for a clear timetable for flood prevention plans.\n\nHave you experienced flooding in Dumfries and Galloway or the Borders?

As they gathered outside, they witnessed two buses parked side by side in the car park being consumed by flames. One tour group was from Germany, while the other included visitors from China and Taiwan, spending their first night in Northern Ireland. A bus driver mentioned that many passengers had left personal items on the buses, which were destroyed in the fire. Both groups have arranged for replacement coaches and will commence their tour of the north coast later than planned. The police have requested any information regarding the incident. Inspector David Gibson stated, \"It appears the fire began under one of the buses and then spread to the second. While the exact cause is still under investigation, it is believed to be a deliberate act.\"", "John Edward Bates, a 67-year-old formerly of Spalding, Lincolnshire, and now residing in London, faces 22 charges, including two counts of indecency with a child. These alleged offences were committed between March 1972 and October 1989. Mr. Bates denies all charges against him.\n\nGrace Hale, prosecuting, informed the jury that the allegations of sexual abuse were made by four male complainants and pertained to the time when Mr. Bates was a scout leader in South Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire. \"The defendant asserts that none of these incidents occurred. He claims all the individuals are fabricating their accounts and lying,\" stated Mrs. Hale.\n\nThe prosecutor alleged that Mr. Bates invited a 15-year-old boy to his home under the pretense of watching cine films from scout camps, but instead showed him pornographic films, leading to sexual abuse that left the boy confused and frightened. Mrs. Hale recounted that the complainant remembered several instances of sexual acts occurring either in Mr. Bates' car or his cottage.\n\nAnother allegation involved Mr. Bates taking a 13 or 14-year-old boy to London for a weekend. After visiting pubs, the boy was allegedly sexually abused. Additionally, two boys from the Spalding scout group have also made complaints of being sexually abused.\n\nThe jury was informed that Mr. Bates had previously served in the RAF and as a Lincolnshire Police officer between 1976 and 1983. The trial, expected to last two weeks, is ongoing.", "Cerahpasa Hospital experienced a tense situation on Wednesday when a young police officer receiving psychiatric treatment threatened to harm himself and others, prompting an evacuation of patients and staff. Negotiators were promptly deployed to handle the crisis. Contrary to initial reports, no hostages were taken. \n\nChief Consultant Dr. Zekayi Kutlubay clarified that the officer was alone in his room during the incident. According to Dr. Kutlubay, the officer had been undergoing psychiatric treatment for the past two years, and the hospital had previously recommended that he not be permitted to carry a firearm. Although his official gun had been confiscated, the officer somehow acquired a different weapon for this incident.\n\nThis alarming episode adds to the heightened tension in Istanbul, following several recent attacks in crowded areas, including the tragic New Year's Eve assault on the Reina nightclub that claimed 39 lives.", "Veronica Vanessa Chango-Alverez, 31, lost her life and another man was injured after an Audi A3 struck them on Streatham High Road at 5:30 AM GMT on Saturday. Earlier that morning, at 5:20 AM, the car had been on London Road in Croydon when a Volkswagen Passat crashed into a tree. \n\nPolice are seeking Nathan Davis, 27, who they believe is connected to the Audi. The car was abandoned at the scene. A post-mortem examination revealed that Ms. Chango-Alverez died from multiple injuries. No arrests have been made so far, according to the police.\n\nMs. Chango-Alverez had been staying at her mother's home on Streatham High Road. Originally from Ecuador, she had lived in London for 13 years, as reported by BBC London's Gareth Furby. At the time of the accident, she was on her way to work at a hotel. The damaged bus stop has been cleared, and flowers have been left at the site in her memory.\n\nIn a heartfelt statement, her brother Kevin Raul Chango-Alverez said: \"Our family is heartbroken, especially during this Christmas season. We will never be the same. On Friday night, we were together as a family with Veronica meeting her newly born nephew and preparing for Christmas. I last saw her as she left for work on Saturday morning, but moments later, I was holding her hand as she passed away in the street.\"\n\nDet Insp Gordon Wallace described the crash as \"horrific\" and noted that the family is devastated. \"The memory of this senseless death will haunt them every time they leave their home,\" he said. \"The driver fled the scene, leaving behind the heavily damaged grey Audi. We are looking to speak with Mr. Nathan Davis regarding this incident.\"\n\nThe 51-year-old man injured at the bus stop remains in critical condition in the hospital, while the 29-year-old Volkswagen driver is now stable.", "Belgian cyclist Demoitie tragically passed away after a collision with a motorbike during the Gent-Wevelgem race in Belgium. The 25-year-old was struck by the motorbike following a crash that brought down several riders as the race moved through northern France. Team Sky's Rowe commented on the challenge posed by vehicles having to navigate past the peloton, acknowledging it as a fundamental issue. He noted the presence of approximately 50 motorbikes in each race, including those for TV cameras, photographers, and police. The riders' union is considering measures such as imposing a speed limit on how fast the motorbikes can overtake the cyclists, potentially setting it at 10 kilometers per hour above the cyclists' speed.\n\nDemoitie, who was part of the Wanty-Gobert team, was taken to a hospital in Lille, where he later died. The sport's governing body, the UCI, expressed its intention to cooperate with relevant authorities in investigating the incident. The Professional Cyclists' Association (CPA) called for measures to enhance safety following the tragedy. Despite Demoitie's death, Rowe believes that cyclists' attitudes towards road racing will remain unchanged, as allowing fear to influence their mindset could lead to failure. He emphasized the importance of focusing on the race rather than the potential for crashes and their consequences in order to stay competitive.\n\nIn a separate incident, another Belgian cyclist, 22-year-old Daan Myngheer, also died in a hospital after suffering a heart attack during the first stage of the Criterium International in Corsica.", "Gundogan, 26, spoke to BBC Sport about his recovery from a torn cruciate knee ligament suffered in December, stating he \"can see the finishing line,\" but will not hasten his return. The German midfielder has had a history of injuries, missing the 2014 World Cup after back surgery that sidelined him for a year and sitting out Euro 2016 due to a dislocated kneecap. \"It is heavy mentally to accept that,\" he said. Though he won't be fit for the Premier League opener at Brighton on 12 August, he noted his recovery is now being measured in \"weeks\" rather than months. \n\nGundogan shared the emotional toll of repeated setbacks: \"It is really hard always to fall and fight your way back. You feel good and ready, then you get the next kick. The worst part is behind me now. I want to feel ready when I am fully back. I want to feel safe and confident. I don't mind if it is two weeks or six.\"\n\nAfter moving from Borussia Dortmund to Manchester City for \u00a320m, Gundogan made 15 appearances and scored five goals in his debut season. Eager to return, he was impressed by City's 4-1 pre-season win over Real Madrid in Los Angeles. Manager Pep Guardiola has bolstered the squad with five new signings and is still eyeing Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez and Monaco's Kylian Mbappe.\n\n\"Optimism for the season is big. It is huge, definitely,\" Gundogan said. \"We felt that last year as well but it was a completely new experience for all of us. We know the Premier League a bit more now and can't wait for the season to start.\"\n\nCity concludes their three-match U.S. tour against Tottenham in Nashville on Saturday. Earlier this week, Chelsea manager Antonio Conte remarked that Tottenham were not held to the same standards as his team, City, and Manchester United. Noting Tottenham's recent dominance over City with three wins and a draw in their last four Premier League clashes, Gundogan acknowledged their threat: \"Tottenham are a great team. They have the style of football. They have young English players. Our experience last season shows it is really tough to beat them. They are really uncomfortable to play against. I am pretty sure, even if they will not say it loud, people who know the Premier League know Tottenham are definitely a competitor for the title.\"", "The crash occurred at 07:20 GMT at the A127 and Progress Road junction in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex.

Newsround reporter Jenny Lawrence explains how storm categories are decided and what they mean.", "According to security firm Bastille Networks, vulnerabilities in the data exchange mechanisms between mice and computers have exposed these devices to potential exploitation. Attackers could impersonate poorly secured signals, thereby gaining unauthorized access to PCs as though they were physically present. Bastille reported that details of these security loopholes have been communicated to the manufacturers of the compromised mice, many of whom are developing updates to enhance security. \n\nResearchers Marc Newlin and Balint Seeber of Bastille elucidated that the radio signals transmitted by numerous wireless mice to a dongle connected to a computer were frequently unencrypted. \"This enables attackers to send unencrypted traffic to the dongle while masquerading as a keyboard, resulting in unauthorized keystrokes on the computer,\" stated Mr. Newlin. In contrast, wireless keyboards typically employ encryption to prevent eavesdropping and signal spoofing.\n\nThe researchers demonstrated that they could spoof mouse signals using minimal code and a combination of an antenna and a dongle costing approximately $20 (\u00a315). This method was effective over distances up to 180 meters (590 feet). By deploying this equipment, they sent specifically crafted mouse clicks that the computer misinterpreted as key presses, allowing them to execute commands and seize control of the targeted machine.\n\nThe Bastille team emphasized that many organizations invest significantly in securing physical devices on their networks but often overlook the security of data transmitted via radio signals. Wireless mice from manufacturers such as HP, Lenovo, Amazon, and Dell were identified as vulnerable. Bastille has reported its findings to these hardware manufacturers and to the company responsible for the chipset used in the spoofable mice. While firmware updates to rectify these vulnerabilities are being developed for some models, Bastille noted that numerous insecure mice would remain unpatchable.", "Administrators have confirmed that 38 employees at Murray and Burrell in Galashiels have been laid off.

He explained that the directors tried everything to keep the business running and save jobs, but unfortunately, 38 positions had to be cut because the company couldn't continue operating. \n\nSouth of Scotland MSP Rachael Hamilton said it was a \"sad day for the Borders.\" On a positive note, some of the laid-off workers might find new opportunities with JS Crawford, a Melrose-based company that has several housing projects and is looking to hire more staff.", "On Friday, the European Commission (EC) expressed concerns about a tax arrangement with Amazon in a detailed document. They stated their initial opinion that Luxembourg's tax ruling favoring Amazon might qualify as state aid. Amazon, however, countered by saying it hasn't received any special tax treatment from Luxembourg and operates under the same tax laws as other companies there. \n\nLuxembourg's finance ministry also defended the arrangement, confident that the state aid allegations lack merit and that they will be able to convince the Commission of the deal's legitimacy, asserting no unfair advantage was given.\n\nThe EC started investigating the tax deal last year due to suspicions it might violate EU rules. A document sent to Luxembourg's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in October explained the Commission's reasoning for the probe, noting that they saw no indications the tax arrangement was compatible with the internal market.\n\nJean-Claude Juncker, the current European Commission chief, was Luxembourg's prime minister when the deal was made. He's faced criticism over claims that around 340 global companies received tax avoidance deals during his 18-year tenure in Luxembourg.\n\nThe EC's concerns about the Amazon deal included whether Luxembourg thoroughly evaluated Amazon's \"transfer pricing\" methods\u2014how money shifts between Amazon\u2019s subsidiaries. They also questioned whether Luxembourg ensured the proposed tax regime matched market conditions before agreeing in 2003. The EC raised doubts about how royalty payments between certain Amazon entities were calculated, suggesting Amazon might have a financial incentive to inflate the royalty amounts. This tactic could unduly lower Amazon's taxable income in Luxembourg by shifting profits to an untaxed entity.\n\nThe EC said Luxembourg may have rushed its assessment of Amazon's request before finalizing the deal. Luxembourg's finance ministry insists it has provided all necessary information and cooperated fully with the investigation, including sharing detailed reports on transfer pricing requested by the EC.\n\nLuxembourg is also under investigation for alleged \"sweetheart\" tax deals with Fiat\u2019s financing arm. Similarly, the EC is examining Ireland's tax arrangement with Apple and the Netherlands\u2019 with Starbucks, as part of a broader crackdown on multinational tax avoidance schemes.", "Join us for a three-day celebration of farming, food, and family fun at the Balmoral Show, a historic event organized by the Royal Ulster Agricultural Society (RUAS) that has been captivating visitors for 148 years!

He's taking legal action against the internet giant for violating the Data Protection Act and misusing his private information. However, Google\u2019s lawyer contested that Mr. Mosley no longer has a \"reasonable expectation of privacy.\" Mr. Mosley had previously received damages from the News of the World after it ran a story claiming he had organized a Nazi-themed orgy. The images and video showing his private sexual activities were obtained through a covert operation by News Group Newspapers Limited (NGN). Mr. Mosley, who is the son of the 1930s fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley, was awarded \u00a360,000 after a judge determined there was no basis to the claim of Nazi themes at the party and ruled his privacy had been violated. The High Court also concluded that the article was not of public interest. Mr. Mosley stated that the role-play at a rented Chelsea basement flat was harmless, consensual, and private. When he initiated the lawsuit last year, Mr. Mosley emphasized that \"Google should operate within the law rather than according to rules it makes itself,\" insisting they should not disregard court judgments. Google has stated that it will remove URLs when notified, but it is not willing to completely eliminate the images from its search engines. In court on Wednesday, Google's lawyer Antony White QC acknowledged that technically, it is possible to remove the images and it wouldn't be a significant burden. Nonetheless, he argued that Google is not the publisher of this private information and claimed Mr. Mosley no longer has a reasonable expectation of privacy regarding these images. Consequently, Google aims to demonstrate that Mr. Mosley's claim lacks merit. The hearing is expected to conclude on Thursday.", "The Bath-born player, 28, has made 36 appearances for the Dragons since joining from Wasps in 2015.

Local Government Minister Andrew Stunnell stated that the three-year funding package for the service will help ensure the survival of the language. However, he emphasized that long-term funding should be sourced from Cornwall itself. He remarked on the importance of providing the Cornish population with the opportunity to establish sustainable foundations.\n\n\"In the longer term, support for the Cornish language must be rooted in Cornwall itself, rather than relying on London,\" he added. Jennifer Lowe of the Cornish Language Partnership expressed her relief, noting, \"We can now plan for the future thanks to the funding.\"\n\nRecently, the United Nations upgraded the status of the Cornish language from \"extinct\" to \"critically endangered.\" It is estimated that fewer than 500 people worldwide are fluent in the language.", "Under Jardim's leadership since 2014, the past three years at the club have been described as \"exceptional.\" Monaco outperformed Paris St-Germain by eight points to secure the French championship in the 2016-17 season. Jardim, who previously managed Olympiakos, expressed his deep connection with AS Monaco and the principality. During that remarkable season, Monaco advanced to the semi-finals of the Champions League, defeating Tottenham and Manchester City before being bested by Juventus with an aggregate score of 4-1. According to Monaco's vice-president, Vadim Vasilyev, Jardim has received coaching offers from elsewhere. \"He is one of the top coaches in European football, and by choosing to stay with Monaco despite other offers, he shows our commitment to success,\" Vasilyev stated.", "A spokesperson for the State Department remarked that the election process was flawed and could not be deemed free or fair. He noted that the Ortega administration had excluded opposition candidates and restricted election monitoring. Daniel Ortega secured 72.5% of the vote with 99.8% of ballots tallied, while his nearest opponent, center-right contender Maximino Rodriguez, garnered only 14.2%. Mark Toner from the State Department criticized the Ortega government for not inviting international election observers, saying this \"further degraded the legitimacy of the election.\" \"We persist in urging the Nicaraguan government to maintain democratic practices, including press freedom and respect for universal human rights,\" he added.\n\nMr. Ortega was widely anticipated to win due to the popularity of his social initiatives and the absence of any significant political challengers. A former left-wing rebel, Ortega has guided Nicaragua through a phase of economic stability, making him popular with the business community and attracting foreign investors. Ortega's supporters celebrated his victory in the streets. However, even before the first results were declared, the opposition coalition Broad Front for Democracy (FAD) labeled the elections a \"farce.\" The FAD, which had called for a voter boycott, claimed that over 70% abstained from voting, a figure contested by electoral authorities who reported a 65.8% turnout.\n\nOrtega's running mate was his wife, Rosario Murillo, who is now poised to become vice-president. Analysts suggest that Ms. Murillo already shares in decision-making with Ortega and could ascend to the presidency if her 70-year-old husband steps down. While Nicaragua's economy has grown at double the regional average, it still needs to attract more foreign investment. A $50bn (\u00a340bn) plan to construct an interoceanic canal through Nicaragua with Chinese investment has garnered international interest, though its feasibility remains in question.

Police maintain that they do not consider sexual orientation in murder investigations. \"To us, murder is murder, whether somebody is Zulu, English, male or female - we don't see colour, we don't see gender,\" police ministry spokesman Zweli Mnisi told the BBC on Tuesday, in response to rights groups urging more effort in finding Ms Nogwaza's killers. She was stoned, stabbed, and gang-raped in KwaThema township, east of Johannesburg, during Easter weekend.\n\nIn South Africa, unlike many African countries, homosexual acts are legal and discrimination based on sexual orientation is prohibited. However, activists highlight frequent attacks on gay and lesbian individuals in townships, with \"corrective rape\"\u2014intended to punish or \"correct\" a lesbian's behavior\u2014becoming increasingly prevalent. Ndumie Funda, founder of the gay rights organization Luleki Sizwe, welcomed the government's announcement. She emphasized the importance of classifying \"corrective rape\" as a hate crime. \"The South African constitution is highly respected and says we are all equal; we are reminding our government that this promise necessitates protection,\" she told the BBC's Network Africa program. Luleki Sizwe initiated an online petition on Change.org to urge government action.\n\n\"In less than six months, a small group of township activists has mobilized over 170,000 people from 163 countries and compelled the highest government levels to address their basic demand to take the sadistic crime of 'corrective rape' seriously,\" quoted Change.org representative Benjamin Joffe-Walt to the Sapa news agency. Justice ministry spokesman Tlali Tlali announced that a task team will start its work in July, comprising six representatives from the judiciary, police, and the department of social development, as well as six representatives from the gay community. \"The team will develop a legislative intervention plan, a public awareness strategy, and LGBTI-sensitive shelters,\" he said.\n\nIn 2008, footballer and gay rights activist Eudy Simelane was also murdered in KwaThema, located approximately 80km (50 miles) east of Johannesburg.

Stocks in the energy sector fell after Citigroup, another US bank, announced it was setting aside cash for potential energy loan losses. Citigroup's shares closed 0.13% down despite rising earlier in the day. Although Citigroup reported a 27% decrease in quarterly profit, it was better than analysts expected. Shares of Marathon Petroleum fell 3.8%, Exxon Mobile dropped 0.5%, and Chevron decreased by 0.75%. Apple shares fell 2% following a report that the company plans to cut iPhone production in April-June due to weak sales.

Mr. Varoufakis, in a critical interview with the BBC's Mark Lobel, asserted that the programme is doomed to fail regardless of who implements it. When asked about the timeline for failure, he curtly responded, \"It has failed already.\" Earlier this month, Mr. Varoufakis stepped down, a move interpreted as an olive branch to the eurozone finance ministers with whom he had frequently sparred.\n\nPrime Minister Alexis Tsipras, despite his admitted disbelief in the bailout, felt compelled to sign the agreement. According to Mr. Varoufakis, \"We were given a choice between being executed and capitulating. And he decided that capitulation was the optimal strategy.\" Following this, Mr. Tsipras reshuffled his cabinet, dismissing several ministers who opposed the reforms but stopped short of appointing technocrats or opposition politicians as their replacements. Consequently, it appears Mr. Tsipras will govern with ministers who share his doubts about the reform programme.\n\nGreece faces a critical deadline next Wednesday to pass additional reforms required to secure the bailout. Germany was the final eurozone country needed to approve the commencement of negotiations. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, head of the group of eurozone finance ministers, cautioned that the upcoming talks would be challenging and anticipated they would extend over four weeks.\n\nAmid these developments, the Greek government announced that banks would reopen on Monday after a three-week closure, though the weekly withdrawal limit would be capped at \u20ac420. Separately, the European Council approved a \u20ac7bn bridging loan for Greece from an EU-wide emergency fund, which received the green light from all non-euro states following approval in principle by eurozone ministers on Thursday.

A decision on a possible ban will be made the week of 1 August. Unlike the IOC, which decided against a blanket ban, the IPC may take different actions. IPC President Craven promised a decision in the best interest of sport and the Paralympic movement. Although IOC left the decision to individual sports' governing bodies, Craven criticized this and indicated the IPC might not follow suit.\n\nCraven expressed disappointment with the IOC's decision but acknowledged their right to make it. He stressed the seriousness of the situation, noting the unprecedented scale of institutional doping. The IPC doubts that the Russian NPC can adhere to its anti-doping code, aligned with the World Anti-Doping Agency code.\n\nCanadian law professor Richard McLaren's report, released last week, alleged that Russia ran a state-sponsored doping program from 2011 to 2015. The IPC took action after McLaren identified athletes involved in 35 \"disappearing positive samples\" from the Moscow lab. Nineteen samples, possibly tampered with during the 2014 Sochi Paralympics, are under further analysis.

Finance Minister Jane Hutt stated that the package would help \"generate immediate benefits\" for the economy. However, Plaid Cymru called it \"completely inadequate,\" and the Conservatives suggested the funds should go to council tax payers.\n\nLabour and the Liberal Democrats concluded a budget deal on Friday night, ending weeks of negotiations. Labour, holding 30 of the assembly's 60 seats, requires support from at least one other party to approve its spending plans. The \u00a338.9m windfall, to be spent over two years, was also part of budget discussions. This money is coming from the Treasury due to a council tax freeze in England.\n\nThe funding will support various projects, including a programme to help businesses hire young recruits. The government plans to use an additional \u00a34.9m to create 1,800 more apprenticeships. Approximately \u00a39m will be allocated to upgrading school buildings, and another \u00a39m will be used to deliver an additional 130 homes. Furthermore, \u00a33.5m will be spent on improving roads where enterprise zones are being established, with five areas in Wales earmarked for business growth assistance.\n\nFirst Minister Carwyn Jones remarked that using the funds to lower council tax, as the UK government did, would not significantly benefit the economy, noting that tax bills for band D homes are already lower on average in Wales. Labour has faced criticism, particularly from Plaid Cymru, for not adequately addressing the worsening economic situation. Ms. Hutt highlighted other government spending commitments aimed at fostering growth. She said, \"This package builds on those actions to boost the economy and develop public services, generating immediate benefits for our economy while complementing our long-term aims.\"\n\nConservative shadow finance minister Paul Davies expressed disappointment that ministers were using the additional resources to \"top up\" existing policies. He stated, \"There is nothing new in this package other than a fresh attempt by Welsh Labour ministers to be seen to act on the economy while spending money which would be better spent by taxpayers themselves.\"\n\nWelsh Lib Dem leader Kirsty Williams indicated that her party would continue to work with the government on spending any money allocated to Wales following Tuesday's Autumn Statement by Chancellor George Osborne.

The disruption is anticipated until Wednesday, impacting Southern, Thameslink, and London Overground services. Thames Water reported that a collapsed sewer under the track is the cause and noted the repair work as \"extremely complex.\" Engineers have identified the problematic sewer section and are working to seal it. They have laid dry concrete in the hole, creating a base for wet concrete. Once set, about 50 tonnes of ballast will be added, aiming to reopen the railway by Wednesday.\n\nNetwork Rail has closed all four lines between East Croydon and London Bridge, leading to cancellations or diversions of Southern services to London Bridge. London Overground services are suspended between West Croydon/Crystal Palace and New Cross Gate. Carl Leadbetter, Thames Water's regional network manager, stated, \"Our teams are working as fast as possible on this crucial task. While speed is essential to reopen the train lines, we must also prevent potential sewer flooding that could impact local residents.\"\n\nHe emphasized the job's complexity due to the pipe's challenging location, six meters underground. Network Rail apologized for the delays and committed to resolving the issue by Wednesday morning's rush hour. Spokesman Chris Denham remarked that the situation \"couldn't be in a worse place,\" comparing it to shutting down a major London route. Passengers expressed frustration on social media, noting the problem occurred on the year's hottest day.\n\nElsewhere in London, high temperatures have disrupted other train routes, with reduced speeds to prevent rail buckling. Severe disruptions affected trains departing from Paddington, Euston, and Liverpool Street. Southern services to Brighton from Victoria also faced significant issues following a track failure near Gatwick. This adds to ongoing frustrations as commuters have experienced months of cancellations and delays on Southern trains due to an RMT dispute. New rail minister Paul Maynard will appear before the Commons Transport Select Committee on Wednesday to discuss the Department for Transport's involvement in the issue.\n\nFor further updates, tune into BBC Radio London and follow @BBCTravelAlert on Twitter.", "Overflow pipes at the Burry Inlet near Llanelli prevent flooding but violate clean water laws in a special conservation area, as ruled by the European Court of Justice. The Welsh Government, Natural Resources Wales, and Welsh Water are investing in improvements. Although the UK hasn\u2019t been fined, it must cover legal costs for this case, which revealed multiple breaches in handling wastewater in England and Gibraltar. These issues arise from the UK's outdated Victorian sewers, initially designed to mix sewage and rainwater. Over the years, increased housing and frequent storms due to climate change have strained the system. Welsh Water\u2019s 3,000 overflow pipes, including 14 at the Burry Inlet, discharge directly into rivers and the sea, impacting protected areas like salt marshes, which support tens of thousands of wintering wild birds.\n\nWelsh Water is investing \u00a3113 million to mitigate spills through the RainScape project, which reduces sewer water by creating green spaces and channels to capture rainwater. Despite claims of compliance by 2020, the European Court of Justice ruled that the UK acted \"too late\" and failed its obligations, contributing to water quality deterioration in the Loughor Estuary. A Welsh Government spokesman affirmed ongoing efforts with Natural Resources Wales and Welsh Water to improve water quality and reduce flooding risks by 2020. Welsh Water acknowledged meeting legal permits but emphasized the need for sustainable management of environmental standards and climate change challenges. The UK Government stated that all affected sites in England now comply with directives, with plans for full compliance across the UK by 2020.", "The 31-year-old half-back has signed with Widnes for the remainder of the season after being informed that he was not part of the Tigers' plans for the rest of 2017.

The credit for this transformation goes to Roddy and his team.\u201d Under Smith's leadership as Chief Executive, his management team has grown from eight to 25 members, and turnover has quadrupled.\n\nSmith expressed his satisfaction, stating, \u201cI am delighted to leave an organisation in robust health, with the game experiencing growth and following a year of outstanding on-field performances by our national teams at every level. Cricket Scotland has seen a rise in participation figures for players, coaches, and umpires over the past decade. Furthermore, the national side has secured a place in next year\u2019s World Cup finals in Australia and New Zealand by defeating Kenya in a qualifying event.\u201d\n\nOliver reflected on their journey together, saying, \u201cA decade ago, we couldn't have envisioned achieving success in global qualifying events, participating in World Cups at both youth and senior levels, playing One Day Internationals in front of thousands, maintaining a fully professional national team, and winning numerous developmental awards on both European and global stages. I, along with everyone at Cricket Scotland, wish Roddy every success in his future endeavors.\u201d\n\nCricket Scotland will initiate the recruitment process to identify Smith\u2019s successor, aiming to have a replacement in place early in the new year. Smith commented, \u201cI have thoroughly enjoyed my tenure with Cricket Scotland, and it\u2019s incredible to think it has been nearly a decade.

Following advice from Historic England, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has officially recognized it as a scheduled monument. New Zealand soldiers were integral to the Battle of Messines in June 1917, a significant conflict in Belgium. Another memorial at Cannock Chase in Staffordshire, which also commemorates this battle, has been granted protection. This site features the Terrain Model of Messines\u2014a remarkable scale representation of the battlefield created by German prisoners of war using soil, concrete, bricks, and pebbles. Although this model drew many visitors post-war, it eventually fell into neglect and obscurity. Recently rediscovered and reburied, it is now safeguarded against damage and erosion.\n\nRoger Bowdler of Historic England remarked, \"These two monuments stand as enduring tributes to the bravery of New Zealand's soldiers during the First World War. We are delighted to ensure their preservation. The Bulford Kiwi, carved by the Kiwi soldiers at the end of the war, celebrates their presence in England and the feats they accomplished on the front lines. The strategic takeover of the Messines ridge was a landmark attack, and this model layout remains a testament to the meticulous planning behind the victory. These historical reminders connect us to our past, illustrating the events and lives that helped shape our nation. A century later, it is essential to honor New Zealand's valor.\"\n\nSir Jerry Mateparae, New Zealand High Commissioner to the UK, expressed his appreciation: \"It's fantastic to see Historic England safeguarding two deeply significant sites that hold great importance for New Zealand.

However, there's growing concern about the quality of those years, as many elderly people grapple with poor health. Life expectancy isn't uniform across the country; regions like the North East and North West report lower figures for 65-year-olds compared to other areas. \n\nIn 2014, life expectancy for older age groups in England soared to record highs. For men, it went up by 0.3 years at age 65 and by 0.2 years at ages 75, 85, and 95 since 2013. Women saw identical increases. This positive shift followed a dip in life expectancy for some older groups between 2011 and 2012. The North East was the only region where life expectancy for both men and women didn't rise in 2014, with male life expectancy actually higher the previous year.\n\nAcross England, most local authorities saw either an uptick or stability in life expectancy at age 65, though a quarter reported declines. Historically, life expectancy stats focused on birth rates, but as deaths predominantly occur in those over 80, the spotlight is shifting to older age mortality patterns. \n\nProf. John Newton, chief knowledge officer at Public Health England, praised the report for painting a positive national picture while emphasizing the importance of a good quality of life in later years. \"This report is a great reminder that it's never too late to improve your health,\" he stated. \"Simple changes like quitting smoking, staying active, or eating better can set you up for healthier golden years.\"\n\nHowever, local variations remain a mystery. Danny Dorling, professor of human geography at the University of Oxford, highlighted an urgent need to understand why improvements have stalled in many parts of England recently. \"Behind these headline figures, many older people in some areas are experiencing worsening health,\" he pointed out.\n\nIn Scotland, the situation is also on the upswing. Statistics show that 65-year-old men can expect an additional 17.4 years of life, while women can anticipate another 19.7 years. Yet, significant regional discrepancies persist.", "Operation Equinox is currently investigating claims of sexual, physical, and emotional abuse alleged to have occurred between the 1940s and the 1990s.

Council leader Frank McAveety explained that while the hike would generate over \u00a37 million, the council is grappling with a staggering \u00a367 million budget shortfall. Although many councils have yet to confirm their plans, about a third indicate they might also propose a similar 3% increase. More details on Glasgow's budget proposals are expected soon.\n\nMr. McAveety emphasized that the tax increase is crucial for maintaining essential services and protecting the city's most vulnerable residents. He assured that one in four households will not see any additional charges, helping to sidestep around \u00a37 million in severe cuts that would otherwise impact every community. Currently, the average Band D bill in Glasgow is \u00a31,213, compared to the national average of \u00a31,149. However, changes this year mean residents in higher property bands (E, F, G, and H) will automatically see higher rates, even before factoring in the 3% increase. These hikes are slated to take effect just weeks before the council elections in May.\n\nBBC Scotland's local government correspondent, Jamie McIvor, noted that heightened scrutiny will be on councils in the west of Scotland, where the SNP aims to challenge Labour's stronghold. Some Labour councillors privately admit they are in a tough spot, facing criticism for either asking residents to \"pay more and get less\" or for not utilizing available resources to mitigate cuts.\n\nWhile Labour-run South Lanarkshire plans to freeze bills, the leader of West Dunbartonshire Council expects a rise. Labour-led councils in Inverclyde, Renfrewshire, East Renfrewshire, North Ayrshire, East Dunbartonshire, and North Lanarkshire have yet to make public statements.

Proponents, on the other hand, contend that it would generate revenue for the islands, create jobs, and contribute to meeting renewable energy goals. The 370MW wind farm aims to power over 175,000 homes, even though Shetland has a population of around 22,000. It is projected that the wind farm could provide the local community with an annual income of approximately \u00a330 million.", "Mr. Besigye was the primary contender against President Yoweri Museveni in the recent general elections, which saw Mr. Museveni win by a significant margin. Despite Mr. Besigye's claims of being the true victor, Uganda's highest court affirmed the official results. \"We were informed by police today that Besigye appeared in court in Moroto and faced treason charges,\" stated his lawyer Erias Lukwago. Besigye had been arrested on Wednesday in central Kampala and transported to Moroto, where he has remained in custody. This incident is part of a series of arrests of the opposition leader during the election period. Meanwhile, on Thursday, Mr. Museveni took the oath for his fifth elective term, extending his 30-year leadership in Uganda. International observers noted that the election was tainted by fear and intimidation. In an interview with the BBC, Mr. Museveni denied the vote-rigging allegations and accused Mr. Besigye of intending to provoke violence. Responding to European Union observers' criticism of the electoral commission's lack of independence and transparency, Mr. Museveni told BBC's Zuhura Yunus, \"those Europeans are not serious.\" He added, \"Transparency is what we've been voting for.\" A key Western ally in the fight against militant Islamists in the region, Mr. Museveni took power in 1986 and is credited with bringing stability to Uganda, although critics argue he has become increasingly authoritarian.

Although Mr. Platini has provided information for the investigation, he insists he did so solely as a witness. Both Blatter and Platini deny any wrongdoing. Mr. Platini remains determined to run for Fifa president after Blatter retires. When questioned about whether criminal proceedings had been initiated against him, Mr. Platini responded: \"Absolutely not. I was heard last week by the Swiss Authorities only as a person providing information, and I cooperated fully.\" However, Swiss attorney general Michael Lauber contradicted this, stating: \"We didn't interview Mr. Platini as a witness; that's not true. We investigated him as someone who is both a witness and an accused person.\" Lauber also mentioned that he was prepared to search the Uefa headquarters as part of the investigation. The allegations focus on a payment made to Mr. Platini in 2011 from Fifa's funds for work completed nearly a decade earlier. This payment was made just two months before Uefa endorsed Blatter's 2011 presidential campaign, raising questions about its timing. Mr. Platini claimed he was informed at the beginning of his work that Fifa couldn't pay him in full due to its \"financial situation.\" However, Fifa's accounts indicate a revenue surplus of around $83m (\u00a355m) from 1999-2002, when Mr. Platini worked as a technical adviser.

He continued his victorious streak against American Nick Itkin, Hong Kong's world number seven Cheung Ka-long, Italian Lorenzo Nista, and France's world number six Erwann le Pechoux, leading to the climactic showdown with Foconi.\n\n\"Perhaps missing out on a medal in Rio was the best thing that could have happened to me,\" reflected Kruse. \"If I had medaled then, I might not have had the drive to continue pushing forward.\"", "The projects involve establishing a new propylene production facility, with potential sites in Belgium under consideration. Additionally, there are plans to enhance the ethylene output of its cracker units in Grangemouth, Scotland, and Rafnes, Norway. These facilities depend on fracked shale gas being transported from the United States to Europe. Ethylene and propylene serve as crucial components in plastic manufacturing. Ineos announced that this investment would raise the ethylene production capacity at both the Grangemouth and Rafnes plants by approximately 50%, exceeding one million tonnes. Around 150 new positions are expected to be generated at each site once the expansion of the processing units is completed in three to four years. According to Gerd Franken of Ineos, \"These expansions and new constructions will enhance our self-sufficiency in all essential olefin products and provide additional support to our derivative enterprises and polymer plants across Europe. All our facilities will benefit from our ability to import cost-effective raw materials from the United States and other global sources.\"", "His departure was reportedly one of the recommendations from former US Attorney-General Eric Holder's report on Uber's culture and practices. Uber announced that the board had voted unanimously to adopt all the report's recommendations, although the full content of the report will not be released until Tuesday. Holder conducted the review starting in February after former Uber engineer Susan Fowler alleged sexual harassment. The Financial Times noted that neither Uber nor Mr. Michael would confirm if he had resigned or been dismissed. \n\nAccording to James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt, Mr. Michael's departure indicates Uber's need for a scapegoat and might help shield Mr. Kalanick. Cakmak told Bloomberg that if Kalanick were to leave, it would be challenging for him to return. Kalanick might be forced to take a leave of absence or have his role modified, a topic discussed during a seven-hour board meeting held in Los Angeles on Sunday. Kalanick has been on bereavement leave following the recent death of his mother in a boating accident.\n\nAn Uber insider mentioned that Holder's report recommends more control over spending, human resources, and other areas where Kalanick-led executives had unusual autonomy for a company of Uber\u2019s size. Uber, headquartered in San Francisco, has over 12,000 employees. Kalanick, known for his abrasive leadership style, was earlier criticized after a video showed him berating an Uber driver. He responded to the video by saying he needed to fundamentally change and mature as a leader.\n\nUber board member Arianna Huffington commented that Kalanick must transition from a \u201cscrappy entrepreneur\u201d to a \u201cleader of a major global company.\u201d An Uber investor described the board\u2019s decisions as a positive step, offering the firm a chance to reset. Jan Dawson, an analyst with Jackdaw Research, stated that this week we would see how committed Travis Kalanick and Uber\u2019s senior leadership team are to significant cultural changes.\n\nLast week, Uber announced it had fired 20 employees following an examination by another law firm into more than 200 cases, including complaints of sexual harassment, discrimination, and bullying. To address its recent issues, Uber has appointed Wan Ling Martello, a Nestle executive and Alibaba board member, as an independent director\u2014the third high-profile female appointment to the company within a week. Uber, still privately owned with voting control by Kalanick and his two board allies, is valued at around $68 billion.

English Heritage has granted permission to replace the 16th-century bridge with a new structure featuring larger arches. The old bridge was nearly responsible for damaging a nearby Grade I-listed church during the floods in January 2014. Dorset County Council, collaborating with the Environment Agency on this project, stated that the new bridge would \"reflect the character\" of the original and incorporate \"as many of the original bricks as possible.\" The historic parapets from the existing bridge will also be used in the new construction. The project is set to begin in May and includes raising the road surface by 30 cm to fit the larger arches. The road will be closed to both vehicles and pedestrians until October.", "The 22-year-old midfielder from Glasgow was stopped by police in the Robroyston area for driving erratically at approximately 03:00 on 5 February. Upon being asked to provide a breath test, he recorded an alcohol reading of 78mg, significantly above the legal limit of 22mg. At Glasgow Sheriff Court, McGregor was fined \u00a3500 and disqualified from driving for 12 months, with potential for a reduction pending successful completion of a drink-driving course. \n\nIn a previous incident last August, McGregor received a four-month driving ban and a \u00a3400 fine for driving at 69mph in a 50mph zone. The court decided on a four-month ban rather than a heavier penalty, leaving him with nine points on his license. He had contested the charge at Hamilton Justice of the Peace Court, claiming the speed gun was faulty.\n\nMcGregor's football career began as a youth player at Celtic. He spent the 2013-14 season on loan at English side Notts County before returning to Celtic, where he scored during his first-team debut against KR Reykjavik in a Champions League qualifier in 2014.", "The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the death penalty for Pakistani national Mohammad Ajmal Amir Qasab, the sole surviving gunman from the 2008 Mumbai attacks, has reignited the debate on capital punishment. Predictably, the main opposition party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), quickly called for Qasab's swift execution, stating that those who wage war against the country and kill innocents deserve no mercy. Although Qasab can still appeal to the highest court to review the verdict and plead for clemency from the president, his crime of gunning down innocents certainly qualifies as a \"rarest of the rare\" crime, a condition for the death penalty in India.\n\nDespite this, critics argue there is no evidence that the death penalty deters crime. Two-thirds of the world's countries have abolished the death penalty in law or practice. According to Amnesty International, while death sentences were imposed in 63 countries last year, only 21 nations actually carried out executions. India has largely refrained from executing people in recent years, with only two hangings in the past 12 years. Most death row convicts in India can expect their sentences to be commuted to life imprisonment. For example, former president Pratibha Patil commuted the death sentences of 35 convicts during her five-year term. Currently, clemency pleas of 29 death row prisoners, including Afzal Guru, convicted for the 2001 attack on the Indian parliament, are pending before the president. The Supreme Court upheld Guru's death sentence in 2004.\n\nA practical issue further complicates the matter: India has only one or two trained hangmen. Two years ago, I met one hangman-cum-sweeper in a Calcutta prison who was still waiting to perform his first execution. Recently, 14 retired Indian judges wrote to the president requesting the commutation of death sentences for 13 inmates. The Supreme Court itself recently acknowledged that some death penalties it had upheld were erroneous. \"Public opinion in India can no longer ignore the global movement towards abolishing the death penalty,\" says AP Shah, former chief justice of the Delhi High Court in an interview with The Times of India today.

Adverse weather conditions, however, have made it unsafe for salvors to board the vessel on Saturday to complete the pumping procedures. Winds reaching speeds of up to 83mph during the night caused the ship to drag its anchor approximately 100 meters. This measure had initially been taken to stabilize the vessel. Salvage company Svitzer described the onboard working conditions as \"challenging.\"\n\nThe Hoegh Osaka has been secured two miles (3.2km) east of the Bramble Bank sandbank, where it freed itself on Wednesday. Water, described as \"lightly contaminated with oil,\" is being pumped from the ship's hold, which the salvors believe will reduce the ship's 50-degree list. The oil contamination is presumed to emanate from vehicles stored in the hold. Due to the ship's generators being nonfunctional, portable pumps are being utilized to remove water during daylight.\n\nAccording to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), there has been no sign of pollution. Divers are standing by until conditions are safer to complete their examination of the hull, which began the previous day. The Queen's Harbour Master has established a 984ft (300m) exclusion zone around the vessel, currently positioned between Cowes and Lee-on-Solent with the aid of tugs.\n\nDuring a Thursday press conference, Hugh Shaw, the Secretary of State's representative for maritime salvage and intervention, expressed confidence that the salvors could remove most of the water while minimizing the oil left on board. The 51,000-tonne vehicle carrier unexpectedly \"refloated\" at 14:00 GMT on Wednesday due to high tides and was then towed two miles east of Bramble Bank where it had grounded on Saturday.\n\nEarlier, at a Tuesday press conference, Bram Sperling of Svitzer confirmed there was some water ingress due to a \"small opening in the vessel,\" which has since been sealed. Refloating was chosen to prevent further damage from the sandbank. Salvage experts boarded the Hoegh Osaka on Monday to begin their assessment and formulate a recovery plan.\n\nThe Singapore-registered ship, loaded with 1,400 cars, including 1,200 Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles, 65 Minis, as well as 105 JCB machines and 500 tonnes of fuel, set sail for Germany on Saturday at approximately 20:20 before it began to list unexpectedly. The crew deliberately grounded the ship, and 25 crew members were rescued by RNLI Lifeboats and the Solent Coastguard, with two sustaining non-life-threatening injuries.

Authorities stated that the death toll had increased to 358 after two severely burned victims passed away in the hospital. Honduran President Porfirio Lobo has mandated a safety audit of all prisons as experts attempt to determine the causes of the fire in the Comayagua facility. Forensic pathologists are still working to identify the victims' remains, noting that many are so badly charred they can only be identified through DNA analysis. Thus far, only 18 bodies have been returned to their families for interment. Fatal Conditions Out of the 358 fatalities, all except one were inmates. The sole non-inmate was the spouse of a prisoner who was visiting her husband. Forensic specialists from Chile, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Mexico have joined forces with their Honduran counterparts to expedite the identification process.

This decrease was partly due to the company shelling out an extra \u00a344 million in gambling duties, prompted by revised taxation rules for online betting and fixed-odds betting terminals. Additionally, William Hill acquired a 29.4% stake in the online lottery company NeoGames for $25 million (\u00a316 million). By mid-morning, the bookmaker's shares had plummeted by over 7%.\n\nA significant shift occurred in December of the previous year when the Point of Consumption Tax was implemented, targeting profits from UK-based gamblers. Moreover, in March, the levy on fixed-odds betting terminals, known as Machine Games Duty, saw an increase to 25%. Despite these hurdles, CEO James Henderson highlighted the company's solid operational performance amidst substantial regulatory and taxation changes. He noted, \"While the Point of Consumption Tax and the hike in Machine Games Duty have raised our costs as anticipated, we remain focused on our strategy and long-term growth investments.\"\n\nWilliam Hill's profits were also impacted by one-off expenses associated with rebranding its Australian operations. This profit downturn came despite a modest rise in net revenues, which edged up to \u00a3808.1 million from the previous year's \u00a3805.2 million. Looking ahead, the company acknowledged that the newly implemented National Living Wage would add expenses of about \u00a31 million to \u00a32 million in 2016.\n\nRegarding the stake in NeoGames, Mr. Henderson characterized the online lottery market as a \"thrilling opportunity.\" William Hill pointed out that NeoGames predominantly operates in the US, where lottery spending per capita is the highest globally.

In football, Leicester are five points clear with seven games remaining. \"It's good, it's better being compared to someone at the top,\" Brown told the BBC Super League Show. \"I don't really listen to what people say about where we finish. As long as we're playing well and doing our thing, you can compare us to whoever you want. If they're at the top of the league and going to win something, then I hope we can keep it up and they can keep comparing us to them.\"\n\nThe Vikings have scored 230 points so far this season, the highest in Super League, and only Wigan and Warrington have conceded fewer. The key to their improvement has been the acquisition of strong forwards and a toughness instilled by head coach Denis Betts and his coaching staff. \"Our attack has been pretty good for the last few years but now we've got real lads working their socks off in the middle coupled with some really good edge defenders,\" said Brown. \"The lads who have come in have helped our attack but Chris Houston, Corey Thompson, Chris Bridge, Charly Runciman - these lads are competent, experienced players who know how to defend. Above everything, the defensive side of our game has improved out of sight.\"\n\nNo team has scored more tries than the 42 by Widnes, an average of six per game. Their six wins from seven is a record Brown attributes to the atmosphere within the club. \"I know it looks like we're just playing fancy-free, but there's a lot more structure and respect for the ball than that,\" he added. \"From Monday to Sunday it's fun all the way.

Professor Terry Hughes from the National Coral Bleaching Taskforce informed the BBC that the connection between bleaching and global warming is \"very well established.\" Increased water temperatures cause corals to expel the algae that give them color. If conditions do not normalize, the corals can die.\n\nAccording to the taskforce's survey, the most extensive damage is in the northern section of the 2,300 km (1,429 mile)-long reef, off the coast of Queensland. Only 7% of the reef showed no signs of bleaching, Professor Hughes indicated. The rise in sea temperatures leading to bleaching is attributed to El Nino effects and climate change. More than 900 individual reefs were examined using a light plane and a helicopter, with the aerial survey's accuracy verified by scuba diving teams.\n\n\"I am naturally an optimist, but I believe we have a rapidly narrowing window of opportunity to save the Great Barrier Reef,\" Professor Hughes remarked. \"If we don't address global warming, the reef will continue to degrade. After three bleaching events, the coral species composition has already altered.\" He noted that this bleaching event is substantially more severe than those recorded in 2002 and 1998. \"This time, only 7% of the reef didn't bleach, compared to nearly 40% in the previous two events. If these events become as frequent as every five to ten years, coral regeneration will not be sufficient.\"\n\nTourism to the Great Barrier Reef generates A$5bn ($3.9b, \u00a32.7bn) annually and employs approximately 70,000 people, according to the National Coral Bleaching Taskforce.

Ms. Sands discovered Pleasted's alleged abuse of three boys and claimed he was \"asking for trouble\" when she spoke to police. Pleasted, previously charged with sexually assaulting two children under 13, was found dead in his Canning Town flat on November 28. Ms. Sands has pleaded not guilty to murder.\n\nThe court heard that on the evening in question, Ms. Sands consumed two bottles of wine and a bottle of brandy before arming herself with a knife. Prosecutor Jonathan Ree presented CCTV footage showing Ms. Sands in Pleasted's building for approximately 20 minutes. While awaiting trial for his charges, Pleasted was out on bail and under investigation for allegedly abusing a third boy.\n\nMs. Sands had initially befriended Pleasted, a well-known local figure who operated a bric-a-brac shop from a nearby Mace convenience store. Their friendship included her visiting his home and bringing him meals, until she learned of the abuse allegations. Following the stabbing, Ms. Sands traveled to the Isle of Dogs, disposing of the knife and her clothing in a carrier bag. She later informed a family friend, \"I stabbed him,\" before deciding to turn herself in to authorities.\n\nIn her police interview, Ms. Sands claimed she had attempted to help Pleasted, unaware he was abusing children at the time. She later stated she did not intend to kill or seriously harm Pleasted, explaining she brought the knife for her protection.

The report pulls no punches, revealing that Australia seems to be intentionally allowing the abuse of detainees to dissuade other asylum seekers.\n\nBut that's not all\u2014the Immigration Department fired back, slamming Amnesty for not consulting them. \"There was no consultation with the Department of Immigration and Border Protection from Amnesty International in preparation of this report,\" they said. \"We strongly refute many of the allegations and urge Amnesty International to contact us before airing such claims.\" The statement also asserted that Australia doesn\u2019t control Nauru's laws, as Nauru is a sovereign country, and welcomed independent scrutiny of its facilities. \n\nAustralia is known for transporting asylum seekers who reach their shores by boat to offshore processing centers in Nauru and Papua New Guinea. This report from Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch is especially gripping as it comes after an undercover visit to Nauru last month! The report suggests that Australia's policy is deliberately aimed at deterring other migrants from attempting to reach Australia. \n\nWhile the report didn\u2019t include documentary evidence, it featured powerful interviews with 84 refugees and asylum seekers. They shared harrowing accounts of rape and assault by Nauruan locals, inadequate medical care, and living in unbearably cramped conditions. The detention center is managed by Broadspectrum, with medical services provided by International Health and Medical Services, both under contract with the Australian government.\n\nOne woman recounted marrying a man 15 years her senior just to feel safe, and another recalled how Nauruan men tried to drive her into the jungle to assault her. Despite many being recognized as genuine refugees and released into the community, fear pervades\u2014especially at night.\n\nThe report also pointed a finger at Nauruan police, alleging they often downplay or ignore reports of abuse from asylum seekers.

Labour countered, claiming Tory NHS figures \"don't add up.\" Mr. Davies assured that Welsh Conservatives would safeguard health spending and introduce a cancer drugs fund. He justified focusing on a devolved issue, noting, \"Ed Miliband's 'compare and contrast' example is apt. We lack a cancer drugs fund in Wales and face record-low ambulance response times.\"\n\n\"The upcoming election presents a stark choice: back the Conservative party committed to protecting health spending or endorse a party that has drastically slashed health services in Wales,\" Mr. Davies asserted. In response, Welsh Labour's Deputy Health Minister Vaughan Gething accused the Tories of planning to privatize the NHS. \"The Tories have thrice avoided ruling out NHS privatization during this campaign,\" he stated. Gething emphasized, \"This election is crucial: a Labour government pledges to train an additional 1,000 doctors, nurses, and frontline staff, while a Tory government threatens a 'tablet tax' and privatization of health services.\"\n\nOn the campaign trail, Welsh Lib Dem leader Kirsty Williams advocated for improved rural healthcare in mid Wales. \"Investing in cottage hospitals and community care is vital.

This led to complaints that the signs were detracting from the conservation area's charm. The council explained that it used railings as much as possible to minimize the number of posts on the pavement. They reported having regular meetings with English Heritage to discuss work on listed buildings and relevant legislation. When signs were erected in the Kingsdown conservation area, the council was advised that as long as no \"significant or permanent changes\" were made to buildings that would alter their character, it was acceptable. English Heritage's letter, obtained by the BBC, expressed concerns about the \"potential cumulative impact\" of the signs in West Mall and Caledonia Place, areas containing listed buildings. The letter suggested that the combined effect of the signs might fall under Section 7 of the Planning and Listed Buildings and Conservation Act 1990. English Heritage recommended seeking listed building consent to carefully assess the impact of the signs on the terrace's special interest, consider the number of signs, and explore alternative locations.

Blatter, aged 79, along with vice-president Michel Platini, has been suspended for 90 days due to corruption allegations, which both vehemently deny. Platini, aiming for the presidency, is up against Prince Ali bin al-Hussein. Despite Platini submitting his candidacy papers earlier this month, Fifa has stated it cannot recognize his bid while his ban remains effective, preventing him from campaigning. However, the electoral committee might allow his candidacy if his suspension is lifted before the election.\n\nAdditionally, Shaikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa of Bahrain is anticipated to join the race. Former Trinidad and Tobago midfielder David Nakhid has declared his candidacy, while ex-Tottenham defender Ramon Vega is weighing his options. Another confirmed candidate, South Korean Chung Mong-joon, has accused Fifa's ethics committee of \"sabotaging\" his campaign with a six-year ban.

After Mr. Ozanne shared his decision on Tuesday, a wave of demonstrators, bearing \"Black Lives Matter\" banners, gathered in Madison.\n\nAndrea Irwin, Tony Robinson's mother, passionately declared her resolve to \"continue the fight\" in front of a congregation of supporters outside Grace Episcopal Church. Earlier, Mr. Ozanne expressed his sorrow over \"this tragic and unfortunate death\" but emphasized it resulted from a \"lawful use of deadly police force,\" ruling out charges against Officer Kenny.\n\nThe fateful night began with Officer Kenny responding to reports of a man obstructing traffic, reportedly involved in an assault. Autopsy results later revealed Robinson had various illicit drugs in his system, contributing to his erratic behavior reported by friends in multiple 911 calls. Described as \"acting crazy,\" Robinson allegedly tried to choke one friend, attacked others on the sidewalk, and darted into traffic. Officer Kenny, upon entering the apartment building, claimed he was assaulted by Robinson at the top of the stairs, fearing he would be overpowered and potentially disarmed. In response, Kenny fired seven shots.\n\nDespite these accounts, Robinson's relatives and many Wisconsin protesters maintain he was a victim of police brutality. D.A.

At the top was a notable London restaurant, San Lorenzo in Wimbledon, which owed nearly \u00a3100,000 to 30 employees. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy confirmed that all owed wages had been repaid to the workers. This release represented the largest disclosure since the introduction of the \"naming and shaming\" initiative in October 2013. \n\nTo date, 688 employers have been publicly identified for violating wage laws, with total arrears exceeding \u00a33.5 million. Business Minister Margot James emphasized the government's commitment to enforcing wage laws, stating that it was unacceptable for employers to pay less than the minimum wage and that the practice of naming and shaming would persist for lawbreakers.\n\nAmong those listed, Premier Recruitment Ltd in Derby owed \u00a334,797.33 to 424 workers, while football clubs Blackpool FC and Brighton and Hove Albion owed \u00a32,861.64 to one worker each. Brighton and Hove Albion argued that their inclusion on the list unfairly damaged their reputation due to a minor administrative error regarding overpayment of expenses to a work experience individual two years earlier. The club maintained that it compensates staff above the National Living Wage.\n\nTUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady urged for prosecution of the most egregious offenders, highlighting the severe nature of some underpayment cases. This list\u2019s publication follows the introduction of a new National Living Wage in April, mandating a minimum wage of \u00a37.20 per hour for employees aged 25 and over.

Known as the Lyssa Zampa tropical moth or the Laos brown butterfly, these mesmerising insects are native to South East Asia. \n\nBiology lecturer N Sivasothi noted that while the recent influx of moths seems extraordinary, it's not entirely unusual. \"These moths are present at other times of the year but in very small numbers, so they usually go unnoticed,\" he explained, adding that they generally emerge in greater numbers between April and August. \n\nEcologist Anuj Jain pointed out that these moths navigate by light, often leading them to urban areas. \"Their search for new, uneaten host plants draws them toward the lights of cities,\" he said. Despite their sudden appearance, experts assured that these nocturnal visitors pose no threat. \"People with asthma may be sensitive to the hairs on their wings, but they are otherwise harmless,\" said Lena Chan, Director of the National Biodiversity Centre at Singapore\u2019s National Parks Board. \"There is no need for concern\u2014they don\u2019t cause allergies or diseases and are actually vital pollinators.\"\n\nThe internet buzzed with Malaysians and Singaporeans sharing their moth encounters and uploading stunning photographs of these winged wonders.

Human activities have forced these rare birds to cling to survival in a single remaining wetland, which lacks the necessary food resources.\n\nPublished in Bird Conservation International, the research spearheaded by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT) found that only 25 individual pochards now exist in the wild. The detrimental impact of deforestation, farming, and fishing has obliterated their habitats, confining the last surviving population to a complex of lakes near Bemanevika in north-east Madagascar.\n\nFollowing the species\u2019 rediscovery in 2006, WWT, alongside partners like the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust and the Peregrine Fund, initiated a conservation breeding program and began meticulous monitoring. According to Dr. Geoff Hilton, head of species research at WWT, tracking such a small number of birds presented a tragically straightforward task. \u201cWe had about 10 or 11 females, [and] most were laying eggs, which hatched. But at two to three weeks old, the ducklings started disappearing,\u201d Dr. Hilton recounted to BBC News.\n\nInvestigations revealed that the chicks were starving. The steep crater lake, while seemingly a refuge, proved too deep for the diving ducks to access adequate food from the lake bed. \"The last refuge of the Madagascar pochard is one of the country\u2019s final unspoiled wetlands, but it\u2019s simply not suitable for their needs,\" explained Dr. Andrew Bamford, the lead researcher.\n\nDr. Hilton highlighted the broader conservation dilemma: \"The remaining habitat isn\u2019t ideal; it\u2019s just the least impacted by human activities.\" Despite these bleak findings, hope remains. The researchers are optimistic that the species can flourish again if relocated to a more suitable wetland. \"We've been successful in establishing a captive population,\" said Dr. Hilton. \"We've identified a promising lake for restoration as a reintroduction site.\"\n\nHe emphasized that collaboration with local communities is crucial. \"The key is to work with local people to reintroduce and restore the pochard, while also improving livelihoods around the lake.\"\n\nStay tuned to hear more updates on this hopeful endeavor by following Victoria on Twitter.", "The new week-long round-robin competition aims to give more T20 tournament experience to the eight associate countries involved.

This recommendation comes amid a shortage of consultant paediatricians. The proposed change will be discussed at the full health board meeting on November 24. The PACU currently treats children experiencing acute pain, high temperatures, sickness, infections, or needing dressings, blood tests, x-rays, or scans. If the proposal is approved, the unit would operate from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM GMT daily, instead of its current hours of 10:00 AM to 10:00 PM. Children needing assessment after the new closing time would be transferred by ambulance to Glangwili Hospital in Carmarthen. The health board attributes the reduction in hours to \"longstanding difficulties in recruiting paediatric consultants across the UK,\" exacerbated by the retirement of a Pembrokeshire paediatric consultant and another on maternity leave. They warn that inaction poses a significant \"risk.\" An additional recommendation is to merge the on-call rota with Carmarthenshire's system, meaning remote advice would be provided by on-call paediatric consultants for out-of-hours emergencies at Withybush Hospital.

Skipper Bridge, along with Male, Warren, and Goslin, died after the yacht lost its keel over 700 miles from Nova Scotia, Canada.\n7. The yacht was found by a container ship on May 17, with life rafts still on board.\n8. Despite the rapid capsize, emergency beacons suggested that Bridge and Male might have survived for some time in the water.\n9. Criticism arose over the US Coastguard's initial cessation of the search after two days, but it was resumed following protests and British government intervention.\n\nThe trial continues.", "The 23-year-old has been acquired from Atletico Madrid for a record fee of \u00a315m following Fernando Llorente's departure to Sevilla. Borja commented, \"We are flexible and can play with two strikers or just one, depending on the boss's requirements.\" The record signing will miss Swansea's season opener against Burnley. Speaking about Llorente, Borja added, \"We haven't met personally, but I've been told he's a great guy. I'm confident we'll work well together and do what's best for the team.\" Originally from Madrid, Borja came through Atletico's academy but has spent the last five seasons on loan away from the Vicente Calderon. \"It's naturally a bit frustrating not to have played much at Atletico,\" said Borja, who netted 18 goals in La Liga for Eibar last season. \"I grew up there, rose through the ranks, and wish I had more opportunities with the first team.\" Despite interest from La Liga and Premier League clubs, Borja says choosing Swansea was straightforward. \"Swansea showed the most interest and seemed to want me the most,\" he said. \"They are a great club with a lot of confidence in their players, and I really want to make a positive impact here.\" Unlike 31-year-old Llorente, part of Spain's 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012-winning squads, Borja has yet to receive a senior call-up for his country. Nonetheless, he hopes to follow in the footsteps of ex-Swans striker Michu, who earned a national team cap after a successful season with Swansea. \"Michu did an excellent job at Swansea, which eventually got him into Spain's squad,\" said Borja. \"If only I could score as many goals as he did, supporting the team as much as possible, it would be great for Swansea and might also put me in contention for the national team.\"", "Officers were called to Bury Old Road in Greater Manchester, where a large Orthodox Jewish community was celebrating Rosh Hashanah on Monday.

A nationwide strike against new labor laws is causing disruptions across all eight of France's oil refineries. Approximately 20% of petrol stations are experiencing either total depletion or critical shortages of supplies. French social media users are creatively referencing films like Total Recall, a sci-fi movie from both 1990 and 2012, noting that \"Total\" is also a well-known French multinational oil and gas company. \n\nUsers have humorously altered film names to comment on the shortage: Pulp Fiction turned into Pump Friction, The Full Monty was reinvented as The Fuel Monty, and Mad Max: Fury Road became Mad Max: Fury Bicycle Lane. Actor Vin Diesel's name, a nod to fuel, and his Fast and Furious franchise, inspired titles such as Last and Furious, Pas Fast Mais Furious (Not Fast But Furious), Immobile and Furious, and Fuel Furious. Meanwhile, Eminem\u2019s semi-autobiographical film 8 Mile was rebranded as 0 Mile and 8 Miles \u00e0 Pied (8 Miles on Foot). Director Stanley Kubrick's works led to titles like Fuel Metal Jacket, referencing his 1987 movie Full Metal Jacket, and 2001, l\u2019Odyssee de l\u2019espace, a twist on Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, while also playing on the name of Renault's Espace minivan.\n\nImages of people filling jerrycans at petrol stations sparked more film title puns such as Tom and Jerrycan, Jerrycan Beauty, and Catch Me If You Jerrycan. Additionally, Nicolas Winding Refn\u2019s 2011 movie Drive was humorously changed to Walk and Drive Pas.

The bank's consumer banking division, its largest sector, saw a 5% profit increase, reaching $1.8 billion. Residential mortgage lending climbed 13% to $17 billion. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan stated that the core aspects of their business, including deposit taking and lending to both consumer and corporate clients, showed positive trends, while trading results for clients remained stable despite challenging market conditions. Since 2008, the bank has incurred over $70 billion in legal expenses, but noted a reduction in legal costs for the third consecutive quarter, decreasing to $231 million from $6 billion the previous year.\n\nIn a separate development, Wells Fargo experienced its first profit increase in three quarters, bolstered by the acquisition of commercial loans from General Electric earlier this year. The bank's net income rose 0.65% year over year to $5.44 billion for the quarter ending in September, with revenues increasing by 3% to $21.9 billion. Mortgage banking revenue, however, declined by 2.7% to $1.59 billion. Earlier this year, Wells Fargo acquired a $9 billion portion of GE's commercial real estate loans, contributing to the improved quarterly profits.

It was only when he heard persistent meows from within the walls that he realized a feline was trapped. \"At first, I was in complete disbelief,\" Mr. Baird recounted. Armed with a drill, chisel, and hammer, he painstakingly freed Francee and shared the dramatic rescue on Facebook to help locate her owner. The heartwarming video quickly gained traction, being shared over 700 times, and eventually led to Francee being joyously reunited with her owner. Although slightly shaken, the cat emerged from the ordeal unscathed. Mr. Baird speculated that Francee managed to climb a ladder to the first floor and then became wedged in a narrow wall cavity. \"The only way she could've ended up there was from above. Lucky for her, I was there to discover her plight,\" he said. \"It was a tight space filled with insulation. I had to pull some out and use my tools to set her free.\" Grateful for the happy ending, he added with a chuckle, \"My phone hasn't stopped buzzing since I posted the video. But I'm just relieved to have found her owner and that it all turned out well.\"", "Shamsul Arefin brought four people from Bangladesh to work at the Stewart Hotel in Argyll over three years. His victims took out loans to pay him for employment, with one facing threats of kidney removal by money lenders if he didn't repay his debt. Arefin's actions were deemed \"modern-day slavery,\" and he was found guilty of violating the Asylum and Immigration Act at Fort William Sheriff Court. Between 2008 and 2010, he recruited them as chefs, demanding substantial payments as \"deposits.\" Upon arrival, their wages were greatly reduced, and they were forced to work long hours performing various tasks beyond cooking, including painting and cleaning in harsh conditions. Arefin threatened to fire them when they complained and refused to return their money. The crimes were uncovered following an investigation by the UK Border Agency and Northern Constabulary.\n\nKath Harper, a lead prosecutor for human trafficking, highlighted that Arefin's greed had severe implications for his victims and their families. Kevin Hyland, independent anti-slavery commissioner, praised the bravery of the men who testified and emphasized the severity of the case. Det Insp Richard Baird from Police Scotland noted that Arefin's financial greed led to inhumane working conditions, and bringing him to justice helped dismantle an illegal operation and potentially saved future victims.", "The London Paramount resort on the Swanscombe Peninsula near Dartford will be twice the size of the Olympic Park, featuring 5,000 hotel rooms and a water park. Developers need more research on traffic and environmental issues before seeking a development consent order. If approved, it will open in 2021 instead of Easter 2020. The 900-acre park will offer over 50 rides and attractions based on films and TV shows. London Paramount's CEO, David Testa, stated they are postponing the submission date for the consent order to allow more time for ongoing studies and discussions with the Planning Inspectorate and local authorities.", "Fourteen-time major champion Tiger Woods, coming back from two surgeries in 15 months, trails fellow American JB Holmes by nine shots. At age 40, Woods had a promising start with four birdies in eight holes, but a wayward drive and poor chip led to a bogey on the ninth. Additional setbacks included another bogey on the 11th and double bogeys on the 16th and 18th, leaving him one stroke over par and ranked 898th in the world. Despite the challenges, Woods remains optimistic, expressing that he \"felt pretty good\" and is \"looking forward to the next few days\" at the event he hosts to support his charitable foundation.\n\nReflecting on his round, Woods commented to Sky Sports, \"I hit the ball in three bushes and the water, so it could have been something really good. I got off to a solid start but then made a few mistakes. I didn't play the par fives particularly well. If you drive great, you can take advantage of this golf course, but if not, you can end up in bushes or rocks and go sideways.\"\n\nWoods' first double bogey occurred when he pulled his approach from the center of the 16th fairway, leading to a difficult chip and an over-hit fourth shot that resulted in a six. On the par-four 18th, he pulled his drive into a lake, and despite hitting the pin with his fourth shot, he two-putted from 12 feet for another six. Nonetheless, Woods briefly tied for the lead at four under after three consecutive birdies from the sixth hole and finished the front nine at three-under-par 33. His birdie on the 15th offset a bogey on the 11th, but the two late double bogeys marred an otherwise encouraging performance.\n\nHolmes leads the 18-man tournament with an impressive eight-under-par 64, featuring seven birdies and an eagle. Close behind, Japan's Hideki Matsuyama is at seven under, with US Open winner Dustin Johnson at six under.

Detective Chief Inspector Jane Higham commented, \"This investigation is still in its early stages, and we are actively pursuing multiple lines of inquiry.\"", "Heinz Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party, voiced concerns about irregularities in postal vote handling, among other issues. \"This isn't about being sore losers,\" he asserted. \"It's about safeguarding the bedrock of democracy.\" The party's candidate narrowly lost to the former Green Party leader by just under 31,000 votes. Christian Neuwirth, spokesperson for Austria's constitutional court, confirmed the submission of a challenge. The court now has a four-week window to respond, which means if they take the full duration, their decision will be announced only two days before Alexander Van der Bellen, the poll winner, is set to be inaugurated.\n\nIs Europe swinging to the far right? Europe's rise in nationalism, country by country\u2014is populism threatening Europe's economies? The presidency, mostly a ceremonial role, could have propelled the Freedom Party towards success in the 2018 parliamentary elections. Analysts suggest that the legal challenge might reignite divisions from the vote, which highlighted Austria's internal rifts and again underscored Europe's struggles over the migrant crisis, economic management, and balancing national versus EU interests.\n\nMr. Van der Bellen emerged victorious the day after voting, with 50.3% of the votes compared to Mr. Hofer's 49.7%, despite early results showing Hofer slightly in the lead. The Freedom Party has pointed to many irregularities in their comprehensive 150-page appeal to the constitutional court. Mr. Strache cited evidence indicating that postal ballots were mishandled in 94 out of 117 district election offices, potentially impacting over 570,000 votes. Furthermore, they claimed that under-16s and foreigners participated in the voting.\n\n\"The scale of these irregularities is extraordinarily concerning and thus, I felt compelled to contest the result,\" Strache stated during a press conference. \"One doesn't need to be a conspiracy theorist to have serious doubts about this entire election. Without these irregularities, Mr. Hofer might have won.\"\n\nAccording to Bethany Bell of the BBC in Vienna, if the constitutional court deems Mr. Strache's evidence valid, potential outcomes could range from a partial recount to a new vote in the affected districts. The court must determine if laws were breached and whether any such breaches could have influenced the election's result.", "The report recommended separating the current duties of head of the legal system and president of the States. Political expert Dr. Adrian Lee, noting the unique dual role in the islands, pointed out that these were the only democratic areas where the person judging a case also had a hand in making the law. The Carswell Committee, which wrote the report, suggested that Jersey's Bailiff should step down as president of the States of Jersey and be replaced by an elected speaker. Lord Carswell explained that many international constitutional documents discourage judges from being involved with the legislature. He also highlighted that Jersey's Bailiff has had to dedicate more time to States work in recent years.\n\nDr. Lee, a former politics professor at Plymouth University, added that as the islands establish a stronger international presence, it's crucial for their legal and political systems to be transparent to outsiders. He pointed out that currently, it's unclear who represents the island\u2014whether it's the chief minister, the Lieutenant Governor, the Bailiff, or all three.\n\nA spokesperson for Guernsey's Policy Council mentioned they would follow Jersey's developments closely.

Sanaa is currently controlled by the Houthi rebel movement. The US government had sought Oman's assistance in locating these individuals. The Omani ministry did not disclose the identities of the Americans, but a Yemeni security official informed Reuters that they were held by the Houthi rebels. \"The three Americans were detained by Houthi-run security forces on suspicion of espionage,\" the official said via a phone call from Sanaa.\n\nEarlier this month, the US State Department reported that an American contractor for the United Nations, who was detained at Sanaa's airport the previous month, had passed away. John Hamen and a colleague, who is also believed to be American, were detained upon their arrival in Sanaa on a UN flight from Djibouti.\n\nIn September, two Americans who had been held hostage by the Houthis for several months were released and flown to safety in Oman, along with a British citizen and three Saudis. This development occurs as the Houthi rebels, who overthrew Yemen's government from Sanaa earlier this year, are confronted by an air and ground campaign conducted by a Saudi-led multinational coalition that is supported by the US. Oman, which is not part of this coalition, has actively participated in diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict. According to the UN, the fighting, which has been ongoing since late March, has resulted in at least 5,700 fatalities, approximately half of whom were civilians.", "The Russian Proton rocket, which failed in May with a Mexican payload, has delayed Inmarsat's third Global Xpress platform. The Proton launch is now scheduled for 28 August from Baikonur, Kazakhstan, at 17:44 local time (12:44 BST). Inmarsat, the world's largest mobile satellite services operator, mainly serves the shipping sector but also provides services to other groups needing telecommunications away from fixed lines, such as oil and gas installations, the aviation sector, armed forces, aid agencies, NGOs, and TV news crews.\n\nInmarsat's new \u00a31 billion GX network, the largest UK commercial space project currently underway, will feature three spacecraft for global coverage. Two satellites are already operational, covering Asia to the Americas. The upcoming launch will complete the network over the Pacific, ensuring seamless global coverage. This is crucial for the shipping and aviation sectors.\n\nInvestigators have pinpointed the cause of May's Proton failure. Vibration loosened bolts in the rocket's third stage, disrupting a turbopump and causing engine loss. Steps have been taken to prevent this issue in the future. The Proton has had six failures in five years, contributing to GX network delays of about a year.\n\nDespite these setbacks, Inmarsat's CTO, Michele Franci, expresses confidence in the upcoming launch, noting the extra caution taken after a return to flight. The new satellite is insured, and Inmarsat has ordered a fourth platform from Boeing as backup, available by mid-2016.\n\nThe GX network marks Inmarsat's shift to Ka frequencies for faster broadband speeds, 100 times quicker than their previous L-band satellites.

This project is the latest in a series of renewable energy initiatives planned for the area, which is owned by Buccleuch Estates. These efforts are part of a broader plan to transform the old opencast mine into the Glenmuckloch Energy Park. \n\nDetails about this project have come up in a scoping report for the pumped storage hydro scheme, which has been submitted to Dumfries and Galloway Council. Buccleuch Estates is teaming up with Hargreaves and 2020 Renewables to develop these plans. The project involves creating two reservoirs at different elevations, connected by a tunnel with a pump-turbine. The report explains: \"When there's extra electricity on the grid, the pump-turbines will lift water to the upper reservoir. When the grid needs more electricity, the pump-turbines will reverse and generate power by releasing water from the upper reservoir.\"\n\nIf it moves forward, the lower reservoir will be created from the existing opencast void, while the upper reservoir will be dug out at the top of Halfmerk Hill. The upper reservoir will be 22 meters (72 feet) deep and capable of holding 3.3 million cubic meters of water.\n\nThe effort to redevelop Glenmuckloch began after the surface mining company Aardvark TMC collapsed in 2013, resulting in a lack of funds to restore the site to its original state. Since then, Buccleuch Estates and Hargreaves have been working on a continuous restoration program alongside coal mining operations. Later this summer, two community wind turbines will be constructed to the west of the hydro site. Earlier this year, plans for an eight-turbine wind farm next to the mine were submitted to Dumfries and Galloway Council.", "East Sussex Healthcare Trust, which operates the Conquest Hospital in Hastings and Eastbourne District General Hospital, holds an \"inadequate\" rating. BBC South East Today has discovered that the trust has not shown improvement and is expected to be placed into special measures in an upcoming meeting on Friday. The trust stated that it awaits the publication of a report and declined to comment further. Currently, other trusts in special measures include East Kent Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Medway NHS Foundation Trust. The Maritime Hospital in Medway had to turn away ambulances earlier this week to alleviate pressure on its A&E department. The East Sussex trust was deemed \"inadequate\" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in March for not meeting government targets. In May, Eastbourne Borough Council criticized the trust, passing a vote of no confidence in its management. By July, the chief executive resigned, and the trust had to apologize for patients' details being found on the street. Leadership appears to be a major issue at this trust. The CQC\u2019s March report highlighted a \"disconnect between the trust board and its staff\" and a \"culture where staff were afraid to speak out.\" Despite the well-documented issues, there has been no significant progress in resolving them. The CQC has indicated that minimal improvement has occurred in recent months. Friday's meeting will provide an opportunity for stakeholders to discuss the path forward, though many within the wider NHS anticipate that special measures will be enforced on the trust. A trust spokesperson declined to comment on whether special measures would be imposed, stating: \"We are waiting for the publication of the CQC report next week, and until it is published and any recommendation is made, we are unable to provide further comment.\"", "Lisa Doughty, who is living with mesothelioma, attended Haggerston Girls\u2019 School in Hackney, East London during the 1980s. Now 47, Lisa recalls that the music desks were frequently coated with dust, potentially containing asbestos particles. Hackney Council has stated that they have not received a formal claim and cannot launch an investigation until one is filed. Lisa mentioned that she spent significant time in the music room every week for play rehearsals. \"We would sit on the desks and wipe off the white dust,\" she explained. \"There were two heavy doors at the music room's entrance that would constantly slam, shaking the room. The school was in a state of disrepair, so it's possible the dust fell from the ceiling when the doors closed.\" \n\nLisa believes that if it's proven that the music room was the source of her illness, \"many others might also be affected.\" She aims to raise awareness and urges any former students or teachers who might have been impacted to reach out. Her legal representatives at Slater and Gordon discovered that asbestos ceiling tiles were present during her time at the school and are considering further legal action. A Hackney Council spokesman noted, \"Asbestos was widely used historically in public and private buildings for its fire-resistant properties. Like many buildings of this age, Haggerston School has undergone regular condition checks and asbestos surveys and removals.\"\n\nEdmund Young, an asbestos-related disease expert from the law firm, added, \"Mesothelioma has typically been associated with industrial workers, but we are increasingly seeing cases among teachers and former students exposed to asbestos at school.\"", "The seasoned 29-year-old has joined a growing list of Ulster players committing their future to the team, following in the footsteps of Ruan Pienaar, Nick Williams, and Robbie Diack, who all recently extended their contracts.

Highlighting the team's potential and unfinished goals, particularly in winning trophies, Henry believes there is still much to achieve.

Both have that special something that elevates them above the ordinary and makes them exceptional. As for Singapore, it's no surprise it has become second only to Monaco for business dealings during a grand prix weekend. It's a destination that is immensely appealing. This widely recognized allure has turned it into one of the most sought-after races on the calendar. To begin with, the atmosphere is outstanding\u2014and, let's face it, that's what draws business visitors, not the challenge of racing on one of the longest F1 tracks in oppressive humidity. Singapore itself is a captivating place, with its position at the crossroads of Southeast Asia and its colonial history. But holding the race at night adds an extra layer of excitement. The track winds through the city center under bright lights, with Chinese lanterns adding splashes of color against the backdrop of the futuristic city skyline. As the sun goes down, the entire area seems to shimmer and sparkle briefly. Nighttime diminishes the tropical heat, creating a rich, luscious atmosphere. For those working at the race, there\u2019s also a surreal edge. Know someone who volunteers in sport and deserves acknowledgment for their work? Nominate them for recognition. With initial track sessions at dusk and both qualifying and racing taking place after dark, everyone stays on European time, waking up at 2 pm and working into the early hours before going to bed at 6 am. You can dine at hotel restaurants, some of which remain open all night during race weekend. Even better, visit an all-night hawkers' market, where a variety of stalls offer delicious, affordable local food, letting you soak in the ambience. Oh, and the track itself is impressive, too. While it isn\u2019t Spa or Suzuka, the Marina Bay Circuit presents its own unique challenges. With a long lap, a nearly two-hour race duration, bumps, 23 corners, and intense humidity, it\u2019s arguably the toughest grand prix on the calendar\u2014Malaysia being the only one that comes close.

Palace manager Frank de Boer noted that Zaha had been subjected to rough treatment during the match.", "The recent by-election in Dunfermline marked a significant shift in political dynamics. Cara Hilton, the newest Member of Scottish Parliament, emerged victorious, capturing the seat previously held by the SNP since their win in the 2011 Holyrood election. This election was prompted by the resignation of Bill Walker, an ex-SNP member who faced expulsion and imprisonment due to domestic abuse charges. Hilton emphasized that Dunfermline \"deserved better\" representation.\n\nNotably, the SNP clinched Dunfermline in 2011 with a narrow majority of 590 votes, but failed to maintain their hold this time around. Labour secured the seat with a striking majority of 2,873 votes, reflecting a significant 7% swing from the SNP. The Liberal Democrats and Conservatives followed in third and fourth places respectively. Hilton remarked, \u201cAfter the disgrace of Bill Walker, Dunfermline deserves better and I will ensure we deliver far superior governance than in the past.\u201d\n\nWith a turnout of 42.65%, Labour's majority was a decisive message ahead of the SNP's planned independence referendum next year. Hilton stressed, \u201cWe require a Scottish government that addresses the needs of Scots today, not one that merely promises future changes post-2016. Today, Dunfermline has conveyed to Bute House and Alex Salmond that it's time to focus on the pressing priorities of Scots, not on constitutional matters.\u201d\n\nThe by-election campaign was heavily influenced by local issues, such as proposed school closures, whereas the SNP leaned on national policies like the council tax freeze and removing tolls on the Forth Road Bridge. Despite their loss, SNP candidate Shirley-Anne Somerville expressed pride in their campaign efforts, particularly in supporting local schools. She voiced hopes for party unity to keep the schools in the Dunfermline constituency open.\n\nMeanwhile, the Liberal Democrats experienced an 8% decrease in votes. Their candidate, Susan Leslie, highlighted that the by-election was a triumph for women in Scottish politics, with four female candidates running robust campaigns focused on Dunfermline's concerns. Conservative candidate James Reekie, whose party saw a slight 1% increase in votes, concluded, \u201cWhen given the choice between Labour and the SNP, the people of Dunfermline opted for the Conservatives.\u201d", "Liam McDonald, 31, succeeds Marcus Bignot as Solihull's head coach, following Bignot's departure to League Two's Grimsby Town on 7 November.

Drones are used by police to capture footage in challenging areas like cliffs, but there are concerns that criminals are also using them. In November, a drone smuggling mobile phones, SIM cards, and drugs into HMP Manchester was recovered by guards. The Ministry of Justice reported nine drone attempts to infiltrate prisons in England and Wales in the first five months of 2015. A think tank warned that drones could be used by terrorists, and the UK Air Proximity Board noted four serious near-misses involving drones at UK airports last month.\n\nThe idea is that the birds would take down the drones, mistaking them for prey. However, Jemima Parry-Jones, director of the International Centre of Birds of Prey in Gloucestershire, called this idea a \"gimmick.\" She argued that eagles should not be flown in built-up areas and that grabbing drones with rotating blades could be dangerous for the birds. She suggested that police should heed expert advice and warned of the dangers by asking, \"If you don't believe us, try putting your own fingers into the propeller of a reasonably sized drone and see what happens.\"\n\nAn RSPCA spokesman stated they don't oppose police training eagles to tackle drones in principle but have concerns about the birds' welfare. There is currently not enough information to make an informed comment. A Met Police spokesman said they are interested in all innovative ideas and will be examining the Dutch police's use of eagles.", "Back in 2013, the coast of Porlock Bay saw the inception of an exciting initiative aimed at boosting local employment and revitalizing the area's image: oyster farming. Fast forward to today, and this venture has not only thrived but has also achieved the coveted highest quality rating for its oysters, which are now set to be sold locally. \n\nRoger Hall from the Porlock Futures Community Interest Company hailed the effort as a \"brilliantly successful trial.\" Utilizing oysters from Morecambe Bay in Lancashire, the team tested whether these shellfish could flourish in Porlock's waters. \"We've demonstrated that our oysters not only grow but also earn the highest Class A classification for cleanliness,\" Mr. Hall proudly shared. \"What began as a mere intriguing concept has evolved into 70 trestles teeming with thousands of pristine oysters, ready to grace the tables of local restaurants.\"\n\nThe project's achievements have garnered significant support, earning a \u00a375,000 grant from the Power To Change fund and more than \u00a365,000 in local community contributions. David Salter from the Community Interest Company reflected on the growth, stating, \"While we may not have the quickest growing site in the South West, we aim to sell around 30,000 oysters this year. By next year, that number will rise to 80,000, and within four to five years, it'll skyrocket to 500,000.\" He added, \"This venture is really taking off. In a few years, you'll see 500 trestles out here.\"\n\nThe future looks bright for Porlock Bay's oyster farming, a testament to community effort and innovative thinking.", "Phillips, who has played for Wales 94 times, shared his views amid criticism of coach Rob Howley for not bringing new faces into the team. As Wales gears up to play France, it's noted that only three new players have been capped since the 2015 World Cup. Phillips explained, \"You can't just play young players because they are young.\" Since 2015, only Ellis Jenkins, Cory Hill, and Sam Davies have made their senior debuts.\n\nIn the lead-up to the final Six Nations game in Paris, some have urged Howley to look to the future by introducing new talent. However, Howley has decided to stick with the same team that recently defeated Ireland. This decision comes despite having several uncapped players such as Olly Cracknell, Rory Thornton, Owen Williams, Steffan Evans, Ashton Hewitt, Aled Davies, and Thomas Young in the squad.\n\nPhillips supports Howley's choices, arguing that young players must prove they are ready. \"There are a few guys on the verge, but they still need to learn,\" Phillips told BBC Radio Wales. \"They are young and developing, but their time will come. They need to improve in training and prove to Rob that they deserve to be in the starting lineup.\"\n\nPhillips believes Howley has made the right call against France, emphasizing that the best players should wear the international jersey based on merit, not potential. He added, \"Future development is important, but it needs to be approached in a structured way. Given the circumstances, they've focused on getting wins and backing the current players.

Last month, the state took a progressive step by implementing a human rights measure that prohibits gender identity discrimination in public facilities. In recent weeks, two states have taken further strides by passing laws that ensure transgender students have equal access to gender-segregated facilities. However, in Arizona, the Republican-majority legislature has proposed a bill that would criminalize the use of public bathrooms and changing rooms that do not correspond with the gender listed on one's birth certificate. Violators could face penalties, including six months in prison.\n\n\"If you present as a man and live as a man, you should be able to use men\u2019s facilities,\" argued Dru Levasseur, a transgender rights lawyer with Lambda Legal. In contrast, the bill's sponsor, Republican lawmaker John Kavanagh, expressed concerns about potential misuse. \"Criminals might exploit the situation to expose themselves to children of the opposite gender,\" he stated, according to the Associated Press. \"This legislation is simply about upholding societal norms: men are men and women are women,\" Mr. Kavanagh continued. Yet, he mentioned that law enforcement could exercise discretion in cases such as women using men's restrooms to avoid long queues.\n\nOn Wednesday, amid a hearing filled with transgender activists, Mr. Kavanagh agreed to delay the vote on the bill. Opponents argue the legislation would force transgender individuals to disclose their identities, increasing their risk of harassment. \"Most transgender people aim to pass through public spaces unnoticed,\" said activist Erica Keppler. \"This bill would criminalize us.\" Advocates also point out the difficulties many transgender people face in amending their birth certificates, which often require proof of gender reassignment surgery\u2014a process not permitted in states like Idaho and Ohio, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nMeanwhile, 16 US states already have laws in place to protect against discrimination based on gender identity, although these protections vary in coverage.

They aimed to create an experience that would help the children empathize deeply with those they were raising money for.\n\nIn a lively statement, the school declared: \"We sought to craft a scenario that would truly let the children walk in the shoes of those we aim to support.\" They also assured that, moving forward, any similar activities would first have the green light from a member of the senior leadership team. \"Our future endeavors will be designed to foster empathy and understanding, ensuring the children learn in a stress-free and joyful way.\"\n\nThe school acknowledged that their message could have been conveyed in a more suitable manner and sincerely apologized to both parents and children. This engaging program was part of Christian Aid's inspiring refugee week, a cause the school passionately fundraises for.

An online fundraising campaign initiated by beautician Katie Cutler amassed \u00a3330,135. Richard Gatiss, 25, from Gateshead, admitted to assault with intent to rob at Newcastle Crown Court. Following the sentencing, Mr. Barnes remarked that the sentence was \"just about the right length of time\" and expressed his hope that Gatiss would use his time in prison for introspection. \"I hope while he's in prison he'll do some thinking and when he comes out he'll do something useful,\" he stated.\n\nGatiss, of Split Crow Road, was apprehended after police recovered DNA evidence from a pocket on Mr. Barnes\u2019 jacket. It was revealed in court that Gatiss had been desperate for money to purchase legal highs but fled empty-handed when Mr. Barnes called for help. Judge Paul Sloan QC characterized Gatiss' behavior as \"despicable and opportunistic,\" noting that he had targeted Mr. Barnes due to his vulnerability. Mr. Barnes has lived with disabilities from birth because his mother contracted German measles during her pregnancy. He is visually impaired and stands 4ft 6in (1.21m) tall.\n\nAfter the hearing, Mr. Barnes, accompanied by the 21-year-old Miss Cutler, commented, \"I'm pleased with the sentence, and I believe four years is the appropriate duration.

It's unfortunate that he reached the point of committing such an act\u2014it could have happened to anyone, and they might not have recovered from the incident. But I've moved on,\" he added. Holding back tears, Miss Cutler stated, \"It's difficult for me to speak about Richard as it wasn't me who was attacked, but I just hope he receives the help he needs. I'm just glad that something good has come from this, and we can move forward.\"\n\nWhile on remand, Gatiss was held in segregation for his safety. Jamie Adams, Gatiss' defense attorney, called it \"an awful case,\" noting that the widespread publicity complicated maintaining a \"proper perspective on the sentencing.\" Adams also mentioned that Gatiss faced \"some pretty awful double-standard behavior\" from other inmates while on the prison bus to court. \"Life is not easy for him. He is going to remain in the public eye for a long time, and he understands that.\" Karl Gatiss, Richard's father, declined to comment on the sentence outside court but advocated for a ban on legal highs.

In response, government officials are intensifying efforts to combat misinformation that draws them to Canada. Nearly 60,000 Haitians were granted temporary protection in the US following the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, but this protection will end in January 2018. Canada ended its protected status for Haitians last year, and in 2016, about 50% of Haitian asylum claims were rejected. \n\nOn Monday, federal Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale warned against illegal border crossings, stating that they are neither desirable nor productive. Canadian diplomatic staff in the US, led by Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen, are working to dispel myths about Canada's residency guarantees. Federal Liberal MP Emmanuel Dubourg, who speaks Creole and has Haitian roots, is engaging with Haitian media in American cities like Miami and New York to address these misconceptions.\n\nOver the weekend, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau emphasized Canada's welcoming nature but stressed adherence to immigration laws, stating that irregular entry into Canada is not advantageous and that strict rules apply. Opposition politicians have criticized Trudeau for his government's refugee-friendly stance, arguing it has contributed to the surge of migrants.\n\nSince January, 7,500 migrants have crossed illegally into Canada, mainly into Quebec, where migrant numbers skyrocketed from 781 in June to 2,996 in July. The federal government has increased staff to help process claims, currently facing a five-month wait time, to determine the eligibility of these migrants for refugee status.", "A team from University College London conducted a study involving paediatricians across 177 hospitals in England and Wales, revealing significant gaps in their knowledge regarding the identification of underweight children and the recognition of serious complications related to eating disorders. Surprisingly, this lack of expertise was evident even among clinicians who had prior experience treating children with eating disorders. In response, the Royal College of Paediatrics is undertaking efforts to improve training in this area.\n\nDr. Lee Hudson, leading the study from the Institute of Child Health at University College London, observed that more children under the age of thirteen are now presenting with eating disorders than with meningitis, largely due to the success of vaccination programs. This shift in the prevalence of childhood illnesses could be a contributing factor to the observed deficiencies in the ability to identify underweight children and recognize the associated medical issues, Dr. Hudson noted.\n\nThe study involved questioning one on-call paediatrician from every hospital that provides acute inpatient care for children. They were interviewed via phone regarding their methods for determining if a child is underweight and the clinical examinations they would perform to detect severe or life-threatening complications. The results were concerning: only half of the paediatricians interviewed would use Body Mass Index (BMI) to assess whether older children or adolescents were underweight, as recommended by international guidelines. Furthermore, a mere 20% would adjust these assessments using appropriate cut-off points for children. There was also a notable lack of awareness concerning the symptoms and signs of complications in severely underweight children.\n\nParticularly alarming was the finding that only 13% of the paediatricians knew to look for a specific danger sign that checks if the heart is functioning correctly, a critical issue reported in the Archives of Diseases in Childhood. Furthermore, the doctors demonstrated poor knowledge of the severe complications that might arise from initiating nutrition in severely malnourished children or those who have not eaten for an extended period.\n\nDr. Hudson clarified that these deficiencies should not be seen as criticisms of the doctors, as eating disorders often present with non-specific symptoms. Instead, these findings highlight crucial gaps in paediatric training. He also emphasized the inconsistency in services available for children with eating disorders across the country. Given that these paediatricians are likely to be the first to assess such children, especially during out-of-office hours, their ability to recognize dangerously underweight children and severe complications is crucial.\n\nDr. Hudson further mentioned that previous research indicates that one-third of underweight children present with life-threatening conditions. Prof Russell Viner, a co-author of the study and a member of the Royal College of Paediatrics Nutrition Committee, acknowledged the identified need for training related to eating disorders and underweight issues. He added that training on adolescent health is being refreshed, and in collaboration with the Department of Health and the Royal College of Psychiatry, a new training program focusing on mental health in adolescents is being developed.", "Couples can now have two children, according to a statement from the Communist Party. The controversial one-child policy, introduced nationwide in 1979, aimed to slow population growth and is estimated to have prevented around 400 million births. However, concerns about China's aging population led to calls for change. Couples who violated the one-child policy faced punishments ranging from fines and job loss to forced abortions. Over time, the policy was relaxed in some provinces as experts highlighted rising social costs and decreasing worker numbers.\n\nThe decision to allow families to have two children is intended \"to improve the balanced development of population\" and address the aging population, according to a statement from the Communist Party's Central Committee, reported by Xinhua News Agency on Thursday. Currently, about 30% of China's population is over the age of 50, with the total population around 1.36 billion.\n\nTwo years ago, the Communist Party started easing national rules, allowing couples in which at least one partner is an only child to have a second child. Despite the recent relaxation, many couples may still choose to have only one child, as one-child families have become the social norm. Critics argue that even a two-child policy won't significantly boost the birth rate, reports the BBC's John Sudworth. Additionally, women who wish to have more than two children will still face state control over their fertility. \"As long as the quotas and system of surveillance remain, women still do not enjoy reproductive rights,\" Maya Wang from Human Rights Watch told AFP.\n\nI was born in 1979, the year the one-child policy was implemented, and my birth was only allowed through the kindness of officials who overlooked the used-up baby quotas in my parents' work unit. My mother, however, had to endure two abortions because of this policy and still mourns the loss of what 'Number Two' and 'Number Three' might have been like.\n\nStuart Gietel-Basten, an associate professor of social policy at the University of Oxford, argues in The Conversation that the reform will do little to change China's population dynamics and is more of a \"pragmatic response to an unpopular policy that made no sense.\" The announcement in China coincided with the final day of a summit of the Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee, known as the fifth plenum, where growth targets and the next five-year plan were also discussed.", "At 33, the world\u2019s top-ranked Test bowler, James Anderson, is set to miss Lancashire's next two County Championship games. England's four-match series against Pakistan kicks off at Lord's on 14 July.

British Gas's new rates start on March 16, with EDF's change coming eight days later. These reductions will benefit customers on standard domestic gas tariffs. Britain's six major energy suppliers have faced pressure to pass on savings to customers after wholesale gas prices dropped 57% in the last year. E.On first announced a 5.1% cut this year, followed by similar reductions from SSE, Scottish Power, and Npower.\n\nRichard Lloyd, executive director at the consumer group Which?, noted: \"The big suppliers all making small cuts despite falling wholesale prices raises questions about market competition.\" British Gas, owned by Centrica, said its 6.8 million dual-fuel customers would save an average of \u00a331 annually from the 5.1% cut. Customers on \"fix and fall\" tariffs will also benefit. EDF stated that about 900,000 of its customers would save \u00a331 annually and added that none of its fixed deals have exit fees. Beatrice Bigois, managing director at EDF, confirmed: \"Our prices are under constant review, and today's announcement reflects the drop in wholesale gas costs.\"\n\nCentrica's Mark Hodges, UK and Ireland energy supply CEO, said: \"Competitive pricing is key to retaining existing customers and attracting new ones in this tough market.\" However, experts warn that \"standard\" tariffs remain among the most expensive, so consumers can still save by shopping around.\n\nRachel Fletcher, Ofgem's senior partner for consumers and competition, commented: \"These price cuts benefit loyal customers, but larger savings up to \u00a3300 are available by switching from a standard to a fixed tariff.\" Critics also point out that the industry has not reduced electricity tariffs despite falling wholesale costs. Jefferies energy analysts noted: \"Electricity tariffs remain unchanged despite a 30% drop in wholesale electricity prices since August 2014, likely due to increased environmental costs impacting electricity more than gas and higher network charges.\" British Gas stated it could not reduce electricity prices due to rising network delivery costs, noting that wholesale costs only account for a third of electricity bills.\n\nEnergy and Climate Change Secretary Amber Rudd stressed that more needs to be done.

If there were an election tomorrow, Labour would be crushed, and that's a wake-up call for our party.\" He said Corbyn was \"fooling himself\" if he thought they were close to winning. If Labour kept going like this, Smith warned, they\u2019d be down to just 140 MPs. Right now, they have 230, to the Conservatives' 329. \"If Jeremy thinks we're winning, he\u2019s kidding himself, and neither the party nor the country needs to believe that,\" he said, claiming Labour was \"stuck\" and facing \"Groundhog Day\" if Corbyn won.

When asked if he'd run for leader again if Corbyn wins, he didn't give a straight answer, calling it a \"hypothetical question for way down the line.\" A spokesperson for Corbyn's campaign shot back: \"You know things are going bad for Owen Smith's desperate campaign when he starts going after Labour members instead of the Tories. The inconvenient truth for Owen Smith is that Labour was ahead of the Tories in May's local elections; we've won every by-election under Jeremy's leadership, and we\u2019ve also won mayoral races in Bristol, London, Liverpool, and Salford.

GCHQ said this data is crucial for intelligence work. However, the ECHR\u2019s Article 8 guarantees everyone's right to privacy and dictates that any data collection must be legal and necessary.\n\nGraham Smith from Bird & Bird highlighted that much of the data gathering was done under an old law, Section 94 of the Telecommunications Act 1984, which gave no clear indication it could be used this way. He pointed out that while operational secrecy is necessary, the laws governing agency powers should be transparent.\n\nIn February 2015, official guidelines for lawful data collection were introduced, which the spy agencies started following later that year. These included rules on how to handle the collected data properly. Before this, the tribunal found that the agencies' data-gathering practices didn't comply with Article 8 and were \"unlawful.\"\n\nThe Home Office emphasized the importance of these powers for national security and was pleased that current practices were deemed lawful.

The incident prompted a five-day hearing to determine if his death could have been prevented. Some players providing testimony during the inquest faced accusations of dishonesty, claiming an inability to recall many of the day's events.\n\nThe New South Wales Coroner's Court inquest, which commenced on Monday, gathered testimonies from players such as Brad Haddin, Doug Bollinger, and David Warner. The court's focus was to assess whether Hughes, representing South Australia in a Sheffield Shield game against New South Wales, had been intentionally targeted with short-pitch bowling or subjected to distressing remarks. There was also speculation about whether a bowler had threatened Hughes with the words, \"I'm going to kill you,\" prior to the fatal injury.\n\nHughes' parents expressed their frustration by walking out, especially as the family's counsel, Greg Melick SC, critiqued the players for frequently responding with \"no recollection\" or \"I can't recall\" to numerous questions. \"Ultimately, there was a strategy involving sledging and short-pitched deliveries aimed at Phillip Hughes, escalating the risk of injury,\" said Mr. Melick. He emphasized that delivering nine consecutive short-pitched balls targeting the leg stump or body of the batsman was excessive.\n\nAllegations of fabricated evidence were firmly denied by the counsel representing Cricket Australia and its players. Hughes' siblings also left the inquest as the players' statements were defended. Kristina Stern SC, the counsel assisting the coroner, argued that concerns about sledging and short balls were irrelevant and should not influence the findings.\n\nNSW State Coroner Michael Barnes is expected to announce his conclusion from the inquest on 4 November. An earlier report, commissioned by Cricket Australia, recommended the mandatory use of protective helmets for batsmen facing fast- and medium-pace bowling. However, it noted that even helmets adhering to the latest safety standards would not have saved Hughes' life.", "The 19 individuals were released after mediation by South Sudan's government. This is the first release group since around 125 children were kidnapped in the cross-border raid. The attack was carried out by members of the Murle community, who have previously been accused of stealing livestock and children to raise as their own. In total, more than 200 individuals from Ethiopia's Nuer community in the western Gambella province were killed during the raid on April 15. Ethiopian forces crossed into South Sudan, surrounding villages where the children were being held. The children were eventually released without any combat after South Sudanese officials negotiated with the abductors, according to the Ethiopian News Agency. Negotiations will continue until all the children are freed. South Sudan\u2019s ambassador to Ethiopia, James Pitia Morgan, emphasized that the children must be rescued and reunited with their families, and the stolen cattle should be returned to their rightful owners. Ethiopia shares a long border with South Sudan, and cross-border raids between the Murle and Nuer communities are not unusual.

This situation mirrors that of Nina Davuluri, an Indian-American who faced racial abuse after her Miss America win but received strong support from the Indian community.\n\nDespite facing criticism due to her father's Indian heritage, Yoshikawa received support from those who believe her win was deserved. Some Indians on social media urged the Japanese to move past outdated views. One commentator even noted that, like Gautam Buddha, Yoshikawa represented a significant Indian influence in Japan. \n\nThe primary complaint against her win appears to be concerns over \"purity.\" However, many argue that such debates are outdated in a globalized world, with one Twitter user asserting that \"Talent cannot be controlled or ruled by caste, color, gender, or country of origin.\"\n\nAn avid kick-boxer and qualified elephant trainer, Yoshikawa hopes to change perceptions. \"Abroad, no one questions my heritage; as Miss Japan, I aim to bring the same mindset here,\" she stated.

The proposed laws ignited intense debates within the parliament, with two opposition parties fiercely contesting against the implementation of castration. Human rights organizations voiced strong objections, contending that answering violence with violence will not foster peace. The Indonesian Doctors Association vehemently opposed the idea, asserting that administering chemical castration, which involves injecting convicts with female hormones, breaches their professional ethics and advising their members to abstain from participation. Although used in varied places such as Poland, South Korea, Russia, and some US states, and even voluntary in UK prisons, the treatment remains contentious.\n\nThe new Indonesian laws empower judges to impose the death penalty, life imprisonment, electronic tracking, and a mandatory 10-year minimum sentence for child sex crimes. Human rights advocates, including the National Commission for Women (NCW), criticized these laws, urging annual reviews to evaluate their effectiveness as deterrents to crime. Azriana, head of the NCW, noted that countries utilizing chemical castration have not witnessed a drop in child sexual crimes and argued that resources would be better spent on victim support services. \n\nDr. Yohana Susana Yembise, Indonesia\u2019s Minister for Women Empowerment and Child Protection, expressed a solemn hope that these severe measures would achieve their intended purpose. \"Now we have the harshest punishments: the death penalty, life in prison, chemical castration, public naming of perpetrators, and electronic tagging.

Just last month, British tourist Kleyo De Abreu tragically died in a bungee jump off a bridge near Granada, in southern Spain, after hitting the bridge wall. According to a police spokesman, the latest \"terrible accident\" might have been due to carelessness, though it's still not clear what exactly went wrong. The teenager was doing a type of bungee jump called \"puenting,\" which involves diving with two cords and then swinging beneath the bridge or viaduct. \n\nBungee jumping has gotten super popular in Spain recently, both with locals and tourists. People love the stunning spots in rural Andalusia in the south, or in Cantabria and the Pyrenees up north.

We're here to support her family in any way we can.\"", "Archaeologists with the National Trust for Scotland (NTS) discovered a walled enclosure beneath the lawn in Fountain Court at a South Ayrshire castle. According to NTS, the enclosure likely served as a kitchen garden between 1733 and 1782. In the late 18th century, a trend emerged to build new walled gardens away from the house, allowing the old site to be landscaped for better views from the castle. Derek Alexander, head of archaeological services for NTS, remarked: \"While it was indicated on the estate map, we didn't know any part of it still existed beneath Fountain Court's pristine turf until now. This project allowed us to uncover a hidden piece of Culzean's history, and once the lawn is re-seeded, I doubt the gardeners will want us digging more holes!\" The garden is believed to have been created by Sir John Kennedy of Culzean, 2nd Baronet, in 1733, and it appears on an estate map of Culzean drawn by John Foulis in 1755. The garden was abandoned in 1782, and its walls were demolished by workers under Robert Adam as part of extensive improvements around the castle. Current drainage work at Fountain Court aims to prepare the area for hosting large public events.", "In March, a historic milestone was reached a full nine months ahead of schedule, marking a pivotal moment after decades of global endeavor and investment aimed at providing antiretroviral drugs to those in need, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Back in 2000, when the UN first established its goals to combat HIV, fewer than 700,000 individuals were receiving these essential medications. Fast forward to today, as highlighted in a new UN Aids report, the global fight against HIV has successfully prevented 30 million new HIV infections and nearly 8 million AIDS-related deaths since the start of the millennium. Over these years, annual new HIV infections have dropped from 2.6 million to 1.8 million, and AIDS-related deaths have decreased from 1.6 million to 1.2 million. Global investment in HIV has also surged dramatically, rising from \u00a33.1 billion ($4.8 billion) in 2000 to over \u00a313 billion ($20 billion) in 2014. According to UN Aids, focused efforts over the upcoming five years could potentially eradicate the AIDS epidemic by 2030. \n\nHowever, some areas lag behind. Awareness of HIV status remains a significant barrier to accessing treatment, and this gap hinders progress. Treatment access for children has also been slower compared to adults, but recent improvements are promising. The fraction of children with HIV receiving antiretroviral therapy nearly doubled from 14% in 2010 to 32% in 2014, yet it still lags behind adult coverage. Despite the reduction in new HIV infections, the numbers remain troublingly high, maintaining the epidemic's burden. In 2014, sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 66% of all new HIV infections, with an estimated 25.8 million people living with HIV in this region alone, out of a global total of 36.9 million.\n\nThis year marks a transition from the Millennium Development Goals to the broader Sustainable Development Goals. Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations, stated, \"The world has delivered on halting and reversing the AIDS epidemic. Now we must commit to ending the AIDS epidemic as part of the Sustainable Development Goals.\" The report emphasizes that the next five years are crucial and advises a surge in early investment to accelerate efforts towards the ambitious goal of ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030.", "Standing at just 3ft 7in, James from Colwyn Bay is no ordinary individual. Born with diastrophic dysplasia, a form of dwarfism, James has faced and conquered numerous challenges. At the tender age of three, he underwent a significant neck operation, and by seven, he was using Ilizarov frames to straighten his legs. Despite these hurdles, James now leads a fulfilling life and is set to carry the Olympic torch through Rhos-on-Sea during its journey through Wales from May 25-30.\n\nJames, now 23, was nominated for this honor by a friend he met at the 2008 Beijing Paralympics through the British Council\u2019s young advocate program. Bursting with excitement, James said, \"It\u2019s an amazing privilege. The guy who nominated me is someone who sees me as an inspiration, and we struck up a close bond in Beijing.

Sales volumes in Scotland grew by 0.7% compared to the UK's 0.8% increase. The Scottish Retail Sales Index further indicated that annual sales volumes in Scotland surged by 2.7%, while the value saw a marginal rise of 0.1%.\n\nDavid Lonsdale, Director of the Scottish Retail Consortium, noted that the return to growth is encouraging but highlighted the persistent fragility in consumer confidence impacting retailers. He urged the incoming Scottish government to prioritize policies that foster investment and expansion within the sector. \n\nMr. Lonsdale remarked, \"The prospects for retailers are ultimately determined by the state of the economy and their ability to adapt and seize emerging opportunities. Our new MSPs can assist by directing their collective efforts towards ensuring that the retail industry, as Scotland's largest private-sector employer, is well-positioned to invest, expand, and create jobs.\"\n\nEuan Murray, representing Barclays Corporate Banking in Scotland, attributed the \"measured increase\" in first-quarter sales volume primarily to food sales, a shift from the previous three months. He observed, \"Non-food retailers continue to benefit from a robust online presence, with value-conscious consumers increasingly comparing prices online to secure the best deals. We anticipate the significance of online retail will continue to grow.\"\n\nRecent industry statistics indicated a mixed performance for Scotland's retailers in March. The SRC-KPMG monitor reported a 1.3% decline in total sales for the five weeks leading up to April 2 compared to the same period last year. While the non-food sector saw strong performance in household goods such as furniture and flooring, the fashion and footwear category experienced its sharpest decline since May of the previous year, influenced by the early Easter holiday.", "Ogbonna, the younger brother of the iconic former Arsenal striker Nwankwo Kanu, shared with BBC Sport that Kanu is thriving after his recent operation. \"We reached the decision for the procedure during his routine annual check-up,\" Ogbonna explained. \"We are immensely grateful to God that all went smoothly and he's in perfect health.\"\n\nThe family extends heartfelt thanks to Nigerians and Kanu's global fanbase for their prayers and well wishes. Kanu's journey with heart health began in November 1996 when he had surgery to correct a faulty aortic valve. After a yearlong recovery, he made a powerful return to the pitch with Inter Milan and, by February 1999, had joined the ranks of Premier League giants Arsenal.\n\nInspired by his own medical challenges, Kanu established a foundation dedicated to building five hospitals across Africa, aimed at diagnosing and treating heart disease, and providing life-saving surgeries.\n\nIn a fitting tribute to his remarkable career and contributions, the Nigerian government recently named Kanu among the 100 most distinguished Nigerians at a centenary celebration marking the unification of north and south Nigeria.\n\nKanu retired from international football at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. His illustrious career includes leading Nigeria to victory in the Fifa Under-17 World Cup in 1993 and clinching the football gold medal at the 1996 Olympics.

This effort forms part of the 11th annual economic survey of the UK fishing fleet, with the results scheduled for release next year. Tom Pickerell from Seafish highlighted the significance of this initiative, stating, \"This is an immensely important exercise that allows us to gain a comprehensive understanding of the industry. Consequently, it aids us in informing key decision-makers at both national and European levels. We strongly encourage skippers and boat owners across the UK to participate by speaking with our researchers. Their input will enable us to present the most accurate picture possible and support the development of better-informed policies.\"", "Carwyn Scott-Howell was on vacation with his family when authorities reported that he fell 160 feet (49 meters) after straying off the ski trail. His family described him in a statement as a \"very competent skier and snowboarder.\" They explained that the family had been skiing together when Carwyn's sister \"lost her ski on a jump\" and Carwyn skied ahead. The accident occurred in Flaine, 38 miles northwest of Chamonix. Through the Foreign Office, the family issued a statement calling Carwyn an \"adorable, caring person\" who had learned to ski at the age of three. The statement also detailed how the family became separated during their final ski run of the day on Friday afternoon. It read: \"The family were all enjoying their last ski run over the small jumps and bumps at the side of the slope, when Carwyn's sister lost her ski on a jump, and at this point, Carwyn skied ahead. \"The family cannot express their overwhelming sense of devastation and the vast emptiness in their hearts. \"They want to thank all their friends and family for their support and the extensive assistance from the British Consulate.\" Police chief Patrick Poirot, who leads the mountain rescue team in nearby Annecy, stated that police believe the boy got lost after becoming separated from his parents and skied in the wrong direction. He said: \"He left the designated ski slope, likely skied to the top of a cliff, stopped, removed his skis, walked a little, and then fell.\" The family resides on a farm in the small village of Talybont-on-Usk in the Brecon Beacons, where Carwyn's parents, Ceri and Rhys, operate an award-winning produce business and rent holiday cottages. Liam Fitzpatrick, an independent county councillor for the village, expressed the community's shock, saying: \"He was seven years old; it's horrendous. A tragic, tragic accident. \"The village is small, and everyone knows each other, especially his parents, who are well-known due to their business. \"There will be immense support for them when they return. The community will be ready to assist them in any way possible. \"It's impossible to fully grasp what they are enduring at this moment.\"", "Detailed information about player signings confirmed in the months of May, June, July, and August can be found on the respective pages devoted to each month.
