["The extensive damage caused by flooding in Newton Stewart is still being evaluated. Repair efforts are underway in Hawick, while numerous roads in Peeblesshire are still under water. Disruption to train services on the west coast mainline is anticipated due to damage at the Lamington Viaduct. Flooding in Newton Stewart from the overflowing River Cree led to significant impacts on businesses and residents. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited the affected area to assess the damage, particularly noting the breach of a retaining wall on Victoria Street. Jeanette Tate, owner of the Cinnamon Cafe, praised the multi-agency response to the flood but expressed the need for more preventative measures to avoid future incidents.

However, both groups have arranged for replacement coaches and will start their tour of the north coast a little later than planned. Police are seeking information about the incident. Inspector David Gibson mentioned, \"It seems like the fire began under one of the buses before spreading to the second one. While the exact cause is still being investigated, it is believed that the fire was set intentionally.\"", "John Edward Bates, previously residing in Spalding, Lincolnshire, but now living in London, is facing a total of 22 charges, which include two allegations of indecency with a minor. The 67-year-old stands accused of committing these crimes between March 1972 and October 1989. Mr. Bates has refuted all accusations brought against him. Grace Hale, representing the prosecution, informed the jury that the claims of sexual misconduct were presented by four male individuals and center around Mr. Bates' time as a scout leader in South Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire. Hale stated, \"The defendant maintains that there is no truth to these allegations. He asserts that these individuals have concocted false stories and are not telling the truth.\" The prosecution alleged that Mr. Bates lured a 15-year-old to his residence under the guise of showing him cinematic footage from scout outings, but then exposed him to explicit adult videos, which led to the young boy being subjected to sexual abuse, causing confusion and fear. According to Hale, the victim remembers multiple instances where the defendant engaged in sexual acts with him, either in Mr. Bates' car or at his residence. Another young boy was reportedly taken by Mr. Bates on a trip to London at the age of 13 or 14, and after visiting pubs, he was allegedly sexually assaulted. Mrs. Hale also mentioned that two boys associated with the Spalding group have come forward with similar allegations of being sexually abused.

By exploiting poorly protected signals, attackers could manipulate PCs as if they were physically present in front of them. Researchers discovered that radio signals sent by wireless mice were often unencrypted, allowing attackers to send unencrypted traffic to the computer's dongle, mimicking keystrokes. In contrast, signals from wireless keyboards were encrypted to prevent eavesdropping or spoofing.\n\nMarc Newlin and Balint Seeber from Bastille demonstrated how simple it was to spoof signals from vulnerable mice using inexpensive equipment, enabling attackers to send commands and take control of target machines at distances up to 180m. Despite efforts by some hardware makers like HP, Lenovo, Amazon, and Dell to provide firmware updates for vulnerable mice, some devices remain insecure with no available fixes.\n\nThe findings underscore the importance of addressing vulnerabilities in wireless devices, as companies often focus on securing physical devices but overlook the risks associated with radio transmission.", "Administrators at Murray and Burrell in Galashiels confirmed the redundancy of 38 staff last week due to adverse trading conditions as the business went into administration.

These images were obtained through a controversial sting operation conducted by News Group Newspapers Limited. Despite the tabloid's false allegations of a Nazi-themed orgy, Mr Mosley successfully sued for breach of privacy and won damages. The High Court determined that the story was not in the public interest and awarded Mr Mosley \u00a360,000 in damages.\n\nNow, in his fight against Google, Mr Mosley argues that the tech giant should comply with the law and court decisions rather than acting based on its own rules. Google's defense claims that Mr Mosley no longer has a reasonable expectation of privacy regarding these images, but Mr Mosley insists that the private activities shown in the photos were harmless, consensual, and intended to remain private. While Google has stated that it is willing to remove specific URLs upon request, it refuses to entirely remove the images from its search results.\n\nDuring the court proceedings, Google's barrister acknowledged that removing the images would not be burdensome, but maintained that Google is not the publisher of this private information. The defense aims to prove that Mr Mosley's claim is not valid based on the argument that he no longer has a justified expectation of privacy regarding the images. The outcome of this legal battle is expected to be determined by the court on Thursday.", "Looking at the situation from a different angle, Dragons forwards coach Ceri Jones expressed disappointment regarding the injury affecting the Bath-born player, 28, who has proven his worth with 36 appearances since moving from Wasps in 2015.

Daniel Ortega won the election with a significant majority, receiving 72.5% of the vote, while his closest competitor got 14.2%. The State Department expressed concerns over the lack of international observers, which they believe undermined the election's credibility. They are urging the Nicaraguan government to respect democratic principles, including freedom of the press and human rights. Ortega's victory was expected due to his popular social programs and lack of strong political opponents. Despite celebrations by his supporters, opposition groups labeled the election a sham. Some alleged a high voter abstention rate, but electoral authorities reported turnout at 65.8%. Ortega's wife, Rosario Murillo, might become vice president and potentially succeed him in the future.

Finance Minister Jane Hutt championed the move, touting its potential to bring about immediate positive impacts in the region. However, Plaid Cymru dismissed the package as \"completely inadequate,\" while the Conservatives proposed that the funds be channeled to council tax payers instead.\n\nFollowing weeks of negotiations, Labour and the Lib Dems struck a budget deal on Friday, marking the end of exhaustive discussions between government officials and opposition parties. Navigating the complex political landscape of the assembly, where Labour holds 30 out of 60 seats, the party must secure backing from at least one other group to push through its spending plans.\n\nThe windfall, to be spread over the course of two years, was born from meticulous budget deliberations and funds freed up due to a council tax freeze in England.

Moreover, \u00a39m will be allocated towards improving school infrastructure, matched by the same sum dedicated to delivering 130 new homes.\n\nUnderlining its commitment to bolster economic development, the government has slated \u00a33.5m to enhance infrastructure in potential enterprise zones across Wales, where businesses are slated to receive support in spurring growth. First Minister Carwyn Jones has rebuffed suggestions of mirroring UK government tactics of lowering council tax, stressing that such measures would not meaningfully impact Wales' economy given the region's lower average tax bills.\n\nDespite facing criticism from rivals, primarily Plaid Cymru, for an allegedly lackluster response to economic challenges, Finance Minister Hutt stands by the decision, asserting that the package builds on existing efforts to enhance economic vitality and public services.

While the UK has not been fined, it will be responsible for covering legal costs related to the case, which highlighted various breaches concerning wastewater management in England and Gibraltar. The challenges stem from the outdated Victorian sewers in the UK, which were originally designed to handle both sewage and rainwater. The increasing urban development and more frequent storms due to climate change have strained the system over time. Welsh Water has over 3,000 special overflow pipes that act as relief valves during heavy rainfall, but the discharge goes directly into rivers and the sea, impacting the environment.

Designated as a scheduled monument by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport on advice from Historic England, the Bulford Kiwi commemorates the Kiwi soldiers' notable involvement in the Battle of Messines during June 1917 in Belgium. Similarly, a monument at Cannock Chase in Staffordshire was granted protection to mark the same battle. Following the battle, German prisoners of war constructed the Terrain Model of Messines, a detailed scale model using soil, concrete, bricks, and pebbles. Initially a popular tourist attraction, the model fell into disrepair before being rediscovered, reburied to prevent damage, and now safeguarded for preservation. Roger Bowdler of Historic England emphasized the significance of these monuments in honoring New Zealand's wartime valor and historical contributions. He highlighted the symbolization of camaraderie through the Bulford Kiwi, created by Kiwi soldiers themselves, and the strategic importance of the Messines ridge layout crafted by prisoners of war. These preserved landmarks offer insight into past events that shaped national identities and connect current generations to their historical roots. Sir Jerry Mateparae, the New Zealand High Commissioner to the UK, praised Historic England for safeguarding these sites, acknowledging the enduring bonds between New Zealand and the UK forged during World War I and maintained to this day.

But hey, there's a concern that lots of seniors could be living in poor health. The North East and North West seem to have lower life expectancies for 65-year-olds compared to other areas. It's cool that older folks in England reached their highest life expectancy levels in 2014 - with guys seeing an increase of 0.3 years at age 65, and 0.2 years at 75, 85, and 95 since 2013. For the ladies, they saw the same boosts at those same ages! This was after a dip in life expectancy in certain older age groups between 2011 and 2012. The only region where life expectancy didn't rise for both guys and gals in 2014 was the North East, where guys had a higher expectancy in 2013. Among local councils in England, most saw a rise or no change in life expectancy at 65 - but a quarter experienced a drop. Traditionally, stats used to focus on life expectancy at birth, but nowadays, since most deaths occur in people over 80, the trends in older age groups are getting more important. Prof John Newton from Public Health England thinks the report paints a positive national picture, emphasizing the need for a great quality of life in later years. You still have the chance to make a positive change in your health, even in mid-life, like quitting smoking, being active, or eating better to enjoy healthier golden years. There's a bit of mystery behind why trends differ so much in various areas. Danny Dorling from the University of Oxford stresses the urgency to figure out why the health improvements have hit a plateau in several English regions. In Scotland, life expectancy keeps rising, with 65-year-old guys looking at around 17.4 more years, and gals about 19.7 more years.

Frank McAveety, the council leader, emphasized that while the increase would bring in over \u00a37m, the council is staring down a hefty budget gap of \u00a367m. Only a handful of councils have declared their plans so far, with around a third hinting at a potential 3% rise. More details about Glasgow's budget proposals are on the horizon for later. McAveety is keen on the tax hike, stating that it will help bolster frontline services and safeguard the city's most vulnerable residents. Approximately a quarter of households will not see an increase in their bills, sparing them from the sting of budget cuts. In Glasgow, the average Band D bill stands at \u00a31,213, surpassing the national average of \u00a31,149. Other bands will also feel the pinch, especially those in higher categories like E, F, G, and H. These changes will take effect shortly before the council elections in May. Concerns are mounting over the choices councils in western Scotland are making, particularly as the SNP sets its sights on chipping away at Labour's council stronghold. Labour councillors find themselves in a tight spot, torn between squeezing more from taxpayers to soften cuts or risking backlash for failing to leverage available resources for relief. While South Lanarkshire plans to keep bills steady this year, West Dunbartonshire Council looks poised for an increase. The remaining Labour councils have yet to reveal their intentions. The Scottish government is assuring more funding for local services across Scotland in the upcoming financial year, with additional resources from council tax adjustments and allocations for headteachers to enhance educational outcomes. Expect a final decision on Glasgow's council tax in February.", "Sustainable Shetland, a group that objects to the development, has declared its intention to pursue a judicial review of the Scottish government's decision to greenlight the project. The proposed wind farm, which would be managed by community enterprise Viking Energy, is slated to become the third largest in Scotland. In April, Energy Minister Fergus Ewing approved the plan. Opponents argue that the development is oversized and would detract from the natural landscape. On the other hand, proponents contend that it would generate revenue for the islands, create employment opportunities, and aid in meeting renewable energy objectives. The 370MW wind farm aims to supply electricity to over 175,000 households, despite Shetland's small population of around 22,000. It is projected that the wind farm could contribute approximately \u00a330 million in annual income to the local community.", "In a recent twist of events, Mr Besigye emerged as the leading challenger to President Yoweri Museveni in Uganda's recent general election, a contest which ultimately saw Mr Museveni secure a resounding victory. Despite the official outcome being upheld by Uganda's highest court, Mr Besigye stands firm in claiming victory. His legal representative, Erias Lukwago, revealed that Mr Besigye has been charged with treason after being arrested in downtown Kampala and subsequently transported to Moroto, where he remains in custody. This comes in the wake of a string of detentions targeting the opposition leader during the heated election season. Meanwhile, Mr Museveni has now been sworn in for his fifth consecutive term amidst accusations of election irregularities and voter intimidation by foreign observers. In a bold rebuttal to claims of vote rigging, Mr Museveni accused Mr Besigye of instigating violence, dismissing criticisms of the electoral process as unfounded. A pivotal figure in the fight against militant groups in the region, Mr Museveni's three-decade rule has been applauded for bringing stability to Uganda, though detractors argue it has veered towards authoritarianism.

Despite providing information to the investigation, Mr Platini maintains he acted only as a witness. Both men deny any wrongdoing. Mr Platini remains resolute in his decision to pursue the Fifa presidency once Mr Blatter steps down. While Mr Platini denies facing criminal proceedings, the Swiss attorney general disputes this claim, stating that Mr Platini was investigated as both a witness and an accused person. The attorney general expresses readiness to search the Uefa headquarters as part of the probe. The focus of the allegations is a payment made to Mr Platini in 2011 for work completed nearly a decade earlier, amidst questions about its timing. Although initially told that Fifa faced financial constraints, records reveal a significant revenue surplus during the time of Mr Platini's work. Both Fifa and its officials have come under scrutiny this year, following corruption investigations by the US and Swiss authorities.

But the one-table setup of this event is truly special, and I am eagerly anticipating playing in the arena tomorrow [Thursday]. I am full of excitement.\" \n\nHiggins dominated all three sessions against Wilson, world number 16, and he believes his performance has improved significantly throughout the tournament. While identifying Mark Selby as the title favorite and Barry Hawkins as his pre-competition pick, Higgins expressed his own mental readiness for the semi-final. \"The nerves are mounting, but I feel more at ease this time around,\" he shared. \"I am unsure if that is due to my decent form. Success in this tournament requires strong frames and breaks, as seen in my matches against Mark Allen and Kyren. Winning demands sessions of dominance, and I believe my game is capable of that. But of course, other players may hold similar views. Some sessions during this event have been exceptional for me. For example, in the final of the Champions, I faced [Ronnie] O'Sullivan and couldn't have played any better. You just hope to replicate that in important matches.\" \n\nRegarding his potential semi-final opponent Stephen Maguire, Higgins expressed a desire to ensure a Scottish presence in the final. \"Everyone makes their own decisions, and as Scots, we might enjoy a drink or two, which is fine,\" Higgins commented. \"Life is too short. Stephen is a talented player, and I wish him the best. If he were to defeat me, I would genuinely root for him to secure his first world title.

The girls journeyed to Liverpool Street station on the morning of 2 January, where they rendezvoused with Mr. Richard in a nearby cafe. The girls allegedly claimed they were 16 and 17, concealing their true ages.\n\nThe situation took a dramatic turn when the older girl's mother discovered an unexpected PayPal deposit in her bank account, prompting her to involve the authorities.

Uber confirmed that the board unanimously agreed to adopt all the recommendations, but the details will only be disclosed on Tuesday. Mr. Holder was tasked with conducting the review in February following allegations of sexual harassment by former Uber engineer Susan Fowler. The Financial Times indicated that both Uber and Mr. Michael have not disclosed whether his departure was a resignation or a firing. Analyst James Cakmak from Monness Crespi Hardt stated that Mr. Michael's exit serves as a scapegoat for Uber, potentially safeguarding Mr. Kalanick. If Kalanick were to leave, returning might prove challenging, as mentioned by Mr. Cakmak to Bloomberg. The possibility of Kalanick taking a leave of absence or adjusting his role was discussed during a seven-hour board meeting in Los Angeles on Sunday. Kalanick has been on bereavement leave since his mother's passing in a boating accident. An Uber source noted that Holder's recommendations include implementing greater oversight in spending, human resources, and other areas where executives, led by Kalanick, have had a significant level of autonomy despite Uber's size of more than 12,000 employees.

Coming from Atletico's academy, Borja expressed some frustration about not getting more opportunities with the first team despite his success on loan at Eibar, where he scored 18 goals last season in La Liga. Choosing Swansea was an easy decision for Borja due to the club's strong interest and belief in his abilities. While he has yet to receive a senior call-up for Spain like Llorente, Borja aims to follow the footsteps of former Swansea striker Michu, who earned a national team cap after a prolific season with the Swans. He hopes to score goals, contribute to Swansea's success, and ultimately catch the eye of the national team selectors.", "A 45-year-old man was arrested on Bury Old Road in Greater Manchester during the Rosh Hashanah celebration of the Orthodox Jewish community.

He emphasized that their aim is to safeguard the foundations of democracy rather than being perceived as sore losers. Their candidate was narrowly defeated by the former Green Party leader by around 31,000 votes. The challenge has been officially filed with the constitutional court by Christian Neuwirth, a spokesperson for Austria's constitutional court. The court now has a period of four weeks to respond, potentially revealing its findings just two days before the scheduled swearing-in of the poll winner, Alexander Van der Bellen. This situation begs the question: Is Europe undergoing a shift towards the far right? The surge of nationalism in Europe is a point of concern, country by country. In addition, there are worries about whether populism poses a threat to Europe's economies. Despite being a largely ceremonial role, winning the presidency could have propelled the Freedom Party towards success in the upcoming parliamentary elections in 2018. Analysts suggest that this legal challenge risks reigniting the divisions that emerged during the election, exposing deep-seated differences in Europe regarding how to address issues such as the migrant crisis, the economy, and the balance between national interests and those of the EU. Although initial results had put the Freedom Party's Norbert Hofer slightly ahead, Mr Van der Bellen was eventually declared the election winner with 50.3% of the vote compared to Mr Hofer's 49.7%. Nonetheless, the Freedom Party has alleged numerous irregularities, with Mr Strache submitting a 150-page document to the constitutional court outlining concerns about the illegal handling of postal ballots in a significant number of district election offices. Reports suggest that over 570,000 ballots may have been impacted by this. Furthermore, the party claims to have evidence that individuals under the age of 16 and foreigners were allowed to cast votes. Mr Strache expressed deep concern about the extent of these irregularities, stating that he felt compelled to challenge the result. If the evidence is accepted by the constitutional court, various outcomes are possible, including a partial recount or a fresh vote in affected regions. Ultimately, the court will have to assess whether any laws were violated and whether these breaches could have influenced the election outcome.", "The compelling report recommends a necessary separation of roles, highlighting the uniqueness of the current dual position held by the head of the legal system and the president of the States.

The official explained over the phone that the Americans had been detained by Houthi security forces under suspicion of spying. Last month, the US state department announced the death of an American contractor working for the United Nations who had been detained at Sanaa's airport. The contractor, John Hamen, and a colleague, both believed to be American, were held upon their arrival on a UN aircraft from Djibouti. In a separate incident, two Americans who had been held captive by the Houthis for months were released and safely transported to Oman. Additionally, a British citizen and three Saudis were also freed in the same operation. The Houthis, who seized control of Yemen's government in Sanaa this year, are currently facing military actions from a coalition led by Saudi Arabia and supported by the US.

This initiative is part of a series of renewable energy projects planned for the area, which is under the ownership of Buccleuch Estates. The aim is to transform the former opencast mine into Glenmuckloch Energy Park. Detailed plans were unveiled in a scoping report for the pumped storage hydro scheme, which was submitted to Dumfries and Galloway Council. Buccleuch Estates has partnered with mining company Hargreaves and 2020 Renewables to develop these proposals. The project entails the construction of two reservoirs, one situated at a higher elevation than the other, connected by a tunnel housing a pump-turbine system. The report explains that during periods of surplus electricity in the grid, the pump-turbines will pump water to the upper reservoir, and when demand surpasses supply, the pump-turbines will enter generating mode, releasing water from the upper reservoir. Should the project progress, the lower reservoir will be formed within the existing opencast void, while the upper reservoir will be excavated at the top of Halfmerk Hill. The higher reservoir is anticipated to have a water depth of 22m (72 feet), providing storage for 3.3 million cubic meters of water. The redevelopment of Glenmuckloch comes after the collapse of surface mining company Aardvark TMC in 2013, resulting in a funding shortfall for the restoration of the site. Subsequently, Buccleuch Estates and Hargreaves have collaborated on a comprehensive restoration program alongside coal operations. Additionally, two community wind turbines are scheduled to be constructed to the west of the hydro site later this summer. Earlier this year, plans for an eight-turbine wind farm adjacent to the mine were also submitted to Dumfries and Galloway Council.", "The East Sussex Healthcare Trust, responsible for managing the Conquest Hospital in Hastings and the Eastbourne District General Hospital, is currently assessed as \"inadequate.\" Despite efforts to improve, BBC South East Today has obtained information suggesting that the trust has not demonstrated significant progress, prompting discussions that may lead to its placement under special measures at an upcoming meeting. The trust has indicated its anticipation of an upcoming report and therefore refrained from providing a response. Notably, other trusts, such as the East Kent Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and the Medway NHS Foundation Trust, are already subject to special measures. Recent incidents, including the temporary diversion of ambulances from Medway's Maritime Hospital and concerns raised by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) due to failure in meeting government standards, have highlighted ongoing issues within the trust's management. Criticisms from various stakeholders, including the Eastbourne Borough Council and the resignation of the chief executive, further underscore the challenges faced by the trust. The CQC's observations in March suggested a breakdown in communication between the trust's leadership and its staff, indicating a culture of fear among employees inhibiting their ability to provide feedback. As discussions continue, stakeholders within the healthcare community remain skeptical about the trust's progress, with expectations of potential intervention through special measures. A spokesperson for the trust declined to offer insights on the possibility of such measures, citing the pending CQC report as a necessary consideration before making further statements.", "Lisa Doughty, who has mesothelioma, attended Haggerston Girls' School in Hackney, London during the 1980s.

Hackney Council has not received a formal claim and is currently unable to investigate. Ms. Doughty spent significant time in the music room each week rehearsing plays and noticed white dust on the desks, possibly coming from the crumbling ceiling when heavy doors in the room slammed shut. She believes that if her cancer was caused by exposure in the music room, others may also be affected and is urging them to come forward. Ms. Doughty's lawyers have found asbestos ceiling tiles in the school during her time there and are considering legal action.

Following successful trials in the Netherlands, it is evident that drones have become a tool for criminals to breach security and engage in illicit activities. Recent incidents, such as the attempted smuggling of contraband into prisons and the near misses at airports, underscore the urgent need for effective countermeasures.\n\nEagles, as skilled predators, offer a unique solution to the drone problem. Their abilities to track, intercept, and neutralize drones make them invaluable assets in safeguarding public safety. While some skepticism has been raised about the feasibility of this approach, the expertise of organizations such as the International Centre of Birds of Prey should inform and guide these initiatives. By leveraging the innate instincts and capabilities of these majestic birds, law enforcement agencies can enhance their response capabilities and stay ahead of tech-savvy criminals.\n\nGiven the potential ethical concerns regarding the welfare of the birds, collaboration with animal welfare organizations such as the RSPCA is crucial to ensure that the training and utilization of eagles are carried out responsibly.

In response, governmental authorities have intensified their efforts to counteract the dissemination of misinformation that has contributed to the migration trend towards Canada. Notably, following the 2010 tragic earthquake in Haiti, approximately 60,000 Haitians were granted temporary protection by the United States, a status extended by the Trump administration until January 2018. Contrary to the U.S., Canada terminated its designated protected status for Haitians a year prior. \n\nIn 2016, nearly half of the asylum claims submitted by Haitian nationals were declined. As emphasized by Federal Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale on Monday, the act of crossing the border irregularly should not be perceived as an advantageous or fruitful practice. Concurrently, Canadian diplomatic representatives in the U.S. have been diligently dispelling misconceptions regarding immigration to Canada, particularly those guaranteeing residency. Minister of Immigration Ahmed Hussen reported that Federal Liberal MP Emmanuel Dubourg, fluent in Creole and of Haitian descent, has been actively engaging with Haitian media outlets in American urban centers such as Miami and New York to address this matter.\n\nOver the preceding weekend, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau underscored the nation's stance on immigration during a press briefing in Montreal, reaffirming that, while Canada is inclusive and hospitable, adherence to stringent immigration and customs regulations is non-negotiable. The opposition has criticized Prime Minister Trudeau for purportedly promoting \"refugee-friendly\" policies through what they deem as 'irresponsible' communication strategies, which have allegedly contributed to the influx of migrants. Consequently, Canadian authorities are intensifying efforts to combat the proliferation of inaccurate information online regarding the ease of accessing Canada's asylum system.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, 7,500 migrants have crossed into Canada through illicit means, with a significant portion choosing Quebec as their entry point. Notably, the influx of migrants in the region surged over threefold, from 781 to 2,996, from June to July. The government has promptly responded by augmenting the presence of personnel in the area to expedite the processing of asylum claims, which currently entails a waiting period of five months.", "A University College London team engaged with paediatricians at 177 hospitals in England and Wales, revealing inadequate awareness regarding underweight children and severe complications. Despite encountering children with eating disorders, most respondents demonstrated limited knowledge in this area. The Royal College of Paediatrics acknowledged the need for improved training, with Study leader Dr. Lee Hudson highlighting a concerning trend where more under-13s now seek treatment for eating disorders compared to meningitis, due to vaccination successes. Dr. Hudson's research emphasized the lack of expertise in identifying underweight children and associated medical issues, attributing this gap to the evolving landscape of childhood illnesses. A survey of on-call paediatricians disclosed deficiencies in using Body Mass Index and recognizing signs of critical complications. The researchers expressed particular alarm that only a small percentage were familiar with key danger signals related to cardiac function. The study also underscored inadequate knowledge of potentially dangerous complications stemming from malnutrition. Dr. Hudson underscored the challenge of diagnosing eating disorders amid ambiguous symptoms, calling for enhanced training and more consistent services for affected children. Prof. Russell Viner, also from the Royal College of Paediatrics, affirmed ongoing efforts to address the training gap on issues surrounding adolescent health, mental health, and malnutrition.", "China allowed couples to have two children to address an aging population and improve population balance. The one-child policy, implemented in 1979, aimed to slow population growth and resulted in punishments for violators. While the policy has been relaxed in some provinces, critics argue that even a two-child policy may not increase birth rates significantly. The recent change is seen as a pragmatic response to an unpopular policy, according to experts.

British Gas's change starts on 16 March, while EDF's starts eight days later. These cuts help customers on a regular gas tariff. The big six UK energy suppliers are pressured to pass on savings to customers after a 57% drop in gas prices. E.On was the first to cut prices by 5.1%, followed by SSE, Scottish Power, and Npower. Richard Lloyd of consumer group Which? said the small cuts by all big suppliers are questionable if competition is effective. British Gas estimates an average saving of \u00a331 for 6.8 million customers due to the 5.1% cut. EDF said about 900,000 customers would save \u00a331 annually with no exit fees on fixed deals. EDF stated the price reduction reflects lower wholesale gas costs. Mark Hodges of Centrica mentioned competitive pricing is vital to retain and attract customers in this competitive market. Experts suggest that standard tariffs are costly, so it's beneficial to explore other options to save more money. Ofgem advises switching to fixed deals for significant savings. The industry faces criticism for not reducing electricity tariffs despite falling costs. British Gas cited rising delivery and environmental costs for the inability to lower electricity prices. The competition watchdog investigation concluding in June aims to assess if consumers are getting fair deals.

Yardy then stepped in with a solid 70 at Lord's, helping the visitors reach a total of 300 all out - giving them a first innings lead of 66. By the end of the day's play, Middlesex were at 47-0 with Sam Robson smashing 41 not out, just trailing by 19 runs. The pitch looked tired, but Machan's amazing performance stood out, while Yardy and Wells took a more methodical approach. Patel didn't make an impact in the Middlesex bowling attack until they had scored 150 runs. However, in just his second over, he managed to dismiss Machan, followed by Wells, Chris Nash, and Ben Brown. Just when the home side seemed to be taking charge at 216-6, Sussex fought back. Zaidi and Yardy added 38 runs, and then Yardy and Ollie Robinson contributed with a useful 40. James Harris then wrapped up the Sussex innings by removing Yardy and Chris Liddle in quick succession, leaving the match finely balanced.

However, the ruling recognized that oversight measures were established last year. Described as a \"highly significant judgement\" by Privacy International, the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPT) evaluated the spy agencies' practices, particularly their collection of communication data and personal information without scrutinizing the contents. GCHQ stressed the importance of such data in intelligence operations.\n\nWhile the Telecommunications Act 1984 was cited for much of the data collection, it was noted that it did not clearly outline its potential use. According to Graham Smith of London law firm Bird & Bird, laws governing agency activities should not be shrouded in secrecy despite the operational need for confidentiality.

Human rights organizations have raised objections to the proposed punishments, stating that combating violence with violence is not the solution. The Indonesian Doctors Association raised ethical concerns, asserting that administering chemical castration would go against their professional principles and advising their members not to partake in it. The procedure involves injecting convicts with female hormones and is already employed for sex offenders in countries like Poland, South Korea, Russia, and select states in the US, while prisoners in UK correctional facilities have the option to undergo this treatment willingly. The new laws also give judges the authority to hand down death sentences or to electronically monitor pedophiles, in addition to mandating a minimum 10-year imprisonment for crimes against children. Various human rights bodies, including the National Commission for Women (NCW), have criticized these laws, calling for annual reassessments to determine their effectiveness as a deterrent. Azriana, the NCW's leader, emphasized that countries implementing chemical castration have not witnessed a decline in sexual crimes against children, labeling the procedure as costly and advocating for more investment in victim support services. Dr. Yohana Susana Yembise, the Minister for Women Empowerment and Child Protection in Indonesia, expressed hope that the new punitive measures would yield the anticipated results, stressing that despite potential reservations, everyone must rally behind these laws which include severe penalties such as the death penalty, life imprisonment, chemical castration, public exposure of offenders, and electronic monitoring. These steps were taken in response to a series of highly publicized cases of child sexual abuse in the nation, including the imprisonment of a British-Canadian educator and an Indonesian individual for 10 years for sexually exploiting three children at a Jakarta school last year, as well as the tragic discovery earlier this year of a nine-year-old girl's body in Jakarta, having been subjected to repeated sexual assaults before being killed and concealed in a cardboard box.", "Makeover: A 17-year-old teenager fell around 40m (130ft) into a dry riverbed below while participating in a bungee jumping known as \"puenting.\" The incident happened at a bridge located over the A8 road at Cabezon de la Sal in Cantabria, Spain. The teenager was part of a group from the Netherlands and Belgium who were staying at a nearby surf camp. This unfortunate event, deemed a \"ghastly accident,\" resulted in severe injuries to the teenager. There might have been a lapse in caution that led to the accident, although the exact cause remains uncertain. It is essential to ensure the safety of the bungee jumping activity before taking the plunge. Bungee jumping has gained popularity in Spain among both locals and visitors, with picturesque locations in Andalusia, Cantabria, and the Pyrenees attracting enthusiasts and beginners alike. Companies offer various bungee jumping experiences, including bridge swinging, called \"puenting.\" Notably, there have been about 10 fatalities related to bungee jumping since its emergence in the 1980s, with the most recent incidents occurring this summer..Local authorities expressed concern over the extreme risk associated with puenting on the bridge where the accident happened. The tragic loss of a young life was deeply felt by the community, with the mayor expressing readiness to support the teenager's family through this difficult time.", "Archaeologists from the National Trust for Scotland uncovered a hidden walled enclosure beneath the lawn in the Fountain Court of a South Ayrshire castle. Dating back to the period between 1733 and 1782, it likely served as a kitchen garden during that time. The construction of a new walled garden away from the house in the late 18th Century was in line with the fashion of the era, allowing the former site to be landscaped for enhanced castle views. Derek Alexander, the head of archaeological services at NTS, expressed surprise at the discovery, previously unknown beneath the pristine turf of Fountain Court. The finding has provided valuable insight into Culzean's history, revealing a side that remained hidden until now. The abandoned garden is believed to have been established by Sir John Kennedy of Culzean in 1733, as evidenced in an estate map drawn by John Foulis in 1755. Subsequently, in 1782, the walls were dismantled by Robert Adam's workers as part of extensive renovations at the castle. Presently, drainage improvements taking place at Fountain Court aim to enhance the space for hosting large public gatherings.", "The significant milestone was achieved in March, which was ahead of schedule by nine months. This achievement comes after years of worldwide efforts and financial investments to provide antiretroviral drugs to those in need, particularly individuals in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2000, when the UN initially established objectives to combat HIV, less than 700,000 individuals were receiving these crucial medications. The latest report by UNAIDS states that the global response to HIV has prevented 30 million new HIV infections and almost eight million AIDS-related deaths since the turn of the century. During the same period, new HIV infections have decreased from 2.6 million to 1.8 million annually, and AIDS-related deaths have dropped from 1.6 million to 1.2 million. Global funding for HIV has surged from \u00a33.1 billion in 2000 to over \u00a313 billion in 2014. UNAIDS suggests that with concerted efforts in the next five years, the AIDS epidemic could come to an end by 2030. However, progress has been slower in some areas. A significant challenge lies in the lack of awareness of HIV status, which is the primary obstacle to accessing treatment, as per the report. Treatment access for children has also been slower compared to adults, although this situation is gradually improving. The percentage of children with HIV receiving antiretroviral therapy almost doubled between 2010 and 2014, reaching 32% from 14%. Nonetheless, the coverage for children still lags behind that of adults. Despite the decline in new HIV infections, the number of new cases remains unacceptably high, contributing to the burden of the epidemic. Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 66% of all new HIV infections in 2014, with approximately 25.8 million people in this region living with HIV. On a global scale, an estimated 36.9 million people were living with HIV. This year transitions from the Millennium Development Goals to the broader Sustainable Development Goals. Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary General of the United Nations, stated, \"The world has made progress in halting and reversing the AIDS epidemic. Now, we must commit to ending the AIDS epidemic as part of the Sustainable Development Goals.\" The report emphasizes that the next five years will be crucial and recommends increasing investment to swiftly work towards the goal of ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030.", "James, a 23-year-old man from Colwyn Bay who stands at 3 feet 7 inches tall due to dwarfism, has faced challenges with his health since a young age. He underwent a significant neck operation at the age of three, followed by another operation at seven to help straighten his legs using lizeroth frames.

Though sales volumes rose by 0.7%, slightly lower than the UK's 0.8%, the Scottish Retail Sales Index indicated a more significant year-over-year growth of 2.7% in sales volume and a 0.1% increase in value. Despite this positive trend, Director of the Scottish Retail Consortium, David Lonsdale, highlighted the persisting fragility in consumer confidence affecting retailers. Urging the next Scottish government to prioritize policies fostering investment and sectoral expansion, Lonsdale emphasized the importance of adapting to economic conditions and capitalizing on emerging opportunities. Euan Murray of Barclays Corporate Banking noted that the sales boost in the first quarter was largely food-driven and saw increased online activity among value-conscious consumers. As Scotland's retailers navigated a mixed month in March, experiencing a decline in total sales but with strong performance in household goods, the report underlined the growing significance of online retail.", "His younger brother Ogbonna informed BBC Sport that the former Arsenal forward is recovering well after undergoing the operation. The decision to proceed with the surgery was made during his routine annual medical examination. The family expresses gratitude that the procedure was successful and he is now in excellent health. They extend a heartfelt 'thank you' to Nigerians and Nwankwo Kanu's supporters worldwide for their prayers and well wishes. Nwankwo Kanu, a former captain of Nigeria, had initially undergone heart surgery in November 1996 to correct a faulty aortic valve. Following a brief absence, he resumed playing for Inter Milan and later joined Arsenal in February 1999. This experience inspired him to establish a foundation aimed at constructing five hospitals in Africa for the treatment of undiagnosed heart conditions and surgeries. Over the weekend, the Nigerian government recognized Kanu as one of the 100 most distinguished Nigerians during an event commemorating the centenary of the unification of northern and southern Nigeria. Kanu announced his retirement from international football during the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.

The council expressed its aim to enhance the schools' efficiency by allowing them to operate within their building capacities more effectively. In the past 20 years, there has been a significant decrease in secondary pupil numbers, while primary schools have the capacity to accommodate another 1,400 children. All four secondary schools in Dumfries are either undergoing rebuilding or refurbishment as part of the Learning Town scheme.
