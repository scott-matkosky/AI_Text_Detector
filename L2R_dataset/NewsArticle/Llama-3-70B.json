Upon assembling outside, they witnessed two buses, parked in close proximity in the car park, fully engulfed in flames. The buses were transporting tourists from Germany and China/Taiwan, respectively, who were commencing their first night in Northern Ireland. According to one of the bus drivers, numerous passengers had left personal belongings on board, which were subsequently destroyed in the blaze. Both tour groups have arranged for replacement coaches and will proceed with their scheduled tour of the north coast, albeit with a delayed start. The authorities have issued an appeal for information regarding the incident. Inspector David Gibson stated, \"Preliminary indications suggest that the fire originated beneath one of the buses before spreading to the second. Although the exact cause remains under investigation, it is believed that the fire was intentionally set.\"", "A 67-year-old former scout leader from Lincolnshire, now living in London, stands accused of committing heinous crimes against four young boys. John Edward Bates faces a staggering 22 charges, including two counts of indecency with a child, allegedly committed between 1972 and 1989. Despite the damning allegations, Bates vehemently denies any wrongdoing, claiming the victims are fabricating their accounts and lying.\n\nProsecutor Grace Hale painted a disturbing picture of Bates' alleged actions, revealing that he exploited his position of trust to prey on vulnerable boys. In one shocking incident, Bates allegedly lured a 15-year-old to his home under the guise of showing him scout camp cine films, only to subject him to pornographic content and then sexually abuse him, leaving the boy confused and terrified.\n\nHale told the jury that another boy, just 13 or 14 years old, was taken on a weekend trip to London, where Bates plied him with drinks in pubs before sexually abusing him. Two more boys from the Spalding group have also come forward with harrowing accounts of sexual abuse at the hands of Bates.\n\nThe jury learned that Bates had a seemingly respectable background, having served in the RAF and later as a Lincolnshire Police officer between 1976 and 1983. However, the trial, expected to last two weeks, will delve deeper into the dark secrets of Bates' past and determine whether he is guilty of the heinous crimes he is accused of.", "A hospital in Istanbul, Cerahpasa, was evacuated on Wednesday after a young police officer, who was receiving psychiatric treatment, threatened to harm himself and others. Authorities were called to the scene to negotiate with the officer, but initial reports of him taking hostages were false. According to the hospital's chief consultant, Dr. Zekayi Kutlubay, the officer was alone in his room and had been undergoing treatment for two years. The hospital had previously warned that the officer should not be allowed to carry a gun, and his issued firearm had been taken away. However, he somehow obtained another gun, which he had with him during the incident. This event has added to the existing tension in Istanbul, which has seen several attacks in crowded areas, including a deadly nightclub shooting on New Year's Eve that killed 39 people.", "A tragic incident occurred on Saturday at 05:30 GMT on Streatham High Road, resulting in the fatal injury of Veronica Vanessa Chango-Alverez, 31, and the injury of another male pedestrian. The collision involved an Audi A3, which had been involved in a prior incident in London Road, Croydon, just 10 minutes earlier, where it collided with a Volkswagen Passat that struck a tree. The Audi was abandoned at the scene of the subsequent crash.\n\nPreliminary investigations indicate that Ms. Chango-Alverez succumbed to multiple injuries sustained in the collision, as confirmed by a post-mortem examination. The authorities are currently seeking to locate Nathan Davis, 27, who is believed to have ties to the Audi.\n\nMs. Chango-Alverez, a 13-year resident of London, originally from Ecuador, was residing at her mother's home in Streatham High Road at the time of the incident. She was en route to her workplace at a local hotel when the tragedy occurred.\n\nThe bus stop, which was severely damaged in the crash, has been removed, and a makeshift memorial has been established at the site, with flowers and tributes left in memory of the victim.\n\nIn a statement, Ms. Chango-Alverez's brother, Kevin Raul Chango-Alverez, expressed the family's devastation, saying, \"Our family's heart has been torn apart, and we will never be the same again. We were together as a family just the night before, celebrating the arrival of my newborn nephew and preparing for Christmas. I last saw Veronica alive as she left for work on Saturday morning, only to hold her hand as she passed away in the street moments later.\"\n\nDetective Inspector Gordon Wallace described the incident as \"horrific\" and emphasized the devastating impact on the family, stating, \"The memory of this senseless death will haunt them every time they leave their home. The driver fled the scene, abandoning the extensively damaged grey Audi. We are seeking to speak with Mr. Nathan Davis in connection with this collision.\"\n\nThe 51-year-old man injured at the bus stop remains in critical condition in hospital, while the 29-year-old driver of the Volkswagen is now reported to be in stable condition.", "Tragedy struck the Gent-Wevelgem race in Belgium when 25-year-old cyclist Antoine Demoitie was fatally hit by a motorbike after a crash involving multiple riders in northern France. Team Sky's Luke Rowe attributed the incident to the fundamental issue of motorbikes and cars passing the peloton, citing the presence of around 50 motorbikes in each race, including those used for TV cameras, photography, and police escort. Rowe suggested implementing a speed limit for motorbikes overtaking cyclists, such as a 10kph limit, to improve safety. Demoitie, who rode for Wanty-Gobert, was taken to a hospital in Lille but sadly passed away. The UCI and CPA have pledged to investigate the incident and improve safety measures. Despite this tragedy, Rowe believes that cyclists must not let fear of crashes affect their performance, as it would hinder their ability to compete at the top level. In a separate incident, 22-year-old Belgian cyclist Daan Myngheer died in hospital after suffering a heart attack during the Criterium International in Corsica.", "As Ilkay Gundogan, 26, embarks on the final stretch of his rehabilitation, he's adamant he won't rush back onto the pitch. The German midfielder has been down this road before, having missed the 2014 World Cup due to back surgery and Euro 2016 with a dislocated kneecap. The mental toll of those setbacks still lingers, but Gundogan is determined to return stronger than ever.\n\n\"I can see the finishing line,\" he told BBC Sport, his voice laced with determination. \"It's been a long and arduous journey, but I'm not going to risk my health by rushing back. I want to feel ready, safe, and confident when I make my comeback.\"\n\nGundogan's recovery is now measured in weeks, not months, and he's eager to rejoin his Manchester City teammates. He's been impressed by their 4-1 thrashing of Real Madrid in a pre-season friendly and is optimistic about the upcoming season.\n\n\"The worst part is behind me now,\" he said, reflecting on his injury woes. \"I've fallen and fought my way back before, and I'm ready to do it again. I don't mind if it takes two weeks or six \u2013 I just want to be fully fit and ready to contribute to the team.\"\n\nGundogan's debut season with City was cut short by injury, but he still managed 15 appearances and five goals. He's itching to get back on the pitch and make a meaningful impact. With Pep Guardiola's new signings and continued interest in top talent like Alexis Sanchez and Kylian Mbappe, Gundogan believes City are poised for a title push.\n\n\"Optimism for the season is huge,\" he said, his enthusiasm palpable. \"We know the Premier League better now, and we can't wait to get started.\"\n\nCity's next test comes against Tottenham in Nashville on Saturday, a team Gundogan rates highly. \"Tottenham are a great team with a fantastic style of football,\" he said. \"They have talented young English players, and our experience last season shows just how tough they are to beat.

A young man, barely out of his teenage years, suffered a severe head injury and multiple fractures, according to the ambulance service. Emergency responders rushed to his aid, providing critical care at the scene before airlifting him to the Royal London Hospital for further treatment. The usually bustling Southend-bound carriageway of the A127 was closed for a staggering six hours as police meticulously gathered evidence and pieced together the events surrounding the crash.

Newsround reporter Jenny Lawrence breaks it down.", "**Shocking Discovery: Wireless Mice Leave Computers Wide Open to Hackers**\n\nA startling vulnerability has been uncovered in the way wireless mice communicate with computers, leaving them exposed to sneaky attacks. According to security experts at Bastille Networks, hackers can easily impersonate the signals sent by these mice, effectively taking control of a PC as if they were sitting right in front of it.\n\nThe problem lies in the unencrypted radio signals transmitted by many wireless mice to a small device called a \"dongle\" plugged into a computer. This lack of security allows attackers to send fake signals, tricking the computer into thinking they're coming from a keyboard, and enabling them to execute commands and take over the machine.\n\nIn a surprising twist, wireless keyboards were found to be much more secure, with their signals scrambled to prevent eavesdropping and spoofing. The researchers at Bastille were able to exploit the weakness in wireless mice using just a few lines of code and a $20 antenna and dongle, with the attack working from distances of up to 590 feet.\n\nThe implications are alarming, as hackers could use this technique to gain control of computers and wreak havoc. The researchers found that wireless mice from major brands like HP, Lenovo, Amazon, and Dell were all vulnerable to this attack.\n\nBastille has alerted the affected manufacturers and the company behind the vulnerable chipset, and some are now releasing updates to fix the issue. However, many of the insecure mice cannot be updated, leaving them open to exploitation.\n\nThis discovery serves as a wake-up call to companies to pay closer attention to the security of their wireless devices and the data they transmit. As the researchers pointed out, many organizations focus on securing their physical devices but neglect the radio signals that connect them.", "Murray and Burrell, a Galashiels-based business established in 1928, has gone into administration due to \"adverse trading conditions\", resulting in 38 redundancies.

Amazon denies receiving special treatment, claiming it follows the same tax laws as other companies in Luxembourg. The Luxembourg finance ministry is confident that the allegations are unfounded and will be able to prove the legitimacy of the arrangement.\n\nThe EC launched an investigation into the deal last year, suspecting it broke EU rules. The investigation found that Luxembourg may not have properly examined Amazon's transfer pricing proposals or ensured the tax regime was in line with market conditions. The EC also questions how royalty payments between Amazon companies were calculated and whether Amazon has a financial incentive to exaggerate these payments to reduce its tax liability.\n\nLuxembourg claims to have cooperated fully with the investigation and provided all required information. The EC is also investigating similar tax deals between Luxembourg and Fiat, as well as arrangements between Ireland and Apple, and the Netherlands and Starbucks, as part of a broader crackdown on tax avoidance schemes.", "Get ready for a fun-filled three-day celebration of farming, food, and family entertainment!

After outgrowing its original location in south Belfast, the show moved to the larger Balmoral Park venue in 2013, formerly the site of the Maze prison. This year's event coincides with Northern Ireland's Year of Food and Drink, putting local produce front and center. One of the main attractions is an \"edible garden,\" where visitors can see their food grow before it reaches their plates, encouraging them to grow their own at home. The show will also feature the best of local livestock, including prized pigs, cattle, poultry, and ponies, as well as their talented owners showcasing their horse riding, show jumping, and sheep shearing skills.

Despite this, Daniel Ortega won a landslide victory with 72.5% of the vote, with his closest rival, Maximino Rodriguez, receiving only 14.2%. The State Department's Mark Toner criticized the government for not inviting international election observers, further undermining the election's legitimacy. The US continues to urge Nicaragua to uphold democratic practices, including press freedom and human rights.\n\nOrtega's victory was widely expected due to his popular social programs and lack of strong political opposition. As a former left-wing rebel, he has led Nicaragua to economic stability, earning him support from the business sector and foreign investors. His supporters celebrated his win, but the opposition coalition, Broad Front for Democracy, called the election a \"farce\" and alleged a 70% abstention rate, which was disputed by electoral authorities.\n\nOrtega's running mate, his wife Rosario Murillo, is set to become vice-president and may eventually assume the presidency if her 70-year-old husband steps down. Nicaragua's economy has grown rapidly, but it still needs to attract more foreign investment.

The authorities have been accused of not doing enough following the recent slaying and assault of lesbian advocate Noxolo Nogwaza. Law enforcement say they do not consider sexual preference when investigating homicide. \"To us, homicide is homicide, whether somebody is Zulu, English, male or female - we don't see ethnicity, we don't see gender,\" law enforcement ministry spokesman Zweli Mnisi told the BBC on Tuesday, after rights groups urged the police to do more to find those responsible for Ms Nogwaza's demise. She was stoned, stabbed, and gang-assaulted in the KwaThema township east of Johannesburg over the Easter weekend. Unlike in many African countries, same-sex acts are legal in South Africa and discrimination based on sexual preference is banned, but advocates say gay and lesbian individuals are often attacked in townships. They say \"reparative rape\" - when a lesbian is assaulted to either punish her, or \"correct\" her behavior - is becoming increasingly prevalent. Ndumie Funda, founder of the gay rights organization Luleki Sizwe which works in 10 black townships and rural areas near Cape Town, welcomed the government's announcement. She said it was important to get \"reparative rape\" classified as a bias crime. \"The South African constitution is one of the highly respected and acknowledged constitutions and it says we are all equal; we're therefore reminding our government to say that this was being promised and we voted for you so we need protection,\" she told the BBC's Network Africa programme. Luleki Sizwe started an online petition at Change.org to get the government to take action. \"In less than six months, a tiny group of township advocates has mobilized more than 170,000 people from 163 countries and gotten the highest levels of government to address their basic demand, that the sadistic crime of 'reparative rape' be taken seriously,\" Change.org representative Benjamin Joffe-Walt is quoted by the Sapa news agency as saying. Justice ministry spokesman Tlali Tlali said the task team would begin its work in July and include six representatives from the judiciary, law enforcement, and department of social development and six representatives from the gay community. \"The team will be charged with developing a legislative intervention plan, a public awareness strategy, and LGBTI [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex]-sensitive shelters,\" he said.

Minister Edwina Hart Unveils Bold Plans to Stamp Out Fraud and Streamline the System\n\nIn a bid to restore fairness and integrity, the Transport Minister is cracking down on abuse and introducing tough new measures to prevent fraudulent claims. But it's not all smooth sailing - a major council was forced to suspend the guidelines just last year, citing concerns that genuine cases were being unfairly rejected.\n\nThe controversy began in 2013, when new guidelines were introduced to tackle abuse. However, Neath Port Talbot council, along with several other local authorities, reported a surge in rejections after being told to look beyond GP evidence. The backlash was swift, with the council suspending the guidelines in February 2015.\n\nNow, Welsh ministers are launching a consultation on their latest proposals, promising a fresh start for the transport system. Will these new measures bring much-needed change? Stay tuned to find out!", "According to recent data, individuals aged 65 can anticipate an additional 19 years of life for males and 21 years for females. However, there is growing concern that a significant proportion of elderly individuals are experiencing poor health. Furthermore, regional disparities in life expectancy are evident, with the North East and North West exhibiting lower life expectancies for 65-year-olds compared to other regions.\n\nIn 2014, life expectancy among older age groups in England reached its highest level, with male life expectancy increasing by 0.3 years at age 65 and 0.2 years at ages 75, 85, and 95 since 2013. Female life expectancy also increased by the same amounts at the same ages. This upward trend follows a decline in life expectancy among certain older age groups between 2011 and 2012.\n\nNotably, the North East was the only region where male and female life expectancy did not increase in 2014, with male life expectancy having been higher in 2013. Among local authorities in England, the majority demonstrated an increase or no change in life expectancy at age 65, while approximately one-quarter showed a decrease.\n\nHistorically, statistical analyses have focused on life expectancy at birth. However, given that the majority of deaths in England now occur among individuals over the age of 80, mortality patterns in older age groups are becoming increasingly important.\n\nProfessor John Newton, Chief Knowledge Officer at Public Health England, emphasized that the report presents a positive national picture, underscoring the importance of achieving a good quality of life in later years. He noted that individuals can still make lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking, increasing physical activity, and improving diet, to enhance their health prospects in later life.\n\nProfessor Danny Dorling, Professor of Human Geography at the University of Oxford, highlighted the urgent need to investigate the causes of stalled improvements in many parts of England in recent years. He pointed out that beneath the headline figures, there is evidence of deteriorating health among older individuals in certain regions.\n\nIn Scotland, life expectancy continues to improve, with 65-year-old men expected to live an additional 17.4 years and women an additional 19.7 years, according to the latest statistics. Nevertheless, significant regional variations persist.", "BREAKING: Operation Equinox Uncovers Shocking Abuse Claims in Nottinghamshire!\n\nA massive investigation is underway, exposing a dark history of sexual, physical, and emotional abuse that spanned decades - from the 1940s to the 1990s!

This groundbreaking operation combines the efforts of two previous inquiries: Operation Daybreak, which focused on the notorious Beechwood children's home in Nottingham, and Operation Xeres, which probed residential homes across the county.\n\nThe progress so far is nothing short of remarkable! Former social worker Andris Logins has been sentenced to 20 years behind bars, while two other men have been jailed for historical attacks unrelated to children's homes. And there's more to come - three additional trials are set to begin in early 2017!\n\nNottinghamshire Police remains tight-lipped about the details, as the investigation is still ongoing.

Although Alex Wall snatched a consolation goal for Bromley, Cheltenham's dominant performance earned them a well-deserved win. The Robins remain second in the table, just one point behind Forest Green Rovers, while Bromley slipped to 14th with only one win in their last 11 games. After the match, Cheltenham Town boss Gary Johnson praised his team's performance, telling BBC Radio Gloucestershire: \"It's the best we've played for a little while. We've still been getting the results, but I enjoyed the way we played today - we created lots of chances.

This move is expected to generate an additional \u00a37 million in revenue, but the council still faces a significant budget shortfall of \u00a367 million. Council leader Frank McAveety emphasized that the tax hike will support essential services while protecting the city's most vulnerable residents. Notably, one in four households will not be affected by the increase, and the council will be able to avoid around \u00a37 million in cuts that would have impacted every community in the city.\n\nThe average council tax bill in Glasgow, which falls under the Band D category, currently stands at \u00a31,213, slightly higher than the national average of \u00a31,149. However, households in bands E, F, G, and H will see their bills increase automatically due to changes implemented this year, even before the 3% across-the-board rise takes effect.\n\nThe council tax increase is set to take effect just weeks before the May council elections, which may have significant implications for local politics. Labour-run councils in the west of Scotland, including South Lanarkshire, West Dunbartonshire, and others, are still deciding on their council tax plans. While some Labour councillors believe that raising council tax would merely limit cuts rather than eliminate them, others argue that not increasing the tax would be seen as a failure to utilize available means to mitigate cuts.\n\nThe Scottish government has pledged to provide additional funding for local services in the coming financial year, including new money generated through council tax changes and cash allocated to headteachers to support attainment-raising schemes. A final decision on Glasgow's council tax is expected to be made in February.", "Sustainable Shetland, a determined group of locals fiercely opposed to the massive wind farm project, has declared its intention to challenge the Scottish government's decision to greenlight the development in court. The proposed wind farm, which would be the third largest in Scotland, is spearheaded by Viking Energy, a community-driven company. Despite widespread protests, Energy Minister Fergus Ewing gave the project the thumbs-up in April. Critics argue that the sprawling development would irreparably scar the pristine Shetland landscape, while proponents claim it would inject a significant \u00a330 million into the local economy each year, create new job opportunities, and play a crucial role in meeting Scotland's ambitious renewable energy goals. The 370-megawatt wind farm is designed to power an astonishing 175,000 homes, a staggering number considering Shetland's modest population of just 22,000 residents.", "Ugandan opposition leader Kizza Besigye has been charged with treason after being arrested on Wednesday in Kampala and taken to Moroto, where he is being held in custody. This is not the first time Besigye has been arrested during the recent election campaign.

Museveni has since been sworn in for his fifth term, extending his 30-year rule of Uganda. However, foreign observers have criticized the election, saying it was marred by fear and intimidation. Museveni has denied allegations of vote rigging and accused Besigye of planning to incite violence. The US has called on Museveni to control his security forces, who briefly arrested Besigye and used tear gas on his supporters.", "German national team coach Joachim L\u00f6w has announced his 23-man squad for the upcoming European Championship, with several notable inclusions and omissions. Midfielder Marco Reus, 27, has been left out of the team due to ongoing injury concerns, which have plagued him since missing the 2014 World Cup. Fellow midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger, 31, has been selected despite not having played since March due to a knee injury sustained while on international duty.\n\nOther notable omissions from the squad include Bayer Leverkusen's Julian Brandt and Karim Bellarabi, as well as Hoffenheim's Sebastian Rudy. Coach L\u00f6w cited Reus's uncertain injury prognosis as the reason for his exclusion, stating, \"The medical staff could not provide a clear outlook for Marco's recovery, and we were skeptical about his ability to withstand the demands of the tournament.\"\n\nThe selected squad includes Liverpool midfielder Emre Can, Arsenal's Mesut \u00d6zil, and former Gunner Lukas Podolski, now playing for Galatasaray.

Platini claims he provided information to the investigation as a witness, but Swiss Attorney General Michael Lauber contradicts this, stating that Platini was investigated as both a witness and a suspect. Lauber also announced plans to search UEFA headquarters as part of the investigation.\n\nThe allegations center on a payment made to Platini for work he completed nearly a decade earlier. The timing of the payment, just two months before UEFA backed Blatter's 2011 presidential campaign, has raised suspicions. Platini claims he was told that FIFA couldn't pay him in full due to financial constraints, but FIFA's accounts show a revenue surplus of $83 million during the period he worked as a technical adviser.\n\nFIFA has been embroiled in corruption scandals this year, with both US and Swiss authorities launching separate investigations. Blatter is also suspected of signing a contract unfavorable to FIFA. Despite the criminal proceedings, Blatter plans to remain in his role until next year, when he is scheduled to step down.

While he tips reigning champion Mark Selby as the favorite to win, he's confident in his own abilities and is riding high on mental momentum.\n\n\"The nerves are always there, but I'm more relaxed this year,\" Higgins revealed. \"I've had some fantastic sessions, including against Mark Allen and in the second session against Kyren. To win this event, you need to dominate your opponents, and I believe I have the game to do just that.\"\n\nHiggins would love to face his fellow Scot, Stephen Maguire, in the semi-final, guaranteeing a Scottish presence in the final. \"Stephen's a great player, and I hope he comes through,\" Higgins said. \"If he beats me, I'll be the first to cheer him on to his first world title.

The incident occurred in January 2015, when Richard allegedly paid for the girl and her 15-year-old friend to travel from Norwich to London. He then took them to a flat in Bishopsgate, where he spanked the younger girl and had sex with her.\n\nRichard denies the allegations, claiming that the sex was consensual and that he reasonably believed the girl was over 16. He also claims that the \u00a3480 he gave to the girls was for travel expenses.\n\nThe prosecution presented evidence that Richard met the girl through a US website where he listed himself as a \"sugar daddy\" and she listed herself as a \"sugar baby.\" In an iChat exchange, Richard asked the girl for a revealing photograph, and she replied, \"You are my new daddy, I will do anything to keep you happy.\"\n\nThe girls traveled to London on January 2, 2015, and met Richard at a cafe near Liverpool Street station. Richard asked their ages, and they told him they were 16 and 17. However, police were alerted after the mother of the older girl noticed a PayPal deposit in her bank account. An examination of the 13-year-old girl on January 4 revealed an injury consistent with sexual activity.\n\nRichard was arrested the following day at the Lord Milner Hotel in Belgravia, where he reportedly said, \"As you can see, I am in a lot of trouble.\" The trial is ongoing.", "On Saturday, vandals damaged 11 cables in Ealing, disrupting services for residents in London and parts of the South East.

The devastating crash has sparked a flurry of lawsuits, including one from the family of Steven Craenmehr, a Dutch music executive who was fatally knocked off his bike. His widow and mother are taking SXSW organizers to task, claiming they failed to implement adequate traffic safeguards to protect pedestrians during the event, which draws thousands of music lovers to venues across Austin.\n\nThe lawsuit pulls no punches, stating that \"a festival organizer or traffic design consultant of ordinary intelligence would have anticipated the danger.\" But SXSW lawyers are fighting back, saying the tragedy was solely the result of Owens' \"utter disregard of human life.\" They're pointing to the fact that Owens drove his car through a barricade while allegedly drunk, with a blood alcohol level of .114 - well above the legal limit in Texas.\n\nThe incident has raised serious questions about safety at SXSW, with a recent report warning that the festival is at a \"critical point where public safety could be compromised\" if changes aren't made. The report cited overcrowding and excessive drinking as major concerns, but SXSW organizers have dismissed it as incomplete and inadequate. As the festival continues to be a launching pad for rising music stars, the debate over safety and responsibility is sure to rage on.", "Golden Glory: Mills and Clark's Sailing Dream Comes True!\n\nThe dynamic duo of Mills and Clark sailed their way to the top, upgrading their London silver to Olympic gold in the women's 470 event at Rio 2016!

For starters, they're thinking of building a brand new propylene production unit, with Belgium being one of the potential locations. They're also planning to supercharge their ethylene capacity at their Grangemouth site in Scotland and Rafnes in Norway. And here's the interesting part: both of these projects rely on fracked shale gas being shipped in from the US. Why's that a big deal? Well, ethylene and propylene are the essential building blocks for making plastics.\n\nAccording to Ineos, this investment will give their plants in Grangemouth and Rafnes a major boost, increasing their ethylene production by around 50% to over one million tonnes each. And the best part? This expansion is expected to create around 150 new jobs at each location once it's all complete in three to four years.\n\nGerd Franken from Ineos explained, \"These new projects will make us more self-sufficient when it comes to key olefin products, and give our derivative businesses and polymer plants in Europe an extra edge. Plus, we'll be able to tap into competitive raw materials from the US and beyond, which will benefit all our assets.\"", "Uber's board of directors has unanimously adopted the recommendations of a report by former US Attorney General Eric Holder, which was prompted by allegations of sexual harassment and a toxic company culture. The report's contents will be released on Tuesday. As a result, Emil Michael, a senior executive, has departed the company, although it is unclear whether he resigned or was fired. The move is seen by some as a necessary step to protect CEO Travis Kalanick, who has been under fire for his leadership style and behavior.\n\nKalanick's future at the company remains uncertain, with some speculating that he may be forced to take a leave of absence or have his role altered. The board discussed these options during a seven-hour meeting on Sunday. Kalanick has been on bereavement leave following the death of his mother and has faced criticism for his abrasive leadership style, including a video that showed him berating an Uber driver.\n\nThe Holder report is expected to recommend greater controls on spending, human resources, and other areas where executives have had too much autonomy. The company, which has over 12,000 employees, has faced numerous scandals and controversies, including the firing of 20 staff members last week after an investigation into complaints of sexual harassment, discrimination, and bullying.\n\nDespite these challenges, Uber's board is taking steps to address its cultural problems, including the appointment of three high-profile female directors in the past week. The company, valued at $68 billion, is still privately owned and has yet to turn a profit, despite generating $6.5 billion in revenue last year.

The existing bridge was blamed for nearly causing damage to a nearby Grade I-listed church during the 2014 floods. Dorset County Council, in collaboration with the Environment Agency, has ensured that the new bridge will maintain the character of the original while incorporating as many of the original bricks as possible.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has predictably called for Qasab's swift execution, arguing that those who wage war against the country and kill innocents deserve no mercy. However, Qasab still has the option to appeal to the highest court for a review of the verdict, and his last resort lies in a plea for clemency to the president.\n\nWhile Qasab's heinous crime of killing innocents undoubtedly qualifies as a \"rarest of the rare crime,\" which is the condition for imposing the death penalty in India, critics argue that there is no evidence to prove that capital punishment deters crime. In fact, two-thirds of the world's countries have abolished the death penalty in law or in practice. Last year, 63 countries imposed death sentences, but only 21 carried out executions, according to Amnesty International.\n\nIndia has been hesitant to execute people in recent years. In the past 12 years, there have been only two hangings, and most convicts on death row can expect their sentences to be commuted to life. Former President Pratibha Patil commuted the death sentences of 35 convicts during her term. Currently, 29 clemency pleas, including that of Afzal Guru, who was convicted of attacking the Indian parliament in 2001, are pending before the president.\n\nMoreover, there is a practical problem: India has only one or two hangmen available. I met one such hangman in a Calcutta prison two years ago, who was still waiting to carry out his first execution. Recently, 14 retired Indian judges wrote to the president, urging him to commute the death sentences of 13 inmates. The Supreme Court itself has acknowledged that some of the death penalties it upheld were erroneous.\n\nAs AP Shah, the former chief justice of the Delhi High Court, notes, \"Public opinion in India can no longer ignore the global movement in favour of abolishing the death penalty.\" What do you think?", "The operation to remove 3,000 tonnes of water from the Hoegh Osaka is expected to take until Sunday, but bad weather has delayed the salvors' plans.

This significant decline is largely due to the increased costs of doing business in the UK, including an additional \u00a344m in gambling duties. The company has been adapting to major changes in the taxation of online betting and fixed-odds betting terminals.\n\nDespite this setback, William Hill is looking to the future with optimism. The company has invested $25m (\u00a316m) in a 29.4% stake in NeoGames, a leading online lottery firm with a strong presence in the US market. This strategic move is expected to drive long-term growth and tap into the lucrative US lottery market, where spending per head is the highest in the world.\n\nCEO James Henderson remains confident, saying, \"We've delivered a solid operational performance despite the significant regulatory and taxation changes in our industry. While these changes have impacted our costs, we're committed to investing in our growth drivers and building a strong foundation for the future.\"\n\nThe company's net revenues have seen a slight increase to \u00a3808.1m, but one-off costs related to rebranding its Australian operations have also taken a toll on profits. Additionally, the introduction of the National Living Wage is expected to cost William Hill around \u00a31m-\u00a32m in 2016.\n\nHowever, the acquisition of NeoGames is a promising development, with Henderson describing the online lottery market as an \"exciting opportunity.\" With an option to buy the remaining 70.6% of NeoGames in the future, William Hill is poised to capitalize on this growing market. Despite the current challenges, the company's forward-thinking approach is likely to pay off in the long run.", "Widnes Vikings are currently top of the Super League table after seven games, with 230 points scored and only Wigan and Warrington conceding fewer.

According to Prof. Terry Hughes from the National Coral Bleaching Taskforce, the link between bleaching and global warming is \"very well established,\" and the clock is ticking to save the reef.\n\nRising water temperatures, fueled by climate change and El Ni\u00f1o, are causing corals to expel their vibrant algae, leaving them ghostly white and vulnerable to death. The taskforce's comprehensive survey reveals that a staggering 93% of the reef is affected, with the northern section bearing the brunt of the damage.\n\nProf. Hughes warns that the window of opportunity to save the reef is rapidly closing. \"If we don't take drastic action on global warming, the Great Barrier Reef will become increasingly degraded. We're already seeing a shift in coral species, and if these bleaching events continue to occur every five to 10 years, the reef will struggle to recover.\"\n\nThe economic implications are dire, with the reef generating AU$5 billion annually and supporting 70,000 jobs. While some areas of the reef remain healthy, the Queensland Tourism Industry Council acknowledges that coral bleaching cannot be ignored. \"We can't just hope for a swift recovery; we need to take action to protect the reef,\" said CEO Daniel Gschwind.\n\nThe Australian government has pledged AU$2 billion over the next decade to safeguard the reef, but experts agree that more needs to be done to address the root cause of the problem: global warming. The fate of the Great Barrier Reef hangs in the balance, and the world is watching. Will we act in time to save this natural treasure?", "Manchester United has landed its first signing under David Moyes' leadership, and it's a big one!

Prosecutors claim the whole thing was planned by Pakistan's intelligence agency and carried out by a militant group with help from a banned Indian group.

Although he stopped short of calling for a full public inquiry, he emphasized the need to learn from the project's mistakes. \n\nSpeaking in the Scottish Parliament, Salmond said, \"While it's a relief to see the trams up and running, we must not ignore the significant public concern over the project's conduct and the disruption it has caused. That's why I've recommended a judge-led inquiry to establish what went wrong and how we can prevent similar mistakes in the future.\"\n\nThe inquiry will focus on why the project experienced significant delays and cost increases, as well as the reduction in its original scope. The City of Edinburgh Council has assured the government of its full cooperation with the inquiry. \n\nSalmond's announcement came in response to a question from Marco Biagi, an SNP MSP who has long opposed the tram project. Biagi emphasized the need for transparency and accountability, stating, \"We need to know that these mistakes will never be repeated if we're to have any faith in future project management and cost estimates.\"\n\nThe tram project has been beset by problems since its inception, with the price doubling, the network halving, and the construction time taking twice as long as originally planned.

Sarah Sands, a 32-year-old woman, is on trial for murdering her 77-year-old neighbor, Michael Pleasted. But here's the thing - Pleasted was a alleged child abuser, and Sands had just found out about it. In fact, he was out on bail, awaiting trial for sexually assaulting two kids under 13, and the police were investigating another allegation of abuse against a third boy.\n\nSands had actually befriended Pleasted, who ran a little bric-a-brac shop from a convenience store. She'd visit him at his flat and even bring him meals. But once she learned about the abuse allegations, everything changed. She armed herself with a knife, drank two bottles of wine and a bottle of brandy, and headed to his flat. CCTV footage shows she was there for about 20 minutes. Tragically, Pleasted was stabbed eight times.\n\nAfter the stabbing, Sands went to the Isle of Dogs, where she ditched the knife and her clothes in a carrier bag. Before turning herself in, she confessed to a family friend, saying \"I stabbed him.\" In her police interview, she claimed she was trying to help Pleasted, but he was still abusing kids.

The organisations claim that Australia's actions are designed to discourage other migrants from attempting to reach its shores.\n\nThe damning allegations include claims of rape and assault at the hands of Nauruan locals, cramped and uncomfortable living conditions, and a lack of access to proper medical care. One woman was forced to marry a man 15 years her senior just to feel safe, while another was driven into the jungle by Nauruan men with the intent of raping her.\n\nDespite most detainees being identified as genuine refugees and released into the community, many are too afraid to leave their accommodations, especially at night. The report also alleges that Nauruan police often downplay or ignore reports of abuse made by asylum seekers.\n\nIn response, the Australian Immigration Department has hit back, accusing Amnesty International of not consulting with the government before releasing the report. However, the organisations stand by their findings, which are based on interviews with 84 refugees and asylum seekers.\n\nThe detention centre on Nauru is operated by Broadspectrum, a company contracted by the Australian government, while medical services are provided by International Health and Medical Services. The Australian government has welcomed independent scrutiny of its facilities, but the report's findings raise serious questions about its commitment to protecting the human rights of asylum seekers.", "In the midst of a heated election season, Welsh voters are making it clear that healthcare is a top priority.

But Davies remained undeterred, promising that a Conservative government would safeguard health spending and introduce a cancer drugs fund. When questioned about campaigning on an issue largely outside Westminster's control, Davies countered that it was only fair to highlight the differences between his party's vision and Labour's record on healthcare.\n\nLabour's Deputy Health Minister Vaughan Gething shot back, accusing the Tories of secretly plotting to privatize the NHS. \"They've had three chances to rule out privatization, and they've refused,\" Gething charged. He painted a stark choice for voters: \"Do you want a Labour government that will invest in the NHS and train more doctors and nurses, or a Tory government that will introduce a 'tablet tax' and sell off health services?\"\n\nMeanwhile, Welsh Lib Dem leader Kirsty Williams was on the campaign trail, promising to improve rural healthcare by investing in cottage hospitals and community care. \"We need an urgent care center in Montgomeryshire to take the pressure off A&E departments and cut waiting times,\" Williams urged.\n\nPlaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood, meanwhile, accused her rivals of neglecting the economy of north Wales. \"It's time for governments in Cardiff and London to invest in the north and give it the vision it deserves,\" Wood declared.

They also emphasized their regular meetings with English Heritage to ensure compliance with listed building regulations.\n\nBut English Heritage raised concerns about the cumulative impact of the signs on the historic buildings in West Mall and Caledonia Place. In a letter, they cautioned that the signs could potentially alter the character of the listed buildings and suggested that the council seek listed building consent to carefully consider the impact of the works.\n\nThe stakes are high, as numbers one to 31 Caledonia Place, including their attached basement railings, are treasured for their special architectural and historic significance.

Native to South East Asia, the moths are a common sight in the region, but their recent mass appearance has left many wondering if this is a new phenomenon. According to biology lecturer N Sivasothi, while the sightings may seem unprecedented, the moths are actually present throughout the year, albeit in smaller numbers, making them easily overlooked. The moths typically emerge between April and August, and their navigation system, which relies on light, often leads them to urban areas in search of new host plants.\n\nExperts reassure that the nocturnal creatures pose no threat to humans, despite concerns from asthma sufferers who may be sensitive to the hairs on their wings. \"The moths are harmless, and the public has nothing to fear,\" said Lena Chan, Director of the National Biodiversity Centre at the National Parks Board in Singapore. \"In fact, they play a vital role as pollinators and are a delight to observe.\" While many Malaysians and Singaporeans welcomed the moths with open arms, sharing their encounters and photographs online, others remained cautious, citing cultural beliefs such as the Chinese superstition that moths symbolize death and should not be disturbed.", "The Madagascar pochard, a critically endangered duck species, is on the brink of extinction due to human activity. According to a study published in Bird Conservation International, only 25 individual birds remain in the wild, confined to a single wetland in north-east Madagascar. The Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT), which led the research, estimates that 96% of the chicks die at just two to three weeks old due to starvation.\n\nThe wetland, a complex of lakes near Bemanevika, lacks sufficient food for the ducks, which feed from the bottom of lakes. Despite the efforts of conservationists, including the WWT, the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, and the Peregrine Fund, the population continues to decline. Dr. Geoff Hilton, head of species research at the WWT, notes that with such a small number of birds, monitoring the population is straightforward, but the results are devastating.\n\nThe researchers have identified the problem: the steep crater lake is too deep for the diving ducks, and the chicks are starving to death. This is a classic wildlife conservation conundrum, where the last refuge of a species is not suitable for its needs, but is the only place that has not been destroyed by human activities.\n\nHowever, there is hope. The captive-bred ducks could thrive in Madagascar again if a new wetland home can be found. The researchers have identified a potential reintroduction site and are working with local people to restore the lake and reintroduce the pochard. Dr. Hilton emphasizes that the key to success lies in working with the local community to restore the lake and improve their livelihoods.", "The Ireland cricket team has announced its squad for the upcoming week-long round-robin T20 tournament, which aims to provide more experience to the eight associate countries involved.

The Ireland squad sees the return of experienced internationals Boyd Rankin, Stuart Thompson, and Andrew Balbirnie, who missed most of the 2016 campaign due to injuries and performance anxiety.\n\nHowever, Niall O'Brien has been left out of the squad, with Gary Wilson selected as the only wicket-keeper. Tim Murtagh, the Middlesex seamer, has also been omitted. On the other hand, Jacob Mulder and Josh Little have retained their places in the T20 squad following their debuts against Hong Kong, while Greg Thompson's impressive return after an eight-year absence has earned him a spot on the tour.\n\nThe full Ireland squad is: W Porterfield (capt), A Balbirnie, G Dockrell, J Little, J Mulder, A McBrine, B McCarthy, K O'Brien, B Rankin, P Stirling, G Thompson, S Thompson, G Wilson, C Young.", "Hywel Dda University Health Board is proposing to adjust the operating hours of the paediatric ambulatory care unit (PACU) at Withybush Hospital to ensure safe and consistent care for children. Due to a shortage of consultant paediatricians, the health board recommends reducing the unit's daily hours by four hours. This change would see the PACU open from 10:00 to 18:00 GMT, instead of the current 10:00 to 22:00 GMT.\n\nThe PACU provides essential care to children experiencing sudden illnesses or injuries, including high temperatures, infections, and those requiring dressings, blood tests, or imaging services. If the proposal is approved, children requiring assessment outside of the new operating hours would be transferred to Glangwili Hospital in Carmarthen.\n\nThe health board attributes the need for this change to the ongoing challenge of recruiting paediatric consultants nationwide, exacerbated by the recent retirement of a local paediatric consultant and another's maternity leave. Doing nothing, the health board warns, would pose a significant risk to patient safety and public confidence.\n\nTo further mitigate the impact, the health board suggests merging the on-call rota with the one in Carmarthenshire. This would enable paediatric consultants to provide remote advice in emergency situations, ensuring timely and effective care.\n\nAccording to Steve Moore, the health board's chief executive, \"We must be pragmatic about our consultant availability and plan care accordingly to ensure safety, consistency, and avoid public confusion. Otherwise, we risk unplanned closures, compromising patient safety and public trust.\" The health board continues to actively recruit paediatric consultants to address the shortage.", "The match erupted into action early on as Stirling's Lewis McLear rattled the post with a thunderous strike!

Mr. \u00d3 Muilleoir welcomed the idea, saying that any initiative that promotes dialogue and understanding is a positive step.\n\nCurrently, talks between Stormont's parties to form an executive have been put on hold until after Easter. Despite six weeks having passed since the assembly election, a deal has yet to be reached. One of Sinn F\u00e9in's top priorities in the talks is the implementation of an Irish Language Act. However, in February, Arlene Foster stated that the DUP would never agree to such an act.\n\nIn a recent shift, Mrs. Foster has expressed her willingness to meet with individuals who genuinely love the Irish language and do not intend to use it as a political tool. Mr. \u00d3 Muilleoir hopes that she will listen carefully to the views of Irish speakers, who are united in their demand for an Irish Language Act. He believes that Mrs. Foster will discover that the Irish language community is diverse, comprising individuals with various political views and none, who are united in their belief that Irish is a shared cultural treasure.\n\nMr. \u00d3 Muilleoir added that it is too early to determine the DUP's stance on an Irish Language Act, but the meeting will be beneficial for both Mrs. Foster and the Irish language community.

Maloney cited the national team as a major factor in his decision, stating, \"The national team weighed heavily on my mind.\" He explained that the travel back for international games was proving more difficult than he had anticipated, affecting his ability to be \"physically 100% able for training and matches.\"\n\nMaloney, who has earned 40 international caps, played in both of Scotland's matches in the spring, including a friendly against Northern Ireland and a Euro 2016 Group D qualifying match against Gibraltar. He also played in the friendly against Qatar and the Euro 2016 qualifier against the Republic of Ireland in June. Earlier this week, he was named to the Scotland squad for next month's Euro qualifiers against Georgia and Germany.\n\nMaloney attributed his decision to leave Chicago to a combination of personal and professional reasons. \"I still had a real desire to achieve something in British football,\" he said. Although he enjoyed his time in Chicago, he felt that the football didn't work out as hoped. He also wanted to ensure that he didn't give the national manager any excuses for not performing well due to travel fatigue.\n\nMaloney didn't consult with Scotland boss Gordon Strachan about his move to Hull, but was drawn to the Championship club due to the presence of manager Steve Bruce. \"Once I made it known that I was going to come back, it was two or three weeks ago that Hull showed an interest in me. That's when a decision had to be made,\" he explained. Maloney is eager to help Hull secure promotion to the Premier League, stating, \"Everything is geared up to get the team back into the Premier League.\"\n\nScotland currently sits third in Group D qualifying, behind Poland and Germany.

What a weekend for this speed sensation!", "Four sailors, James Male, Andrew Bridge, Steve Warren, and Paul Goslin, tragically lost their lives when their yacht, Cheeki Rafiki, capsized in the North Atlantic. Prosecutors at Winchester Crown Court allege that Douglas Innes, the yacht's manager, failed to ensure the vessel was properly inspected before its ill-fated trip. Innes, 42, denies four counts of manslaughter by gross negligence and an additional charge of failing to ensure the yacht was operated safely. The court heard that the yacht had been given a category 2 code, limiting its commercial use to within 60 miles of a safe haven, but the certificate had expired shortly before the tragedy. The sailors were returning from Antigua Sailing Week to Southampton when the yacht overturned in May 2014. According to prosecutor Nigel Lickley QC, Innes received an urgent email from Andrew Bridge on board the yacht but failed to call the coastguard, instead going to another pub. When Bridge called again, saying the situation had worsened, Innes returned home, contacted the coastguard, and emailed the crew to check the keel bolts. Tragically, it was later discovered that several bolts had failed or broken, causing the keel to detach from the yacht. The court was told that the keel's loss would have resulted in a rapid capsize, with those on deck being thrown into the water and those inside trapped. Emergency beacons used by Bridge and Male suggest they may have survived for some time in the water before being lost. The US Coastguard initially called off its search after two days, but following protests and government intervention, it was restarted, and the yacht was eventually found. The trial is ongoing.", "Borja, a 23-year-old striker, has joined Swansea City for a club-record \u00a315m fee, following Fernando Llorente's transfer from Sevilla.

I'm confident we'll work well together and do what's best for the team.\"\n\nBorn in Madrid, Borja developed his skills at Atletico Madrid's academy but spent the last five seasons on loan. He admitted, \"I'm frustrated that I didn't get to play much at Atletico, but I'm eager to make a fresh start.\" Last season, he scored 18 goals in La Liga while playing for Eibar.\n\nDespite interest from other La Liga and Premier League clubs, Borja revealed that Swansea's enthusiasm for his signature made his decision easy. \"Swansea showed the most interest and seemed to want me the most. It's a great club that trusts its players, and I'm determined to make a good impression.\"\n\nUnlike Llorente, a veteran of Spain's 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012-winning teams, Borja has yet to receive a senior call-up for his country. However, he draws inspiration from former Swansea striker Michu, who earned a cap for Spain after a successful season with the club. Borja hopes to follow in Michu's footsteps, saying, \"If I can score as many goals as Michu did and help the team in every way possible, it could lead to national selection and be a great achievement for both Swansea and myself.\"", "In the midst of Rosh Hashanah celebrations on Monday, law enforcement responded to an incident on Bury Old Road in Greater Manchester, an area densely populated by the Orthodox Jewish community.

As a result, about 20% of gas stations are either out of fuel or running super low.\n\nFrench Twitter users are having a blast, referencing movie titles and making them all about the fuel shortage. For example, Total Recall (a sci-fi flick from 1990 and 2012) is a big deal because Total is also the name of a French oil and gas company. Some people are even changing movie titles to make them funny - like Pulp Fiction becoming Pump Friction, The Full Monty becoming The Fuel Monty, and Mad Max: Fury Road becoming Mad Max: Fury Bicycle Lane (lol!).\n\nVin Diesel's movies are also getting a lot of attention, with people coming up with new titles like Last and Furious, Pas Fast Mais Furious (which means \"Not Fast But Furious\" in French), Immobile and Furious, and Fuel Furious. And Eminem's 8 Mile is now 0 Mile or 8 Miles a Pied (which means \"8 Miles on Foot\" in French).\n\nStanley Kubrick fans are also getting in on the action, referencing his movies like Full Metal Jacket (which became Fuel Metal Jacket) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (which is called 2001, l'Odyssee de l'espace in French - and \"espace\" is also the name of a Renault minivan, which is pretty funny!).\n\nAnd because people are filling up jerrycans at gas stations, those are getting worked into movie titles too - like Tom and Jerrrycan, Jerrycan Beauty, and Catch Me If You Jerrycan.

Woods, 40, had a mixed round, with four birdies in eight holes, but struggled with a wayward drive and poor chip on the ninth hole, resulting in a bogey. He dropped another shot on the 11th, and double bogeys on the 16th and 18th left him one stroke over par. Despite this, Woods expressed optimism, saying he \"felt pretty good\" and was \"looking forward to the next few days.\" He acknowledged making mistakes, including hitting the ball into three bushes and the water, but was encouraged by his solid start. Woods attributed his struggles to not driving well, which made it difficult to take advantage of the course. His double bogeys came from a pulled approach shot on the 16th and a drive into a lake on the 18th.

The project, a pumped storage hydro scheme, is part of a larger effort to redevelop the former opencast mine into the Glenmuckloch Energy Park. The plan involves creating two reservoirs connected by a tunnel with a pump-turbine, which will store excess energy by pumping water from the lower reservoir to the upper one, and then release it to generate power when needed. The project is a collaboration between Buccleuch Estates, Hargreaves, and 2020 Renewables, and is expected to create 3.3 million cubic meters of water storage. The redevelopment of the site follows the collapse of a previous mining company, and is part of a larger effort to restore the area. Other renewable energy projects are also planned for the site, including two community wind turbines and an eight-turbine wind farm.", "East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust, which operates Conquest Hospital in Hastings and Eastbourne District General Hospital, is currently rated as \"inadequate\" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC). According to sources, the trust has failed to demonstrate significant improvement and is likely to be placed under special measures during a meeting scheduled for Friday. The trust has declined to comment, citing the forthcoming publication of a CQC report.\n\nNotably, East Kent Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Medway NHS Foundation Trust are already under special measures. Medway's Maritime Hospital recently had to divert ambulances to alleviate pressure on its Accident and Emergency department.\n\nThe East Sussex trust received an \"inadequate\" rating from the CQC in March, following its failure to meet government targets. Subsequently, in May, Eastbourne Borough Council passed a vote of no confidence in the trust's management. Furthermore, in July, the chief executive resigned, and the trust issued an apology after patients' personal details were found in a public area.\n\nThe CQC's March report highlighted a \"disconnect between the trust board and its staff\" and a \"culture of fear\" that discouraged staff from speaking out. Despite widespread awareness of the trust's challenges, tangible progress towards improvement has been lacking. It is understood that the CQC believes little has changed in recent months.\n\nFriday's meeting will provide an opportunity for stakeholders to discuss the trust's future direction. However, many within the NHS community expect special measures to be imposed on the trust. When approached for comment, a trust spokesperson stated, \"We are awaiting the publication of the CQC report next week and will refrain from making any further comment until the report is published and any recommendations are made.\"", "A former student of Haggerston Girls' School in Hackney, east London, Lisa Doughty, 47, has been diagnosed with mesothelioma. She believes her illness may be linked to asbestos exposure during her time at the school in the 1980s. Doughty recalls the music desks being frequently covered in dust, which may have contained asbestos particles. She spent a significant amount of time in the music room each week, rehearsing plays, and remembers having to wipe off white dust from the desks. The room's heavy doors would constantly slam, causing the room to shake, and Doughty suspects that the dust may have come from the ceiling.\n\nIf it is proven that the music room was the cause of her cancer, Doughty fears that many others may have been affected. She is urging anyone else who has been impacted, including former pupils and teachers, to come forward. Doughty's lawyers, Slater and Gordon, have discovered that asbestos ceiling tiles were present in the school during her time there and are considering further legal action.\n\nA Hackney Council spokesperson acknowledged that asbestos was widely used in buildings, including Haggerston School, due to its fire-resistant properties. The school has undergone regular condition and asbestos surveys and removals. Edmund Young, an asbestos-related disease specialist, notes that mesothelioma is increasingly affecting not only industrial workers but also teachers and former students who have inhaled asbestos particles while at school.", "Ulster Rugby is thrilled to announce that 29-year-old Chris Henry has pledged his future to the province, joining Ruan Pienaar, Nick Williams, and Robbie Diack in committing to the team long-term! \"I'm absolutely over the moon to have signed on with Ulster for the long haul,\" Henry exclaimed. \"This is an incredible team to be a part of, and I know we've got some unfinished business to take care of - we're hungry for that silverware!\" With eight caps for Ireland and 109 appearances for Ulster under his belt, Henry is more determined than ever to bring home a trophy to the province after coming so close in recent years.

In fact, their share of Indonesia AirAsia's net loss was a whopping 155.7 million Malaysian ringgit. But don't worry, they're working on turning things around. They're planning to increase capacity in the fourth quarter to cash in on the holiday season demand. This news comes on the heels of AirAsia X, their long-haul service, reporting its eighth straight quarter of losses.

The air is electric with slogans like \"Free Kanhaiya Kumar\" and \"Long live revolution\" as hundreds of agitated students pour into the area. At the center of the controversy is Kanhaiya Kumar, the leader of the university's student union, who has been accused of sedition and arrested by the police.\n\nThe students are adamant that Kumar is innocent and that the police's actions were unjustified. They claim that Kumar did not organize the event commemorating Afzal Guru's hanging, where \"anti-India slogans\" were allegedly raised. In fact, many students are willing to defend Kumar, but only on condition of anonymity, fearing for their safety.\n\nStudent activist Shreya Ghosh reveals the climate of fear that pervades the university. \"We've been sleeping in different rooms every night to avoid arrest,\" she says. Another activist, Deepshita, believes that ideological politics is behind Kumar's arrest, with right-wing students seeking to increase their influence on campus.\n\nAs the protest gains momentum, speakers become more vociferous in their criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP party. Professor Ajith Kanna takes the stage, declaring, \"If Kanhaiya is anti-national, then I am also anti-national.\" He urges the students to remain peaceful and not to believe rumors, which are spreading like wildfire across the campus.\n\nOne such rumor claims that over 100 armed right-wing activists have infiltrated the campus. I meet Saurabh Kumar, a member of the right-wing student group Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), who insists that the law will decide Kumar's guilt or innocence, but that anti-India activities will not be tolerated on campus.\n\nNot all students, however, are caught up in the protests.

Both possess an undeniable charm that elevates them above the ordinary and makes them truly exceptional. Singapore, in particular, has become the go-to destination for business deals, rivaling Monaco as the premier hub for networking during a grand prix weekend. Its allure is undeniable, making it one of the most coveted races on the calendar. The atmosphere is electric, and it's not just the thrill of racing on one of the longest and most challenging tracks in F1 that draws in the crowds. Singapore's unique blend of Asian and colonial heritage makes it a fascinating destination in its own right. The nighttime race adds an extra layer of excitement, with the track weaving through the city center under the glow of lights, Chinese lanterns adding a pop of color, and the futuristic skyline serving as a stunning backdrop. As the sun dips below the horizon, the entire city seems to come alive, shimmering and sparkling with an otherworldly energy. The tropical heat is tempered by the darkness, replaced by a lush, exotic atmosphere that envelops the entire area. For those working behind the scenes, the experience is nothing short of surreal. With track sessions starting at dusk, qualifying and racing under the stars, and staying on European time, the days blend together in a haze of activity.

This marks a 7% swing from the SNP, which had held the seat since the 2011 Holyrood election. The by-election was triggered by the resignation of former MSP Bill Walker, who was expelled from the SNP and jailed for domestic abuse.\n\nCara Hilton, the newly elected MSP, stated that the people of Dunfermline \"deserved better\" and vowed to ensure that her party would provide better representation than its predecessor. Hilton also took aim at the SNP administration, saying that it needed to focus on the real priorities of Scots rather than its \"constitutional obsession\" with the upcoming independence referendum.\n\nThe by-election campaign centered on local issues, including proposed school closures, with the SNP highlighting its national policies such as the council tax freeze and the removal of tolls on the Forth Road Bridge.

Drones, remotely controlled pilot-less aircraft, are being used by police to capture footage in hard-to-reach areas, such as cliffs. However, there are concerns that criminals are also exploiting this technology. In one instance, a drone was used to smuggle contraband into HMP Manchester, and there have been nine reported attempts to infiltrate prisons in England and Wales using drones. Additionally, a think tank has warned of the potential for terrorist groups to utilize drones. The UK Air Proximity Board has also reported four serious near-miss incidents involving drones at UK airports.\n\nThe proposed solution involves training birds of prey to take down drones, which they would perceive as prey. However, experts have raised concerns about the feasibility and safety of this approach. Jemima Parry-Jones, director of the International Centre of Birds of Prey, has dismissed the idea as a \"gimmick,\" citing the risks to both humans and birds.

Fast forward to today, and the project has achieved remarkable success. The farmed shellfish have secured the highest quality rating, earning a prestigious Class A classification for cleanliness. This achievement is a testament to the hard work and dedication of the Porlock Futures Community Interest Company, which spearheaded the trial.\n\nThe project's success is attributed to the use of oysters from Morecambe Bay in Lancashire, which were used to test the feasibility of farming shellfish in the seas around Porlock. According to Roger Hall, from the Community Interest Company, \"We've proved that the oysters not only grow but have achieved the highest cleanliness standards.\"\n\nThe project's progress has been remarkable, with 70 trestles now holding thousands of oysters ready to be served in local restaurants.

However, he believes they need to demonstrate their readiness in training and earn their place in the team.\n\n\"It's not about just giving out caps; it's about selecting the best players in each position,\" Phillips emphasized. \"The development of young players is crucial, but it needs to be done in a structured way.

The bill, which would make it a misdemeanor offense to use a public toilet or facility associated with a gender other than what is listed on one's birth certificate, has sparked outrage among transgender rights advocates.\n\n**Background**\n\nLast month, Arizona approved a human rights measure banning gender identity discrimination at public facilities. Meanwhile, two other states have passed laws ensuring equal access to gender-segregated facilities for transgender students.\n\n**The Bill's Provisions**\n\nIf passed, the bill would impose penalties of up to six months in prison for violators. Supporters of the bill, such as Republican lawmaker John Kavanagh, argue that it is necessary to prevent criminals from taking advantage of the situation and exposing themselves to children of the opposite gender.\n\n**Critics Speak Out**\n\nHowever, transgender rights advocates argue that the bill would force transgender people to reveal themselves and risk harassment. \"Most transgender people try to slip through public places without being noticed,\" said activist Erica Keppler. \"This will turn us into criminals.\"\n\n**Challenges in Changing Birth Certificates**\n\nAdvocates also point out that transgender people often face difficulties in changing their gender on their birth certificates, as many states require proof of gender treatment surgery. In some states, such as Idaho and Ohio, it is not possible to change one's birth certificate at all.\n\n**National Context**\n\nCurrently, 16 US states have laws in place to protect transgender people from discrimination, although the extent of these protections varies. A case in Colorado, where a six-year-old transgender girl was banned from using the girl's bathroom at her primary school, is ongoing.\n\n**Quote from Transgender Rights Lawyer**\n\n\"If you look like a man and you live your life like a man, you should be able to use a man's bathroom,\" said Dru Levasseur, a transgender rights lawyer for Lambda Legal.", "Two men, Ronnie Frost, 19, from High Street in Halmer End, and Joe Cordon, 21, from Eastbourne Road in Northwood, were taken into custody on Sunday evening.

An online appeal set up by beautician Katie Cutler raised an astonishing \u00a3330,135. Richard Gatiss, 25, from Gateshead, pleaded guilty to assault with intent to rob and was sentenced at Newcastle Crown Court. The victim, Mr. Barnes, felt the four-year sentence was appropriate and hoped Gatiss would use his time in prison to reflect on his actions. \"I hope he'll take this opportunity to think about what he's done and come out a better person, maybe even decide to help others,\" Mr. Barnes said. The court heard that Gatiss, desperate for money to buy legal highs, targeted Mr. Barnes due to his vulnerabilities. Mr. Barnes has lived with disabilities since birth and is visually impaired and only 4ft 6in tall. Judge Paul Sloan QC condemned Gatiss' actions as \"despicable and opportunistic.\" After the hearing, Mr. Barnes, accompanied by Miss Cutler, expressed relief at the sentence and hoped Gatiss would reform. Miss Cutler, holding back tears, wished for Gatiss to receive the help he needed. The defense argued that the publicity surrounding the case made it challenging to determine a fair sentence. Gatiss' father called for a ban on legal highs, while Northumbria Police welcomed the sentence, saying it would deter criminals from targeting vulnerable individuals.", "In the first half of August, nearly 4,000 migrants arrived in Quebec, seeking a safe haven and a chance to rebuild their lives. Many of them are Haitians who fear persecution if they remain in the US. Government officials are working hard to correct misinformation that may have led them to Canada's doorstep.\n\nAfter the devastating earthquake in Haiti in 2010, nearly 60,000 Haitians were granted temporary protection in the US. Although the Trump administration extended this protection until January 2018, Canada lifted its own protected status for Haitians last year. Unfortunately, about half of all asylum claims by Haitians were rejected in 2016.\n\nTo address the influx of migrants, federal officials are spreading the word that crossing the border irregularly is not a guarantee of residency. Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale emphasized that \"people should not think that border-hopping is a desirable or productive thing to do.\" Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen added that Canadian diplomatic staff in the US are working to dispel myths about Canada's asylum system, including the misconception that residency is guaranteed.\n\nTo reach out to the Haitian community, federal Liberal MP Emmanuel Dubourg, who is of Haitian origin and speaks Creole, is engaging with Haitian media in American cities like Miami and New York. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also addressed the issue, saying, \"Canada is an open and welcoming society, but we are also a country of laws. Entering Canada irregularly is not an advantage. There are rigorous immigration and customs rules that will be followed.\"\n\nDespite criticism from opposition politicians, Canadian officials are committed to providing a fair and compassionate response to the influx of migrants. Since January, 7,500 migrants have crossed into Canada, with the majority entering Quebec.

Despite most respondents having experience in treating children with eating disorders, the study found that many paediatricians were uncertain about how to identify underweight children and detect potential life-threatening complications.\n\nThe research, which involved surveying paediatricians at 177 hospitals, discovered that only half of the respondents would use Body Mass Index (BMI) to determine if older children or adolescents were underweight, as recommended by international guidelines. Furthermore, only one in five would adjust the BMI cut-offs for children. The study also highlighted a lack of awareness among paediatricians regarding the signs and symptoms of complications in children with severely low weights.\n\nThe researchers expressed particular concern that only 13% of paediatricians knew to look for a specific danger sign in tests checking heart function, and that many scored poorly on knowledge of dangerous complications associated with refeeding malnourished patients.\n\nStudy leader Dr. Lee Hudson emphasized that the findings were not intended to criticize paediatricians, but rather to highlight a gap in training. He noted that eating disorders often present with vague symptoms, making it essential for paediatricians to be equipped with the necessary knowledge to identify and manage these conditions effectively.\n\nDr. Hudson stressed that paediatricians are often the first point of contact for children with eating disorders, particularly outside of regular working hours, and therefore need to be able to recognize the signs of dangerous underweight and severe complications. He cited previous research indicating that a third of underweight children present with life-threatening features.\n\nIn response to the study's findings, the Royal College of Paediatrics has acknowledged the need for improved training in eating disorders and underweight issues. Prof. Russell Viner, a co-author of the study and member of the Royal College of Paediatrics Nutrition Committee, announced that the college is refreshing its training on adolescent health and developing a training program on mental health in adolescents in collaboration with the Department of Health and the Royal College of Psychiatry.", "In a groundbreaking move, China has announced that couples will now be allowed to have two children, marking a significant shift away from the country's decades-long one-child policy. This change is expected to bring a more balanced approach to population growth, addressing concerns about an aging population and shrinking workforce.\n\nIntroduced in 1979, the one-child policy was initially designed to slow down population growth, and it's estimated to have prevented around 400 million births. However, over time, the policy has been criticized for its strict enforcement, which included fines, job losses, and even forced abortions for those who violated the rules.\n\nAs China's population continues to age - with around 30% of its 1.36 billion citizens now over 50 - the government has recognized the need for change. By allowing couples to have two children, the Communist Party aims to promote a more sustainable population growth rate and address the social and economic challenges that come with an aging population.\n\nWhile this move is seen as a step in the right direction, some critics argue that it may not be enough to boost the birth rate significantly. Others point out that the state's control over women's fertility remains a concern, even with the relaxed rules.\n\nPersonal stories of those affected by the one-child policy highlight the emotional toll it has taken on families. For instance, one woman shares how her mother had to undergo two abortions due to the policy, and how she still wonders about the siblings she never had.\n\nExperts like Stuart Gietel-Basten, associate professor of social policy at the University of Oxford, see this reform as a pragmatic response to an unpopular policy that was no longer effective. The announcement comes as part of the Communist Party's fifth plenum, which also outlined growth targets and the country's next five-year plan.\n\nOverall, this shift in policy marks a significant turning point for China, as it seeks to find a more balanced approach to population growth and address the challenges of an aging population.", "James Anderson, the world's top-ranked Test bowler, is expected to miss Lancashire's next two County Championship games due to a stress fracture in his right shoulder blade. The injury occurred during the third Test against Sri Lanka. Anderson's absence comes at a crucial time, as England prepares to face Pakistan in a four-match series starting on July 14 at Lord's.\n\nDespite the setback, Anderson's recent performance in the Test series against Sri Lanka was impressive, taking 21 wickets across three matches, including 10 in the opening win at Headingley. His outstanding performance propelled him to the top of the International Cricket Council bowling rankings, surpassing teammate Stuart Broad.\n\nAnderson's availability for the Pakistan Test series will be determined by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and Lancashire's medical teams, who will continue to monitor and manage his recovery. This is not the first time Anderson has faced injury setbacks, having missed two Tests in the 2015 Ashes series with a side strain and the first Test against South Africa in December with a calf problem.\n\nLancashire has expressed its support for Anderson, wishing him a speedy recovery and hoping to see him back in action soon. In the meantime, Durham all-rounder Ben Stokes, who recently returned to competitive action after a knee injury, could potentially replace Anderson in the team.", "Julian Cuddihy, 43, was accused of murdering his parents, Kathleen and Jimmy, at their home in County Donegal back in 2014.

The moves, which take effect in mid-March, will benefit customers on standard domestic gas tariffs. The cuts come after a 57% drop in wholesale gas prices over the past year, prompting calls for suppliers to pass on savings to customers. While the reductions are welcome, critics argue that they don't go far enough, with some customers still able to save up to \u00a3300 by switching to fixed deals. Additionally, electricity tariffs remain unchanged despite falling wholesale costs, with suppliers citing increased environmental costs and network charges.

Machan and Wells put on an incredible show, racking up 134 runs for the second wicket before Machan's impressive 81 was finally brought to an end by Ravi Patel's clever bowling. Wells soon followed, but not before scoring a solid 61. Then, Yardy took center stage, smashing 70 runs at Lord's to help Sussex reach a respectable 300 all out, giving them a crucial 66-run lead. Middlesex fought back, with Sam Robson racing to 41 not out, but they still trail by 19 runs. The worn pitch made Machan's knock all the more remarkable, and Yardy and Wells' more measured approaches paid off. Patel's introduction to the attack was a game-changer, as he quickly dispatched Machan, Wells, Nash, and Brown. Just when it seemed like Middlesex were taking control, Sussex launched a stunning fightback, thanks to Ashar Zaidi's 38-run partnership with Yardy, followed by a vital 40 from Yardy and Ollie Robinson. James Harris eventually wrapped up the Sussex tail, but not before Yardy and Robinson had given their team a real chance.

Green Party candidate Samir Jeraj trailed behind with 13% of the vote. The election marked a significant shift in the borough's leadership, as Labour maintains its stronghold with a commanding 43-seat majority.

Despite Mr. Corbyn's claims of building a \"mass movement\" capable of winning a general election, Mr. Smith dismissed this as \"delusional\" and accused the current leader of abandoning his commitment to \"straight, honest politics\".\n\nWith Labour's poll ratings at an all-time low, Mr. Smith painted a dire picture of the party's future, warning that it could be left with as few as 140 MPs if it continued on its current \"disastrous trajectory\".

While the job market, housing, and consumer spending are all looking up, the bank is still playing it cool, refusing to give a clear timeline for when interest rates will rise.\n\nThe Fed's policymakers are optimistic that inflation will gradually creep up to its 2% target, and they're encouraged by the job market's solid gains, which have brought unemployment down to a seven-year low of 5.3%. But they're not ready to pull the trigger on a rate hike just yet, insisting that they need to see more improvement in the labor market and inflation before making a move.\n\nThe decision to keep interest rates at rock-bottom levels for now was widely expected, but analysts are still betting on a rate hike in September. \"The Fed is taking baby steps towards an increase,\" says Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds. And with the interest rate stuck at a record low for six and a half years, the anticipation is building.\n\nThe Fed's chair, Janet Yellen, has emphasized that any rate hike will be data-driven and gradual, and most analysts agree that September is the most likely time for the first increase.

Privacy International has been fighting against the practices of GCHQ, MI5, and MI6, and a recent ruling has confirmed that some of their data collection methods were unlawful.\n\nThe Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) found that the spy agencies' collection of communications data, including who, where, when, and with whom individuals communicated, violated the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). This data is crucial for identifying intelligence targets, but the ECHR states that all citizens have the right to a private life and that any interference with personal data must be lawful and necessary.\n\nThe ruling is a major embarrassment for the government, as it reveals that much of the data collection was carried out under an outdated law that failed to provide adequate safeguards. \"The laws that govern what the agencies can and can't do shouldn't be secret,\" said Graham Smith, a lawyer at Bird & Bird. \"Everyone accepts that operational secrets are necessary, but the laws themselves should be transparent.\"\n\nHowever, the IPT also acknowledged that the government has since taken steps to address these concerns. In February 2015, a new policy was introduced to ensure that data collection is carried out lawfully, and the intelligence agencies have since implemented these changes.\n\nWhile the government has welcomed the ruling, Privacy International has hailed it as a \"highly significant judgment\" that highlights the need for greater transparency and stronger safeguards. The Home Office has pledged to provide greater transparency and stronger safeguards for bulk data collection powers, but campaigners will be watching closely to ensure that these promises are kept.\n\nThis landmark ruling has significant implications for the balance between national security and individual privacy, and it's a major victory for those fighting to protect our human rights.", "A rocket attack on Turkish tanks in Syria has resulted in the deaths of five Turkish soldiers, the first fatalities since Turkey launched its operation in Syria two weeks ago.

Rodgers acknowledges that Dembele will eventually depart the club, but he expects the striker to make substantial contributions before that time arrives. \"I believe we are all aware that he will eventually move on; it is simply a matter of timing,\" Rodgers told BBC Sport. \"However, at present, he is extremely content here.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has launched an investigation into the circumstances surrounding Smith's death, focusing on the methods used to detain him and why he was kept in restraints at the police station. The investigation has implicated eight police officers and two staff members, with two sergeants (one of whom has since retired) and a contracted health worker facing potential charges of gross negligence manslaughter and misconduct in public office.

Retired Sheriff Peter Gillam, who served from 1991 to 2013, attributed these disparities to the independence of the judiciary. According to Gillam, while a sentencing advisory board exists, each judge brings their unique perspective and approach to decision-making. He emphasized that a degree of uniformity is maintained through the Appeal Court, which corrects any egregious sentencing decisions. However, Gillam believes that it would be misguided to impose strict uniformity on the judiciary, as local knowledge and individualized consideration are essential to fair sentencing. Ultimately, he advocates for trusting judges to make informed decisions based on their expertise and full understanding of each case.", "A 25-year-old cricketer tragically died from a brain hemorrhage two days after being struck on the neck during a match in Sydney on November 25, 2014. A five-day inquest was held to investigate whether his death could have been prevented. During the hearing, some players were accused of dishonesty for claiming they couldn't remember key events from that day. The inquest, which began on Monday at the New South Wales Coroner's Court, heard testimony from players including Brad Haddin, Doug Bollinger, and David Warner. The court examined whether the deceased, Phillip Hughes, was targeted with short-pitch bowling or received intimidating comments from opponents while batting for South Australia in a Sheffield Shield game against New South Wales. Questions were also raised about whether a bowler threatened Hughes before the fatal injury. Hughes' parents walked out of the inquest after the family's counsel, Greg Melick SC, criticized the players for repeatedly claiming they had \"no recollection\" or \"couldn't recall\" key events. Melick argued that there was a plan to target Hughes with short-pitched balls, which increased the risk of injury. The counsel representing Cricket Australia and its players denied allegations of fabricated evidence. The coroner, Michael Barnes, will deliver his findings on November 4. A previous report commissioned by Cricket Australia recommended making protective helmets compulsory for batsmen facing fast- and medium-paced bowling, but concluded that even the newest safety-standard helmets would not have saved Hughes' life.", "Following mediation efforts by the South Sudanese government, 19 individuals have been released from captivity. This marks the first group to be freed since the cross-border raid on April 15, in which approximately 125 children were abducted. The attack was perpetrated by members of the Murle community, who have been previously accused of stealing livestock and children to raise as their own.\n\nThe raid, which resulted in the deaths of over 200 individuals from the rival Nuer community in Ethiopia's western Gambella province, prompted Ethiopian forces to cross into South Sudan and encircle the villages where the children were being held. However, through diplomatic negotiations between South Sudanese officials and the abductors, the children were freed without incident, according to the Ethiopian News Agency.\n\nNegotiations are set to continue in an effort to secure the release of all remaining children. As stated by South Sudan's Ambassador to Ethiopia, James Pitia Morgan, \"It is imperative that the children are rescued and reunited with their families, and that the stolen cattle are returned to their rightful owners.\"\n\nThe long-standing border between Ethiopia and South Sudan has historically been prone to cross-border raids involving the Murle and Nuer communities. However, the scale of the April 15 attack has sparked widespread shock and outrage in both countries, leading to protests in Ethiopia's Gambella region, where parents are demanding greater protection for their children. In response, Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn has condemned the raid, attributing it to \"primitive and destructive forces.\"", "Priyanka Yoshikawa, a 22-year-old elephant trainer and newly crowned Miss Japan, has vowed to challenge prevailing attitudes with her historic win.

But that doesn't diminish my Japanese identity.\" She credited Miyamoto with paving the way for mixed-race women like herself, saying, \"Before Ariana, haafu girls couldn't represent Japan. She showed us that it's possible.\"\n\nYoshikawa's own experiences with prejudice have made her a strong advocate for greater acceptance. \"When I returned to Japan, people treated me like an outcast,\" she recalled. \"But that only made me stronger.\" Her win has drawn criticism from some quarters, with some arguing that her Indian heritage makes her less Japanese. However, many have rallied around her, including Indians who have taken to social media to urge the Japanese to be more open-minded.\n\nThe backlash against Yoshikawa echoes the abuse faced by Nina Davuluri, an Indian-American who was crowned Miss America in 2014. Davuluri was subjected to racist and xenophobic attacks on Twitter, prompting widespread outrage and support from the Indian community.\n\nIn both cases, the criticism seems to center on the notion of \"purity\" \u2013 the idea that a person's identity must conform to certain racial or ethnic standards. However, as one Twitter user astutely observed, \"Talent cannot be controlled or ruled by caste, color, gender, or country of origin.\"\n\nYoshikawa, an avid kick-boxer and qualified elephant trainer, hopes to use her platform to challenge these outdated attitudes. \"When I'm abroad, people never ask me about my mixed heritage,\" she said. \"As Miss Japan, I hope to change perceptions so that it's the same here too.\" Despite the criticism, Yoshikawa remains undeterred, saying, \"I've lived in Japan for so long now, I feel Japanese.

This comes after Shadow Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens resigned last week over the issue, and other senior MPs have threatened to rebel. Corbyn has instructed all Labour MPs to support the bill, despite the party's initial campaign to remain in the EU and many Labour MPs representing constituencies that voted to remain. However, many Labour MPs also represent areas that voted to leave the EU. Corbyn acknowledges the pressure on MPs in pro-Remain constituencies but urges them to unite on key issues. Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott argues that it would be undemocratic for MPs to vote against the bill, given the UK-wide referendum result. Several Labour MPs, including Tulip Siddiq and Daniel Zeichner, have announced their intention to vote against the bill, while Labour whips Jeff Smith and Thangam Debbonaire have also said they will rebel. Corbyn emphasized that it is impossible to remain in the shadow cabinet if one votes against the party's decision.

So far this season, Sturridge has made six appearances, scoring four goals. In the 2013-14 season, he netted 28 times for Liverpool and England, but was limited to just 18 appearances last season due to thigh, calf, and hip injuries. After undergoing hip surgery in May, Sturridge played in three games at the start of this term, but then didn't feature again until 29 November. He scored twice in the 6-1 League Cup quarter-final win over Southampton last Wednesday, but was injured at Newcastle after coming on in the 62nd minute. When a foot problem forced him to miss the Reds' Europa League win over Bordeaux on 26 November, Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp stated that Sturridge needed to learn \"what is serious pain and what is only pain\". With seven games on the horizon until the first leg of their League Cup semi-final at Stoke on 5 January, Liverpool, currently eighth in the Premier League, will be hoping for a swift recovery from their injured striker.", "You might remember the horrific case of a 14-year-old girl who was gang-raped and murdered in Indonesia. It was a wake-up call for the country, and President Joko Widodo proposed some big changes to the laws in May. The idea was to get tougher on sex offenders, but it sparked a heated debate in parliament. Two opposition parties voted against one of the most controversial proposals: chemical castration.\n\nHuman rights groups were quick to speak out against the punishments, saying that violence won't solve the problem of violence. The Indonesian Doctors Association also weighed in, saying that administering chemical castration would go against their professional ethics. The procedure involves injecting convicts with female hormones, and it's already used in some countries like Poland, South Korea, and Russia.\n\nBut that's not all - the new laws also give judges the option to sentence paedophiles to death or tag them electronically, and they introduce a minimum 10-year sentence for child sex crimes. Not everyone is on board, though. Human rights groups like the National Commission for Women (NCW) are calling for the laws to be reviewed every year to see if they're actually making a difference. Azriana, the head of the NCW, points out that other countries that have tried chemical castration haven't seen a drop in sexual crimes against kids. Plus, it's a pricey procedure - wouldn't it be better to invest in services that support victims?\n\nOn the other hand, Dr Yohana Susana Yembise, Indonesia's Minister for Women Empowerment and Child Protection, is hoping that the harsh punishments will have the desired effect. She says, \"We've got the toughest punishments on the books now: the death penalty, life in prison, chemical castration, public shaming, and electronic tagging. Love it or hate it, everyone needs to get on board.\"\n\nThese changes come after a string of high-profile child sexual abuse cases in Indonesia. Last year, a British-Canadian teacher and an Indonesian were jailed for 10 years for abusing kids at a Jakarta kindergarten. And just a few months ago, a nine-year-old girl was found murdered in a cardboard box in Jakarta after being repeatedly sexually assaulted. It's clear that something needs to be done to tackle this problem, but the question is: will these new laws really make a difference?", "A 17-year-old from the Netherlands or Belgium died in a bungee jumping accident in Spain. The teenager was staying at a surf camp and was participating in a type of bungee jump called \"puenting\" from a bridge in Cantabria, northern Spain. Unfortunately, the teenager fell 130 feet into a dry riverbed below and died.\n\nThis is the second bungee jumping death in Spain this summer. Last month, a British tourist died after hitting a bridge wall during a bungee jump in southern Spain.\n\nThe police are investigating the latest accident and think it might have been caused by carelessness, but they're not sure what went wrong. The type of bungee jump the teenager was doing, \"puenting\", involves diving with two cords attached and then swinging under the bridge.\n\nBungee jumping has become very popular in Spain, especially in rural areas with beautiful scenery. However, it can be dangerous, and there have been around 10 deaths related to bungee jumping in Spain since the 1980s.\n\nThe local police chief said he didn't know that \"puenting\" was happening on the bridge and thinks it's extremely risky. The mayor of the area expressed her condolences to the teenager's family and offered to help them in any way she can.", "Archaeologists employed by the National Trust for Scotland (NTS) have made a significant discovery at Culzean Castle in South Ayrshire, uncovering a previously unknown walled enclosure beneath the lawn in the Fountain Court. According to NTS, this enclosure likely served as a kitchen garden from approximately 1733 to 1782. Consistent with the architectural trends of the late 18th century, a new walled garden was subsequently constructed out of sight from the castle, allowing the original site to be landscaped to enhance the views from the property.\n\nDerek Alexander, Head of Archaeological Services for NTS, commented, \"Despite being marked on the estate map, we were unaware that any remnants of the original structure had survived beneath the immaculately manicured lawn of the Fountain Court. This project has provided a unique opportunity to explore a previously hidden aspect of Culzean's history. Once the lawn is re-seeded, I suspect the gardeners will be reluctant to permit further excavations!\"\n\nHistorical records suggest that the garden was established as part of a broader renovation project undertaken by Sir John Kennedy of Culzean, 2nd Baronet, in 1733. The garden is depicted on an estate map of Culzean created by John Foulis in 1755. The site was eventually abandoned in 1782, and the walls were demolished by Robert Adam's workmen as part of a comprehensive series of improvements to the castle. The ongoing drainage works at Fountain Court aim to render the area suitable for hosting large-scale public events.", "Get ready to celebrate a major milestone! In March, we reached an incredible landmark - nine whole months ahead of schedule! This achievement is the culmination of decades of tireless global efforts and investment to bring life-saving antiretroviral drugs to those who need them most, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nSince the UN set its sights on combating HIV in 2000, the progress has been nothing short of remarkable. Back then, fewer than 700,000 people had access to these vital medicines. Fast forward to today, and we've made huge strides! According to UN Aids' latest report, our collective efforts have prevented a staggering 30 million new HIV infections and nearly 8 million Aids-related deaths since the millennium. That's right, folks - we've saved millions of lives!\n\nThe numbers are astounding: new HIV infections have plummeted from 2.6 million per year to 1.8 million, and Aids-related deaths have dropped from 1.6 million to 1.2 million. And the best part? Global investment in HIV has skyrocketed from \u00a33.1bn ($4.8bn) in 2000 to a whopping \u00a313bn ($20bn) in 2014!\n\nBut here's the most exciting part: if we keep up the momentum and work together over the next five years, we can actually end the Aids epidemic by 2030! That's right, we can make HIV a thing of the past.\n\nOf course, there's still work to be done. We need to bridge the gap in awareness of HIV status, which remains the biggest barrier to treatment access. And we must continue to improve treatment access for children, who have historically lagged behind adults in receiving antiretroviral therapy.\n\nBut despite these challenges, the progress we've made is undeniable. And with the switch to the Sustainable Development Goals, we have a unique opportunity to finish what we started. As Ban Ki-moon, Secretary General of the United Nations, so aptly put it: \"The world has delivered on halting and reversing the Aids epidemic. Now we must commit to ending the Aids epidemic as part of the Sustainable Development Goals.\"\n\nSo let's keep pushing forward, shall we? The next five years will be critical, and with front-loaded investment, we can \"sprint\" towards our goal of ending the Aids epidemic by 2030. The finish line is in sight - let's make it happen!", "Meet James, a 23-year-old from Colwyn Bay who's defying all odds and living life to the fullest! Born with diastrophic dysplasia, also known as dwarfism, James has faced numerous challenges, including two major operations by the time he was just seven years old. But despite these obstacles, he's never let his condition hold him back.\n\nToday, James is an inspiration to many, and his remarkable story is about to take a thrilling turn. He's been selected to carry the Olympic torch in Rhos-on-Sea, Wales, from May 25-30! This incredible honor is a testament to James' unwavering spirit and his tireless efforts to promote disability sport.\n\nJames' journey to this moment began when he met his friend Russell Swannack at the Beijing Paralympics in 2008. Russell was so inspired by James' enthusiasm and dedication that he nominated him to carry the torch. \"James is a true champion, both on and off the field,\" Russell said. \"He's worked tirelessly to empower others with disabilities to get involved in sports, and I'm thrilled to see him receive this well-deserved recognition.\"\n\nAs a member of the Dwarf Sports Association, James has racked up an impressive list of achievements, including three junior sports personality awards and a nine-year reign as the British Class 1 badminton champion. But more than his impressive resume, it's James' infectious positivity and zest for life that's inspiring countless others.\n\n\"I've always believed that God made me the way I am for a reason,\" James said. \"I've learned to accept and love myself, and I want to help others do the same. Carrying the Olympic torch is a dream come true, and I'm honored to be a part of this incredible experience.\"", "According to official figures, sales values in Scotland increased by 0.1% between January and March, compared to a 0.3% rise in the UK. Sales volumes also saw a 0.7% increase, slightly lower than the UK's 0.8%. Over the past year, sales volumes in Scotland rose by 2.7%, while values only increased by 0.1%. David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail Consortium, welcomed the return to growth but noted that consumer confidence remains fragile, affecting retailers. He urged the next Scottish government to prioritize policies that promote investment and expansion in the sector. Lonsdale emphasized that the retail industry's prospects depend on the economy and their ability to adapt, and that the new government can help by supporting the industry, Scotland's largest private-sector employer. Euan Murray of Barclays Corporate Banking in Scotland attributed the modest 0.7% increase in sales volume to food sales, and noted that non-food retailers are benefiting from strong online offerings, which are becoming increasingly important. Recent industry figures showed a mixed performance in March, with total sales down 1.3% compared to the same period last year. While household goods did well, fashion and footwear saw their worst decline since May last year, partly due to the early Easter.", "His younger sibling Ogbonna informed BBC Sport that the ex-Arsenal goal-scorer is recovering nicely after the procedure. \"It's crucial to emphasize that the choice to perform surgery was made during his routine health examination. \"We express gratitude to the Almighty that everything went smoothly and he's in excellent health. The choice to operate was made during his routine health examination \"The family would like to extend a heartfelt 'thank you' to Nigerians and Nwankwo Kanu's admirers globally for their blessings and kind sentiments.\" The former Nigeria team leader initially underwent cardiac surgery in November 1996 to correct a defective aortic valve. After a year-long hiatus, he resumed playing for Inter Milan and in February 1999 joined Premier League team Arsenal. This experience inspired him to establish a foundation to construct five medical facilities in Africa to diagnose and treat undetected heart conditions and provide surgical interventions. Over the weekend, the Nigerian government recognized Kanu among the 100 most illustrious Nigerians during a ceremony to commemorate the centenary of the unification of north and south Nigeria. Kanu declared his retirement from international football at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. His international achievements include a Fifa under-17 World Cup title in 1993 and the 1996 Olympic football gold medal. Kanu's individual accolades include African Footballer of the Year awards in 1996 and 1999.", "The march kicked off at 2:15 pm in St Helen's Square and made its way to York Minster.

Harkirit Boparai, the organizer from York Human Rights Network, summed it up perfectly: \"Today's demo showed us the true spirit of York - we're a community that cares!\" This comes on the heels of David Cameron's announcement that the UK will take in up to 20,000 people from Syrian refugee camps, with a focus on helping vulnerable kids. Now, the City of York Council is teaming up with local partners to figure out how we can best support these new arrivals, as we wait to hear more from the government about the resettlement process.", "In a comprehensive effort to gather critical data, researchers will engage with skippers and vessel owners from all segments of Northern Ireland's fishing industry over the next four days to scrutinize their operational expenditures. This initiative is a crucial component of the 11th annual economic survey of the UK fishing fleet, a seminal study that provides invaluable insights into the industry's economic landscape. The findings will be published in a forthcoming report next year. \n\nTom Pickerell, a leading expert from Seafish, emphasized the significance of this endeavor, stating: \"This rigorous exercise is essential for gaining a profound understanding of the industry's complexities and informing key stakeholders at both national and European levels. We strongly encourage skippers and boat owners across the UK to participate in this project by sharing their expertise with our researchers, thereby ensuring the most accurate and comprehensive picture possible.

The family was on holiday together when the accident occurred. According to his family, Carwyn was an experienced skier and snowboarder who had been skiing since he was three years old.\n\nThe family explained that they were skiing together on their last run of the day when Carwyn's sister lost her ski on a jump. Carwyn skied ahead, and that's when the accident happened. The family is still trying to come to terms with the devastating loss, saying they're left with a \"vast void in their hearts.\"\n\nThe police believe that Carwyn got separated from his parents and skied in the wrong direction, eventually stopping at the top of a cliff, removing his skis, and then falling. The family, who run an award-winning produce business and rent holiday cottages on their farm in Talybont-on-Usk, Wales, are receiving an outpouring of support from their community.\n\nLiam Fitzpatrick, a local councillor, said the village is \"in absolute shock\" over the tragedy. \"It's impossible to comprehend what they're going through right now,\" he said. \"The community will be ready to assist in any way it can when they return.\"", "Transfer updates from May to August can be found on their respective pages, while our dedicated page provides a comprehensive list of players released by each club.

According to the council, these changes will enable schools to operate more effectively and efficiently. The report highlights that secondary school pupil numbers in the town have significantly decreased over the past 20 years, while primary schools have the capacity to accommodate an additional 1,400 students.\n\nAs part of the Learning Town scheme, all four secondary schools in Dumfries are being rebuilt or refurbished. A new \"learning hub\" with space for over 300 students is also under construction. To address the decline in secondary school enrollment, the report proposes capping the S1 intake for Dumfries Academy and Dumfries High School at below-average numbers for the past 20 years, starting from next year.
