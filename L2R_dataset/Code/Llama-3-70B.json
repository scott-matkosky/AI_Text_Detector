Your mission is to uncover the deepest level of nesting within each group.\n\nFor instance, the enigmatic string `(()())` conceals a maximum of two levels of nesting, while `((()))` reveals a more intricate structure with three levels. Your challenge is to write a function that can unravel the mystery of these nested parentheses.\n\n**The Solution**\n\nTo crack the code, we'll employ a clever strategy. First, we'll define a helper function `parse_paren_group` that takes a single group of parentheses as input. This function will meticulously track the depth of nesting by incrementing a counter whenever it encounters an opening parenthesis `(` and decrementing it when it meets a closing parenthesis `)`. The maximum depth encountered during this process will be our culprit \u2013 the deepest level of nesting.\n\nNow, let's put it all together. We'll split the input string into individual groups, apply our `parse_paren_group` function to each, and collect the results in a list. The final solution will be a list of integers, each representing the maximum depth of nesting for its corresponding group.\n\nHere's the Python code that brings it all to life:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:\n    def parse_paren_group(s):\n        depth = 0\n        max_depth = 0\n        for c in s:\n            if c == '(':\n                depth += 1\n                max_depth = max(depth, max_depth)\n            else:\n                depth -= 1\n\n        return max_depth\n\n    return [parse_paren_group(x) for x in paren_string.split(' ') if x]\n```\nWith this function, we can now tackle even the most perplexing nested parentheses. For example, the input `'(()()) ((())) () ((())()())'` yields the output `[2, 3, 1, 3]`, revealing the deepest level of nesting for each group.", "```\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Filter an input list of strings only for ones that contain a given substring.\n\n    Examples:\n        >>> filter_by_substring([], 'a')\n        []\n        >>> filter_by_substring(['abc', 'bacd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')\n        ['abc', 'bacd', 'array']\n    \"\"\"\n    return [x for x in strings if substring in x]\n```", "```\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\n\ndef sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:\n    \"\"\"Compute the sum and product of a list of integers.\n\n    For an empty list, the sum is 0 and the product is 1.\n\n    Examples:\n        >>> sum_product([])\n        (0, 1)\n        >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])\n        (10, 24)\n    \"\"\"\n    sum_value = 0\n    prod_value = 1\n\n    for n in numbers:\n        sum_value += n\n        prod_value *= n\n    return sum_value, prod_value\n```", "**Get the Rolling Maximum of a List of Numbers**\n\nDo you have a list of numbers and want to find the highest value at each point in the sequence?

Its primary objective is to scrutinize the list and determine whether it contains three distinct elements that, when added together, result in a sum of zero. If such a combination exists, the function returns True, indicating a positive outcome. Conversely, if no such triplet is found, the function returns False, signifying a negative result.\n\nThe provided unit tests exemplify the expected behavior of the triples_sum_to_zero function. For instance, the list [1, 3, 5, 0] does not contain three distinct elements that sum to zero, hence the function correctly returns False. On the other hand, the list [1, 3, -2, 1] does contain such a triplet, namely 1, 3, and -2, which sum to zero, resulting in the function returning True.\n\nThe implementation of the triples_sum_to_zero function employs a nested loop approach to systematically examine all possible triplets within the input list. It iterates through the list, considering each element as a potential component of a triplet, and then explores all possible combinations of two additional elements that, together with the initial element, might sum to zero. If a triplet satisfying this condition is discovered, the function immediately returns True. If, after exhaustively searching the list, no such triplet is found, the function returns False, indicating that the list does not contain three distinct elements that sum to zero.", "def car_race_collision(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    Get ready for the ultimate high-speed showdown!

The conjecture states that this sequence will always reach 1, regardless of the starting value.\n\nKey notes:\n\n* The sequence for 1 is simply [1].\n* The returned list is sorted in ascending order.\n\nFor instance, get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5], as the Collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], and the odd numbers in this sequence are 1 and 5.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n```\ndef get_odd_collatz(n):\n    if n%2==0:\n        odd_collatz = [] \n    else:\n        odd_collatz = [n]\n    while n > 1:\n        if n % 2 == 0:\n            n = n/2\n        else:\n            n = n*3 + 1\n            \n        if n%2 == 1:\n            odd_collatz.append(int(n))\n\n    return sorted(odd_collatz)\n```", "**Valid Date Function**\n\nThe `valid_date` function takes a date string as input and returns `True` if the date is valid, and `False` otherwise. A date is considered valid if it meets the following conditions:\n\n1. **Non-empty string**: The date string cannot be empty.\n2. **Correct day range**: The number of days must be between 1 and 31 for months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12. For months 4, 6, 9, and 11, the day range is 1-30. For month 2, the day range is 1-29.\n3. **Valid month**: The month must be between 1 and 12.\n4. **Correct format**: The date string must be in the format `mm-dd-yyyy`.\n\n**Examples**\n\n* `valid_date('03-11-2000')` returns `True`\n* `valid_date('15-01-2012')` returns `False` (invalid month)\n* `valid_date('04-0-2040')` returns `False` (invalid day)\n* `valid_date('06-04-2020')` returns `True`\n* `valid_date('06/04/2020')` returns `False` (invalid format)\n\nThe implementation of the `valid_date` function is as follows:\n```\ndef valid_date(date):\n    try:\n        date = date.strip()\n        month, day, year = date.split('-')\n        month, day, year = int(month), int(day), int(year)\n        if month < 1 or month > 12:\n            return False\n        if month in [1,3,5,7,8,10,12] and day < 1 or day > 31:\n            return False\n        if month in [4,6,9,11] and day < 1 or day > 30:\n            return False\n        if month == 2 and day < 1 or day > 29:\n            return False\n    except:\n        return False\n\n    return True\n```", "Take a string of words and break it down into a list of individual words.
