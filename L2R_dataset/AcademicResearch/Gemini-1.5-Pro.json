Ristretto goes beyond simply converting models to fixed-point; it employs a sophisticated analysis to determine the optimal bit-width for each layer while adhering to a user-defined accuracy threshold.  \n\nMoreover, Ristretto incorporates a fine-tuning step to further optimize the condensed fixed-point network, ensuring minimal performance degradation.  Our experiments demonstrate Ristretto's efficacy in reducing the computational demands of popular CNN models like CaffeNet and SqueezeNet.  Remarkably, Ristretto can successfully condense these networks to use only 8-bit fixed-point representations with a minimal accuracy loss of less than 1%.  \n\nTo foster wider adoption and further research in this domain, we have made the source code for Ristretto publicly available.

This paper argues that for a desired accuracy level, prioritizing DNN architectures with reduced parameter counts offers significant advantages across multiple domains:\n\n1. **Distributed Training Efficiency:** Smaller DNNs inherently require less inter-server communication during distributed training, leading to faster convergence and reduced communication overhead.\n\n2. **Model Deployment Bandwidth:**  Exporting compact DNN models from centralized cloud environments to edge devices, such as autonomous vehicles, necessitates significantly less bandwidth, facilitating rapid deployment and updates. \n\n3. **Hardware Resource Utilization:**  Memory-constrained hardware platforms, such as FPGAs, benefit immensely from smaller DNNs, enabling efficient on-device inference and broader applicability.\n\nTo concretize these advantages, we introduce SqueezeNet, a novel DNN architecture meticulously designed for parsimony.  SqueezeNet attains accuracy comparable to AlexNet on the ImageNet benchmark while utilizing a staggering 50x fewer parameters.  Furthermore, through the application of model compression techniques, SqueezeNet can be compressed to an astoundingly small footprint of less than 0.5MB, representing a 510x reduction compared to AlexNet. \n\nThe availability of the SqueezeNet architecture at [https://github.com/DeepScale/SqueezeNet](https://github.com/DeepScale/SqueezeNet) facilitates further research and practical applications of this efficient architecture. \n", "Reasoning over multiple pieces of information to answer a question is a hallmark of human intelligence.

This function is trained to associate low energy values with regions proximate to the data manifold, while assigning progressively higher energies to regions farther from this manifold.\n\nWithin the EBGAN framework, the generator's objective remains akin to that of probabilistic GANs: to produce contrastive samples that minimize the discriminator's assigned energy.  However, conceptualizing the discriminator as an energy function unlocks a wider spectrum of architectural and loss function possibilities beyond the traditional binary classifier with a logistic output. \n\nTo illustrate the versatility of EBGAN, we present a compelling instantiation that employs an auto-encoder architecture as the discriminator. In this configuration, the reconstruction error serves as a proxy for the energy function. Our empirical evaluations reveal that this particular form of EBGAN exhibits enhanced training stability compared to conventional GANs. \n\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that a single-scale EBGAN architecture can be successfully trained to generate high-resolution images, highlighting the potential of this framework for complex generative tasks. \n\nThank you. \n", "The world of deep learning is abuzz with innovation, a whirlwind of new architectures emerging at a dizzying pace.

These are inputs that have been subtly altered in a way that's imperceptible to humans but causes the model to make incorrect predictions. This vulnerability poses a major obstacle for deploying deep learning in safety-critical applications, where reliability is paramount.\n\nMany techniques have been proposed to defend against adversarial attacks, but most have been quickly circumvented by new attack strategies.  This constant cat-and-mouse game highlights the need for more robust and reliable defense mechanisms.\n\nWe propose a solution based on formal verification, a rigorous mathematical approach to proving the correctness of systems. Our method allows us to construct adversarial examples that are guaranteed to be minimally distorted \u2013 meaning they represent the smallest possible change to the original input that still causes the model to fail.\n\nUsing this powerful tool, we can rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of different defenses.  We demonstrate that \"adversarial retraining,\" a popular defense strategy, provably increases the difficulty of constructing adversarial examples by a factor of 4.2.  This provides strong evidence that adversarial retraining truly enhances model robustness, unlike many other defenses that have proven to be superficial.\n\nOur work represents a significant step towards building reliable and trustworthy deep learning systems by leveraging the power of formal verification to analyze and strengthen their resistance to adversarial attacks. \n\n\n", "The limitations of traditional Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with fixed-dimensional Gaussian latent spaces are increasingly evident.  We argue that allowing for a latent space with flexible dimensionality can significantly enhance the expressiveness and representation learning capabilities of VAEs.\n\nThis paper introduces the Stick-Breaking Variational Autoencoder (SB-VAE), a novel generative model that overcomes this limitation.  By extending Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes to handle the weights of Stick-Breaking processes, we enable the SB-VAE to learn latent representations with *stochastic dimensionality*. This nonparametric approach empowers the model to adapt the complexity of its latent space to the intricacies of the data, leading to more powerful and disentangled representations.\n\nOur empirical results unequivocally demonstrate the advantages of the SB-VAE.  Both the unsupervised and semi-supervised variants consistently outperform standard Gaussian VAEs, achieving superior performance on a variety of tasks. This underscores the crucial role of flexible latent dimensionality in unlocking the full potential of variational autoencoders for representation learning and generative modeling. \n", "Imagine training a bunch of neural networks at the same time, but instead of them working in isolation, they can actually learn from each other!

In our framework, the different neural networks can automatically figure out which parts of their \"brains\" (parameters) are useful for other tasks and reuse them!\n\nWhat's cool about our approach is that we don't tell the networks in advance how to share their knowledge.  Instead, they learn the best sharing strategy directly from the data itself. This means they can be super flexible and adapt to whatever tasks they're given.  It's like having a team of AI experts who can figure out the best way to collaborate on their own! \n", "Building agents that can learn to navigate complex environments through trial and error is a central challenge in reinforcement learning.

This vulnerability poses a serious threat to the reliability of these models.\n\nWe address this challenge by introducing three methods for detecting adversarial images.  Our detectors force attackers to make a trade-off: either create less effective adversarial examples that are harder to detect or generate more easily detectable examples that are less likely to fool the original classifier. \n\nOur most effective detection method leverages a key insight: adversarial examples tend to rely heavily on lower-ranked principal components, creating an abnormal pattern that our detector can identify. \n\nWe provide further analysis, including additional detectors and a visually informative saliency map, in the appendix.

While \u03b2-VAEs generalize VAEs beyond probabilistic generative modeling by enabling explicit control over this trade-off, their application to hierarchical models reveals further nuances.\n\nWe identify a general class of hierarchical VAE inference models for which the overall information content (\"rate\") can be decomposed into contributions from individual latent layers. This decomposition allows for independent control over the rate at each layer, facilitating more targeted optimization for specific downstream tasks. \n\nWe derive theoretical bounds on downstream task performance as a function of the individual layer rates, establishing a formal relationship between latent representation complexity and task-specific success.  Extensive empirical evaluations validate our theoretical findings, demonstrating the practical implications of this layer-wise rate control. \n\nOur results provide valuable guidance for practitioners seeking to optimize hierarchical VAEs for specific applications.

You've got all these people connected in different ways, and sometimes you want to figure out who's similar to whom, or predict who might become friends in the future.  That's where node embeddings come in \u2013 they're like creating a secret code for each person that captures their connections and characteristics.\n\nOur method, Graph2Gauss, is a super smart way to learn these embeddings, even for massive networks.  But here's the twist: instead of just assigning a single code to each person, we represent them as a fuzzy cloud of possibilities, like acknowledging that we can't know everything about someone with absolute certainty.  \n\nThis \"Gaussian distribution\" embedding lets us capture uncertainty and reveals interesting things about the network.  For example, we can figure out how diverse someone's friend group is or discover hidden communities within the network. \n\nGraph2Gauss is also a master of adaptation.  It can handle different types of networks, with or without extra information about each person (like their interests or age).  And here's the best part: it can even figure out the code for brand new people who join the network, without needing to re-learn everything from scratch!\n\nWe put Graph2Gauss to the test on real-world networks and it crushed it!  It outperformed other methods in predicting links, classifying nodes, and even uncovering hidden network structures.

It stores a vast collection of past experiences \u2013 represented by hidden activations \u2013 in a readily accessible memory bank.  When faced with a new word, the model cleverly retrieves relevant memories through a simple dot product operation, seamlessly weaving past context into its predictions.\n\nThis mechanism, both elegant and scalable, enables the model to effortlessly handle vast memory sizes, ensuring that even distant past experiences can contribute to its understanding of the present. We draw a compelling parallel between this external memory mechanism and the cache models employed in traditional count-based language models, highlighting the underlying connections between these seemingly disparate approaches.\n\nOur experiments on various language modeling benchmarks reveal a resounding success.

This work investigates the spectral properties of the Hessian matrix, which captures the curvature of the loss function, providing insights into the model's behavior around local optima.\n\nWe analyze the eigenvalue distribution of the Hessian both before and after training, observing a consistent pattern: a dense concentration of eigenvalues forming a \"bulk\" around zero and a sparser set of \"edge\" eigenvalues located further away from zero. \n\nOur empirical evidence suggests that the bulk eigenvalues reflect the degree of over-parameterization in the network.  A wider bulk, with more eigenvalues clustered near zero, indicates a higher degree of redundancy in the model's parameters. \n\nConversely, the edge eigenvalues, which are more dispersed and influenced by the training data, capture information specific to the learning task. These eigenvalues reflect the curvature along directions that are relevant for separating different classes or fitting the target function. \n\nBy decoupling the effects of over-parameterization and data-dependent learning through the analysis of the Hessian's eigenvalue spectrum, we gain a deeper understanding of how neural networks learn and generalize.

You pay attention to the important parts, like the subject, verb, and object, and how they relate to each other.  \n\nThat's what attention networks do in deep learning \u2013 they help models focus on the most relevant parts of the input data. But sometimes, we need to understand more complex relationships, like the grammatical structure of a sentence or the connections between objects in an image.  \n\nWe explored a cool new way to incorporate this \"structural\" knowledge into attention networks.

We propose an ensemble of \"specialist\" models, each trained to excel in distinguishing between specific classes.  \n\nOur key insight is that adversarial examples tend to exploit predictable patterns of confusion.  By analyzing the confusion matrix, we can identify these weaknesses and create specialized models to address them. \n\nWhen these specialists work together, they can effectively identify and flag suspicious inputs.  If the experts disagree \u2013 resulting in high entropy or uncertainty \u2013 it's a strong signal that the input might be an adversarial example, and we can choose to reject it rather than risk a misclassification.\n\nOur experimental results confirm the power of this \"wisdom of the crowds\" approach.  Instead of trying to correctly classify every single input, which can be a losing battle against crafty adversaries, our ensemble focuses on identifying and rejecting the most suspicious cases.  This strategy significantly enhances the robustness of our system, providing a more secure and reliable defense against adversarial attacks. \n", "This paper introduces Neural Phrase-based Machine Translation (NPMT), a novel approach that leverages Sleep-WAke Networks (SWAN) to explicitly model phrase structures in the target language.  To address the monotonic alignment limitations of SWAN, NPMT incorporates a layer for soft local reordering of the input sequence.\n\nUnlike prevalent attention-based neural machine translation (NMT) models, NPMT generates translations by directly outputting phrases in sequential order, enabling linear-time decoding.

Bob's challenge is to either undo these actions (in reversible environments) or repeat them (in resettable environments).  This simple yet elegant framework, driven by a carefully crafted reward structure, creates an automatic curriculum of exploration, enabling the agents to learn valuable skills without any external supervision.\n\nThe benefits of this unsupervised training are undeniable. When Bob is subsequently tasked with solving a traditional reinforcement learning problem within the same environment, he exhibits a remarkable advantage.  Not only does he require significantly fewer supervised training episodes to achieve competence, but in some cases, he even surpasses the performance of agents trained solely with supervision.\n\nOur work demonstrates the power of self-play and intrinsic motivation in unlocking unsupervised skill learning, paving the way for more efficient and adaptable reinforcement learning agents capable of tackling complex tasks with minimal external guidance. \n\n\n", "Maximum entropy modeling, a powerful framework for building statistical models from limited information, has traditionally relied on optimizing directly over complex probability distributions. This paper introduces a novel and elegant alternative: learning a smooth and invertible transformation that maps a simple, known distribution to the desired maximum entropy distribution. \n\nImagine sculpting a complex shape from a block of clay. Instead of painstakingly molding the clay directly, we learn a series of smooth deformations that transform a simple sphere into the desired intricate form.\n\nThis approach, however, presents a unique challenge: the objective function, entropy, depends on the density itself, making optimization non-trivial. We overcome this hurdle by leveraging the expressive power of normalizing flow networks, a class of models that learn invertible transformations. \n\nThis transformation allows us to recast the maximum entropy problem into a finite-dimensional constrained optimization problem, making it amenable to efficient solutions. We employ a combination of stochastic optimization and the augmented Lagrangian method to navigate this constrained space and arrive at the optimal transformation.\n\nOur approach is not just theoretically appealing; it also delivers impressive results.  Simulations showcase the effectiveness of our method, while applications in finance and computer vision demonstrate its versatility and accuracy.  From modeling financial time series to capturing the intricate patterns in images, maximum entropy flow networks emerge as a powerful and flexible tool for statistical modeling. \n\n\n", "Okay, so AI is killing it these days, tackling all sorts of tough problems.

However, a comprehensive understanding of their success remains elusive. This paper presents a novel explanation for the benefits of skip connections, focusing on their ability to mitigate singularities in the loss landscape that hinder deep network training.\n\nOur analysis identifies three primary types of singularities:\n\n1. **Overlap Singularities:**  Arise from the permutation symmetry of nodes within a layer, where different permutations of nodes result in the same function, creating a degenerate manifold in the loss landscape.\n\n2. **Elimination Singularities:**  Occur when nodes are consistently deactivated, essentially eliminating them from the network and leading to a loss of representational capacity.\n\n3. **Linear Dependence Singularities:**  Arise from linear dependencies between nodes, reducing the effective dimensionality of the learned representation.\n\nThese singularities create challenging regions in the loss landscape, characterized by flat or poorly conditioned areas that impede gradient-based optimization algorithms. \n\nWe argue that skip connections effectively address these singularities through multiple mechanisms:\n\n* **Symmetry Breaking:** Skip connections break the permutation symmetry of nodes, reducing the prevalence of overlap singularities.\n\n* **Node Elimination Prevention:** By providing alternative pathways for information flow, skip connections reduce the likelihood of node elimination, mitigating elimination singularities.\n\n* **Reduced Linear Dependence:** Skip connections encourage diversity in node activations, reducing linear dependence and alleviating associated singularities.\n\nFurthermore, for common initialization schemes, skip connections shift the network away from the regions most affected by these singularities.

Adversarial examples, those cunningly crafted inputs designed to deceive, lurk in the shadows, threatening to unravel the very fabric of artificial intelligence.\n\nUnderstanding these adversarial subspaces, the treacherous regions where models falter, is crucial for building robust and reliable AI systems.  Enter Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID), a promising tool for illuminating these shadowy corners.  \n\nBut is LID truly the silver bullet we've been searching for?  \n\nOur investigation unveils a darker truth.  We subject LID to a series of rigorous tests, probing its limits in the face of two formidable challenges:\n\n1. **Oblivious Attacks:**  When confronted with attacks that operate without knowledge of the target model, LID's effectiveness crumbles.  Even more alarming, its performance proves highly sensitive to the attacker's confidence level.  Ensembles of adversarial examples with varying confidence levels, a seemingly robust strategy, surprisingly cripple LID's ability to discern the adversarial subspace.\n\n2. **Black-box Transfer Attacks:**  When adversarial examples are crafted from a different model, LID's defenses are rendered utterly ineffective.

We expose a phenomenon called \"obfuscated gradients\" \u2013 a form of gradient masking that tricks attackers into believing a defense is effective when it's not. \n\nWhile defenses exhibiting obfuscated gradients appear to thwart iterative optimization-based attacks, we demonstrate that they are ultimately vulnerable.  We identify three distinct types of obfuscated gradients and develop targeted attack techniques to overcome each one.\n\nOur investigation reveals that obfuscated gradients are surprisingly prevalent.  In a case study of defenses presented at ICLR 2018, we found that 7 out of 9 \"secure\" defenses relied on this deceptive tactic.  Our new attack methods successfully circumvented 6 of these defenses entirely and partially broke another one, all within the original threat model claimed by the authors.\n\nThese findings highlight the need for a more rigorous evaluation of defenses against adversarial examples. Obfuscated gradients can create a false sense of security, leading to the deployment of vulnerable systems.

We present two straightforward yet effective strategies for addressing this challenge, enabling faster training and more efficient models without compromising performance.\n\nOur first approach reimagines the structure of the LSTM matrices themselves, decomposing them into products of smaller matrices. This \"matrix factorization by design\" reduces the overall parameter count, leading to leaner and more computationally efficient models.\n\nThe second strategy, partitioning, focuses on dividing the LSTM's core components \u2013 the weight matrices, input vectors, and hidden states \u2013 into independent groups. This partitioning allows for parallel processing, dramatically accelerating training by distributing the workload across multiple computational units.\n\nBoth methods, while conceptually simple, yield impressive results.

However, a key question has remained unanswered: can practical encoders and decoders achieve the theoretical limits suggested by the RDPF?\n\nThis work addresses this fundamental question, building upon the theoretical foundation laid by Li and El Gamal (2018).  We demonstrate that the RDPF is indeed achievable using a specific class of codes: stochastic, variable-length codes.  \n\nOur contributions are twofold:\n\n1. **Achievability Proof:** We prove the existence of stochastic, variable-length codes that can achieve the rate specified by the RDPF, bridging the gap between theory and practice.\n\n2. **Lower Bound:** We further establish that the RDPF serves as a lower bound on the achievable rate for this class of codes, meaning that no code within this class can compress data at a rate lower than that dictated by the RDPF while maintaining the desired perceptual quality.\n\nThese results significantly advance our understanding of the RDPF and its practical implications for lossy compression.  By proving the achievability of the RDPF and establishing its role as a lower bound, we provide a strong theoretical foundation for developing new and efficient compression algorithms that optimize for both rate and perceptual quality.  \n", "This paper presents Neural Phrase-based Machine Translation (NPMT), a machine translation model that explicitly models phrase structures in the target language using Sleep-WAke Networks (SWAN).  To overcome the monotonic alignment limitation of SWAN, NPMT incorporates a layer for local reordering of the input sequence.\n\nUnlike most neural machine translation (NMT) systems that rely on attention mechanisms, NPMT generates translations by sequentially outputting phrases, enabling linear-time decoding.

This reduction in distortion is proportional to K/N, where N represents the data dimensionality and K denotes the sparsity level.\n\nExtending this concept to the realm of DNNs, we introduce a \"locally linear\" model that provides a theoretical foundation for understanding and analyzing adversarial attacks and defenses.
