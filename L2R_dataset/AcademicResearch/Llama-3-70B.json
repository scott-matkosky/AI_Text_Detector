We reveal the profound implications of this principle by connecting it to the interplay of orbits and stabilizers of group actions. Although neural networks themselves don't form groups, we discover the existence of \"shadow\" groups that serve as close approximations.\n\nOver these shadow groups, pretraining becomes equivalent to searching for features with minimal orbits, which are intuitively the simplest. This explains why Deep Learning networks learn simple features first.

These approaches involve computing representations for both users and items based on observed ratings, which are subsequently utilized for prediction purposes. However, these transductive methods are inherently limited in their ability to accommodate new users entering the system without any prior ratings, a phenomenon commonly referred to as the \"user cold-start\" problem. A prevalent strategy in this context involves soliciting a limited number of initial ratings from these incoming users. This paper proposes a novel model designed to address the dual challenges of (i) identifying optimal questions to pose and (ii) constructing efficient representations from this limited information. Furthermore, this model can be applied in more traditional (warm) contexts.

Building on the strengths of traditional Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), which excels at preserving class distinctions and reducing dimensionality for various classification tasks, we integrate LDA with a deep neural network. This innovative combination can be viewed as a non-linear extension of classic LDA. Rather than focusing solely on maximizing the likelihood of target labels for individual data points, our method employs an objective function that encourages the network to generate feature distributions characterized by: (a) minimal variation within the same class and (b) significant variation between different classes. Our objective function is derived from the general LDA eigenvalue problem, allowing for efficient training using stochastic gradient descent and back-propagation.

This measure is calculated by exponentiating a weighted sum of rectified and exponentiated components, plus a constant. But that's not all - we take it to the next level by optimizing the parameters of the full transformation over a vast database of natural images. Our goal? To directly minimize the negentropy of the responses. The result? A transformation that substantially Gaussianizes the data, outperforming alternative methods like ICA and radial Gaussianization. And the best part? This transformation is not only differentiable but also efficiently invertible, which means it can be used to create a density model on images. We've seen that samples from this model are eerily similar to real natural image patches.

However, this approach has its limitations. By mapping words to a density, rather than a single point, we can unlock a wealth of benefits. For instance, we can better capture the uncertainty surrounding a word's meaning and its relationships with others, and more naturally express asymmetrical connections that don't fit neatly into traditional similarity measures like dot product or cosine similarity. Moreover, density-based representations allow for more flexible and expressive decision boundaries.

This transformation involves two stages: first, a linear transformation, and then a normalization step where each component is divided by a pooled activity measure. This measure is calculated by exponentiating a weighted sum of rectified and exponentiated components, plus a constant. We optimize the parameters of this transformation (including the linear transform, exponents, weights, and constant) using a database of natural images, with the goal of minimizing the negentropy of the responses. The resulting optimized transformation effectively Gaussianizes the data, achieving a significantly lower mutual information between transformed components compared to alternative methods such as ICA and radial Gaussianization. Notably, this transformation is differentiable and can be efficiently inverted, allowing it to induce a density model on images. We demonstrate that samples generated from this model are visually similar to natural image patches.

Given that the loss function to be minimized for the entire dataset is an aggregation of individual datapoint loss functions, it is intuitive that datapoints with the highest loss values should be prioritized (selected in a batch) more frequently. However, the limitations of this intuition and the proper control of selection pressure over time remain open questions. We propose a simple strategy wherein all datapoints are ranked according to their latest known loss values, and the probability of selection decays exponentially as a function of rank. Our experimental results on the MNIST dataset suggest that selecting batches accelerates both AdaDelta and Adam by a factor of approximately 5.", "We propose a scalable semi-supervised learning approach for graph-structured data using an efficient graph-based convolutional neural network.

Similar to traditional GANs, the generator is trained to produce samples with minimal energy, while the discriminator aims to assign high energy to these generated samples. By treating the discriminator as an energy function, we can explore a range of architectures and loss functions beyond the standard binary classifier. One example of the EBGAN framework is an auto-encoder architecture, where the energy is measured by the reconstruction error, replacing the traditional discriminator. We find that this approach leads to more stable training compared to regular GANs.

By building on recent breakthroughs in Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes, DVBF can efficiently handle intractable inference distributions using variational inference. This enables the method to effectively process highly nonlinear data with temporal and spatial dependencies, such as image sequences, without requiring prior domain knowledge. Our experimental results demonstrate that allowing backpropagation through transitions reinforces the assumptions of the state space model and significantly enhances the informativeness of the latent embedding, ultimately enabling realistic long-term predictions.", "Traditional dialog systems are limited because they require a lot of customization for each new domain. End-to-end dialog systems, which are trained on dialog data, can overcome this limitation. However, the success of end-to-end systems in casual conversations may not translate to goal-oriented applications. This paper proposes a testbed to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of end-to-end dialog systems in goal-oriented applications, using restaurant reservations as an example. Our system, based on Memory Networks, can perform well but not perfectly, and can learn to perform complex operations. We compared our system to a traditional slot-filling approach and found similar results on data from the Dialog State Tracking Challenge and an online concierge service.", "Imagine you're trying to teach a computer to understand and process language. One way to do this is by using a type of training called adversarial training, which helps the computer learn more accurately. However, this method doesn't work well with certain types of language data, like the way words are represented in computers.\n\nWe've found a way to adapt this training method to work with language data by making small changes to the way words are understood by the computer, rather than changing the words themselves. This new approach has achieved the best results so far in several tests, and we've also found that it helps the computer learn more efficiently and avoid mistakes.\n\nWe've made our code available online for others to use and build upon. This could have exciting implications for the development of artificial intelligence and natural language processing.", "The unsupervised learning of probabilistic models constitutes a fundamental and intricate challenge in the realm of machine learning. The design of models that facilitate tractable learning, sampling, inference, and evaluation is essential to addressing this problem. This paper presents an extension to the existing space of such models through the incorporation of real-valued non-volume preserving (real NVP) transformations, a class of powerful, invertible, and learnable transformations. The resulting unsupervised learning algorithm enables exact computation of log-likelihood, exact sampling, exact inference of latent variables, and an interpretable latent space. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated through its application to natural image modeling on four datasets, with evaluations conducted via sampling, log-likelihood assessment, and latent variable manipulation.", "This study explores the structure of view manifolds in the feature spaces of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We aim to answer several key questions:\n\n* Do CNNs learn viewpoint-invariant representations?\n* How do they achieve viewpoint invariance?\n* Is it by merging or separating view manifolds while preserving them?\n* At which layer is viewpoint invariance achieved?\n* How can we measure the structure of view manifolds at each layer of a deep CNN?\n* How does fine-tuning a pre-trained CNN on a multi-view dataset affect the representation at each layer?\n\nTo answer these questions, we propose a method to quantify the deformation and degeneracy of view manifolds in CNN layers.

But we'd like to offer a different take on what's really going on. In our view, importance-weighted autoencoders are actually optimizing the standard variational lower bound, just with a more complex distribution. We'll walk you through the math to prove it, show you an even tighter lower bound, and give you a visual representation of the implicit importance-weighted distribution that emerges.", "We've developed a formula to measure how well feedforward neural networks will perform on new data.

Despite numerous attempts to develop robustness against these threats, most proposed defenses have been rapidly compromised by subsequent attacks. In fact, a staggering 50% of defenses presented at ICLR 2018 have already been breached. To overcome this challenge, we turn to formal verification methods.

The result? An AI that's poised to transform the field of reinforcement learning.", "Machine learning classifiers are often susceptible to adversarial attacks, which involve making subtle modifications to input data to alter the classifier's prediction without noticeably changing the input from a human perspective. To combat this, we have developed three methods to identify adversarial images. These methods force would-be attackers to either make their adversarial images less anomalous, thereby reducing their effectiveness, or risk being detected. Notably, our most effective detection method reveals that adversarial images tend to place unusual emphasis on lower-ranked principal components, as identified through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Additional details on our detection methods and a visually informative saliency map can be found in the appendix.", "We present a novel, principled approach to kernel learning, grounded in a Fourier-analytic framework for characterizing translation-invariant and rotation-invariant kernels. This method generates a sequence of feature maps, iteratively optimizing the SVM margin.

However, this sequential design makes it difficult to process data in parallel within a single instance, leading to slow deployment in time-sensitive applications. This limitation is particularly pronounced when dealing with longer texts. To address this issue, we propose an alternative approach using a convolutional architecture. By replacing recurrent units with simple dilated convolutional units, we achieve results comparable to the state of the art on two question answering tasks, while simultaneously achieving speedups of up to two orders of magnitude for question answering.", "This report serves a triple purpose.

To ensure transparency and accessibility, all source code used for reproduction is publicly available.", "Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) were initially developed as probabilistic generative models for approximate Bayesian inference. However, the introduction of \u03b2-VAEs expanded their application to areas like representation learning, clustering, and lossy data compression by allowing a trade-off between the information content of the latent representation and the distortion of reconstructed data. This paper re-examines this trade-off in the context of hierarchical VAEs, which have multiple layers of latent variables. We identify a class of inference models where the rate can be split into contributions from each layer, allowing independent tuning.

Our results provide practical guidance on which rate-space region to target for a specific application.", "In the realm of network analysis, methods that learn node representations play a pivotal role, as they facilitate a wide range of downstream learning tasks. We introduce Graph2Gauss, a novel approach that efficiently learns versatile node embeddings on large-scale (attributed) graphs, yielding exceptional performance on tasks such as link prediction and node classification. Unlike conventional approaches that represent nodes as point vectors in a low-dimensional continuous space, our method embeds each node as a Gaussian distribution, thereby capturing uncertainty about the representation. Moreover, we propose an unsupervised method that tackles inductive learning scenarios and is applicable to diverse types of graphs, including plain/attributed and directed/undirected graphs. By harnessing both the network structure and associated node attributes, we can generalize to unseen nodes without additional training.

You show it lots of examples, and it gets really good at it. But, what if someone intentionally adds some tiny changes to the pictures that make the computer think a dog is a cat? This is called an \"adversarial example\", and it's a big problem in machine learning.\n\nOur goal is to understand why these adversarial examples work, and how to make computers better at recognizing them. We're not trying to come up with a single solution, but rather to figure out the underlying reasons why they're a problem.\n\nWe're using some advanced math concepts to study how computers and humans see things differently. By looking at how computers and humans process information, we can identify the key reasons why computers get fooled by adversarial examples.\n\nWhat we've found is that if a computer is relying on the wrong information, even just a little bit, it can be easily tricked. But, if we can teach the computer to focus on the right information, it can be both accurate and resistant to these tricks. This is important because it means we can make computers that are better at recognizing pictures, and more secure from being manipulated.", "We establish a comprehensive framework for evaluating and refining the ability of agents to gather information in an efficient manner. This framework consists of a range of tasks that require agents to search through partially-observed environments to collect and assemble fragmented information, ultimately achieving specific objectives. By integrating deep learning architectures with reinforcement learning techniques, we develop agents capable of solving these tasks. We influence the behavior of these agents by combining external rewards with internal motivations. Our empirical results show that these agents learn to actively and intelligently seek out new information to reduce uncertainty, while also leveraging the information they have already obtained.", "We propose a neural network language model extension that adapts predictions based on recent history.

Our results showed that the FlyHash model outperformed the others, particularly in terms of data encoding efficiency.", "In the peer-review process, reviewers typically provide scores for papers, which are then used by Area Chairs or Program Chairs to inform their decisions. However, these scores are often limited by the human ability to quantify opinions, resulting in a large number of ties and significant loss of information. To address this issue, conferences have started asking reviewers to provide a ranking of the papers they've reviewed, in addition to scores. While this approach shows promise, it presents two key challenges. Firstly, there is no standardized way to incorporate ranking information into the decision-making process, leading to arbitrariness. Secondly, there is a lack of suitable interfaces and methods to effectively utilize this data, resulting in inefficiencies. \n\nOur approach tackles these challenges by integrating ranking information into the scores in a principled manner. The output of our method is an updated score for each review that incorporates the rankings. By doing so, we ensure that rankings are consistently incorporated into the updated scores for all papers, mitigating arbitrariness, and allowing for seamless integration with existing interfaces and workflows designed for scores. We evaluate our method using synthetic datasets and real peer-review data from the ICLR 2017 conference, and find that it reduces error by approximately 30% compared to the best-performing baseline on the ICLR 2017 data.", "Uncovering Hidden Biases: A Groundbreaking Study Reveals the Surprising Impact of Author Metadata on Academic Publishing\n\nIn the cutthroat world of academic publishing, getting your research published in a top-tier journal or conference can make or break a career. But what if the outcome is influenced by more than just the quality of your work? Recent studies have hinted at a disturbing trend: status bias in the peer-review process. We decided to dig deeper.\n\nOur investigation analyzed a massive dataset of 5,313 borderline submissions to the prestigious International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) from 2017 to 2022. Using a rigorous cause-and-effect analysis, we uncovered some startling findings. It appears that author metadata \u2013 think institutional affiliation and prestige \u2013 has a significant impact on the final decision of area chairs.\n\nBut here's the twist: our results suggest that papers from high-ranking institutions (think top 30% or 20%) are actually less favored by area chairs compared to their matched counterparts. This phenomenon was consistent across two different matched designs, with odds ratios of 0.82 and 0.83 respectively.\n\nSo, what does this mean for the future of academic publishing? Our study sheds light on the complex interactions between authors, reviewers, and area chairs in the peer-review system.

Our observation is that when faced with adversarial examples from a particular class, these specialists tend to mislabel them into a limited set of incorrect classes. Therefore, we believe that an ensemble of these specialists can more effectively identify and reject misleading instances, characterized by high disagreement (entropy) among their decisions when confronted with adversaries. Our experimental results support this interpretation, suggesting a promising approach to improve the system's robustness against adversarial examples by incorporating a rejection mechanism, rather than attempting to classify them accurately at all costs.", "Introducing Neural Phrase-based Machine Translation (NPMT)\n\nWe propose a novel approach to machine translation that explicitly models phrase structures in output sequences using Sleep-WAke Networks (SWAN), a recently developed segmentation-based sequence modeling method.

Unlike other generative adversarial networks (GANs), our model learns to create images in a more thoughtful way. It starts by generating the background and foregrounds separately, and then stitches them together in a way that makes sense. But that's not all - it also figures out the perfect appearance, shape, and pose for each object in the foreground. The best part?

Alice gives Bob a task to complete, and then Bob tries to do it. We're focusing on two types of environments: ones that can be easily reversed, and ones that can be reset. Alice gives Bob the task by doing a series of actions, and then Bob has to either undo them or repeat them.

To address these challenges, we introduce a general framework that initially acquires versatile skills in a pre-training environment and subsequently leverages these skills to accelerate learning in downstream tasks. Our approach combines the benefits of intrinsic motivation and hierarchical methods, where the learning of useful skills is directed by a single proxy reward that requires minimal domain knowledge of the downstream tasks. A high-level policy is then trained on top of these skills, substantially enhancing exploration and enabling the tackling of sparse rewards in downstream tasks. To efficiently pre-train a broad range of skills, we employ Stochastic Neural Networks in conjunction with an information-theoretic regularizer. Our experiments demonstrate that this combination effectively learns a diverse set of interpretable skills in a sample-efficient manner, resulting in significant and uniform performance improvements across a wide range of downstream tasks.", "In the world of AI, a revolution is underway. Deep generative models have been making waves in recent years, and two rockstar families - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) - have been stealing the show. For a long time, these two superstars were thought to be operating in separate universes, with their own unique styles and fan bases. But what if we told you that they're not as different as they seem? This paper is all about bridging the gap between GANs and VAEs, and showing that they're actually two sides of the same coin. By flipping the script on how we think about sample generation, we can reveal the hidden connections between these two powerhouses. And the best part? This newfound understanding lets us borrow tricks from one camp to supercharge the other. We've already seen some amazing results, from turbocharging GANs with VAE-style importance weighting to giving VAEs a boost with adversarial generated samples.

Through a range of experiments, we demonstrated ODIN's versatility across various network architectures and datasets. The results are striking, with ODIN significantly outperforming the baseline approach and setting a new standard for this task.

However, training RNNs on long sequences can be challenging due to slow inference, vanishing gradients, and difficulty in capturing long-term dependencies. These issues are closely tied to the large, sequential computational graph that results from unfolding the RNN in time during backpropagation. To address these challenges, we propose the Skip RNN model, which extends existing RNN models by learning to selectively skip state updates, thereby reducing the effective size of the computational graph. Additionally, the model can be incentivized to perform fewer state updates through a budget constraint. Our evaluation of the proposed model on various tasks shows that it can significantly reduce the number of required RNN updates while maintaining, and sometimes even improving, the performance of baseline RNN models.

Despite their success, the reason why skip connections work so well remains unclear. In this study, we offer a new explanation for the benefits of skip connections in training deep networks. One of the main challenges in training deep networks is that they can get stuck in singularities, which are caused by the fact that the model is not uniquely defined. There are several types of singularities that can occur, including those caused by node permutation, node elimination, and linear dependence between nodes. These singularities create \"bad\" areas in the loss landscape that slow down the learning process. We argue that skip connections help eliminate these singularities by breaking node symmetry, reducing node elimination, and decreasing linear dependence. Additionally, skip connections move the network away from these \"bad\" areas and reshape the landscape to make learning easier. Our hypotheses are supported by both simplified models and experiments with real-world datasets.", "As part of the ICLR 2018 Reproducibility Challenge, we embarked on an exciting journey to recreate the findings of the paper \"Natural Language Inference over Interaction Space\" submitted to the conference.

By designing a cascade of homeomorphic layers, we create the i-RevNet, a fully invertible network that preserves all input information up to the final class projection. Overcoming the challenge of local inversion ill-conditioning, we provide an explicit inverse.

Through supervised regression, SPU then translates the optimal non-parameterized policy into a parameterized policy, generating new samples. Notably, SPU is versatile and can be applied to both discrete and continuous action spaces, accommodating a range of proximity constraints. We demonstrate how SPU can be used to address the Natural Policy Gradient and Trust Region Policy Optimization (NPG/TRPO) problems, as well as the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) problem. Furthermore, our implementation of SPU is significantly simpler than TRPO. Our comprehensive experiments reveal that SPU surpasses TRPO in sample efficiency on Mujoco simulated robotic tasks and outperforms PPO on Atari video game tasks.", "Unlock the Secrets of Video Prediction Networks with Moving Symbols: A Game-Changing Synthetic Dataset!\n\nImagine having a powerful tool to objectively evaluate and improve video prediction networks.
