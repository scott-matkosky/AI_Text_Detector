What representations does it capture? How do higher-order representations emerge? We explore these questions using group theory, introducing a novel theoretical approach to understanding Deep Learning.\n\nA significant reason for the recent advancements in Deep Learning is a crucial algorithmic step known as **pretraining**. This involves first discovering a good generative model for the input samples and then iteratively repeating this process layer by layer. We reveal deeper implications of this principle by connecting it to the relationship between orbits and stabilizers in group actions. Although neural networks themselves may not constitute groups, we demonstrate the existence of **shadow groups** whose elements closely approximate the networks' behavior.\n\nWithin these shadow groups, the pretraining step, initially designed to better initialize a network, transforms into a search for features with minimal orbits, which are intuitively the simplest features. This explains why a deep learning network first learns simple features. Furthermore, we show that this principle, when applied to deeper layers, can capture higher-order representations. Consequently, representation complexity increases as the layers deepen.", "Introducing the \"stacked what-where auto-encoders\" (SWWAE) \u2013 a cutting-edge architecture that seamlessly blends discriminative and generative pathways for a unified take on supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning, all without the need for sampling during training.

Rather than optimizing filters in pre-trained networks with more efficient counterparts, we build a set of compact basis filters from the ground up. During the training process, the network learns to combine these basis filters to form complex, discriminative filters suitable for image classification tasks. A new weight initialization strategy is employed to effectively set the initial connection weights in convolutional layers that consist of groups of diverse filter shapes. We validate our technique by implementing it on several established CNN architectures and training these models from scratch using the CIFAR, ILSVRC, and MIT Places datasets. Our findings demonstrate that our approach achieves similar or superior accuracy compared to traditional CNNs while significantly reducing computational requirements. \n\nFor instance, applying our method to an enhanced version of the VGG-11 network with global max-pooling, we obtain comparable validation accuracy while using 41% less computational resources and only 24% of the parameters of the original VGG-11 model.

This paper introduces a model designed to address two challenges: (i) identifying the best questions to ask new users and (ii) creating effective representations from limited data. Additionally, the model performs well in standard (warm) scenarios. Our approach is tested on four datasets, demonstrating improved performance over baselines in both traditional CF and cold-start contexts.", "We introduce a sophisticated deep learning framework for capturing intricate, high-dimensional probability distributions, termed Non-linear Independent Component Estimation (NICE).

For instance, it is possible to train Maxout networks using 10-bit multiplications.", "Multiple instance learning (MIL) can help reduce the expensive need for detailed annotations in tasks like semantic segmentation by using less precise supervision. We introduce a new MIL approach for multi-class semantic segmentation using a fully convolutional network. This method aims to train a semantic segmentation model using only weak image-level labels. The training process, which is end-to-end, optimizes both the representation and the assignment of pixel labels. Fully convolutional training works with inputs of any size, avoids the need for object proposal preprocessing, and provides a pixelwise loss map to identify hidden instances.

This curvature information is derived from the local statistics of the stochastic first-order gradients, providing element-wise insights into the loss function. Additionally, we propose a new variance reduction technique designed to accelerate convergence. Our preliminary experiments with deep neural networks demonstrate superior performance when compared to widely used stochastic gradient algorithms.", "Imagine watching a 3D object as it moves around you. Your view of it changes, right? Well, when this happens, both the image you see and the visual model a computer has learned get updated. Here's a fascinating idea: a great visual model adapts smoothly to movements in the scene. Applying the theory of group representations, we've discovered that this kind of model can actually break down into a mix of simple, fundamental parts.\n\nWe've also found something amazing: these basic parts, or 'irreducible representations,' have unique statistical properties\u2014they\u2019re decorrelated under certain conditions. When you only see part of a scene, like through a camera, things get trickier. The movement doesn't transform the images in a straightforward way. So, we need to make educated guesses about a deeper representation that does change predictably.\n\nTo bring this concept to life, look at our model of rotating NORB objects. It uses hidden representations of the intricate 3D rotation group, SO(3), to make sense of the movement. This approach helps the computer understand and represent the object's rotation accurately, even when viewed from different angles.", "Finding the most efficient Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) is crucial for applications in recommendation systems and in handling vast numbers of classes in classification tasks. Recent studies have explored solutions such as locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) and tree-based methods to achieve approximate MIPS in sublinear time. In this paper, we introduce a straightforward alternative approach using adaptations of the k-means clustering algorithm. Specifically, we apply spherical k-means clustering after transforming the MIPS problem into a Maximum Cosine Similarity Search (MCSS). Our experiments on two standard benchmarks for recommendation systems and on sizeable word embedding vocabularies demonstrate that this uncomplicated method significantly accelerates search processes while maintaining retrieval precision, outperforming current top-tier hashing-based and tree-based methods. Additionally, this method delivers more reliable retrievals in the presence of noisy queries.", "The variational autoencoder (VAE), introduced by Kingma and Welling in 2014, is a generative model consisting of two networks: a top-down generative network and a bottom-up recognition network. The recognition network approximates posterior inference, often assuming that the posterior distribution can be factored and its parameters can be estimated through nonlinear regression from observations. However, we find that the VAE objective can result in overly simplified representations that do not fully utilize the network's modeling capacity.\n\nWe introduce the importance weighted autoencoder (IWAE), which has the same architecture as the VAE but uses a more accurate log-likelihood lower bound obtained through importance weighting. In the IWAE, the recognition network uses multiple samples to better approximate the posterior, giving it more flexibility to model complex distributions that the VAE cannot handle. Our empirical results show that IWAEs learn more detailed latent space representations than VAEs, which leads to better performance on density estimation benchmarks.", "This work explores how using lower precision data in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) affects their accuracy during classification. Specifically, it looks at networks where different layers can use different precision levels. The main finding is that CNNs' tolerance to lower precision data varies not only between different networks but also within individual networks. Using varied precision per layer could lead to energy and performance benefits. This study examines how error tolerance varies across layers and proposes a method to find a low precision setup that maintains high accuracy. By analyzing various CNNs, it shows that, compared to a standard implementation using 32-bit floating-point data for all layers, and with less than 1% decrease in relative accuracy, the data footprint of these networks can be reduced by an average of 74% and up to 92%.", "The effectiveness of graph-based semi-supervised algorithms hinges on the quality of the graph constructed from the given instances. Typically, these instances are initially represented in vector form before being used to form a graph. The graph's construction depends on a metric derived from the vector space, which determines the weights of connections between entities. Traditionally, a distance or similarity measure based on the Euclidean norm is used for this purpose. However, we argue that the Euclidean norm may not always be the optimal choice for efficiently solving the task. Therefore, we propose an algorithm designed to learn the most suitable vector representation for constructing a graph that can address the task more effectively.", "Hypernymy, textual entailment, and image captioning can be viewed as specific instances of a unified visual-semantic hierarchy encompassing words, sentences, and images.

Our results show that the resulting representations enhance performance in hypernym prediction and image-caption retrieval compared to current approaches.", "We introduce Local Distributional Smoothness (LDS), a groundbreaking smoothness criterion for statistical models that can be used as a regularization term to enhance the model's distributional smoothness. We call this LDS-based regularization technique Virtual Adversarial Training (VAT). The LDS at a given input point is defined as the KL-divergence robustness of the model's distribution against localized perturbations around that point. VAT is akin to adversarial training but stands out by determining the adversarial direction based solely on the model distribution, independent of label information, making it ideal for semi-supervised learning.\n\nVAT is computationally efficient: for neural networks, the approximated gradient of LDS can be computed with just three pairs of forward and backward propagations.

Identifying these relations automatically is tough because it requires understanding the meaning of the linked sentences. Furthermore, it\u2019s challenging because it\u2019s not enough just to understand each sentence individually; the connections between smaller elements, like mentions of entities, also matter.\n\nOur solution involves creating meaning representations by building up the syntactic parse tree. Unlike previous approaches, we also create representations for entity mentions using a new method that works in a downward manner. We predict discourse relations using these representations not only for sentences but also for the key entities within them. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of predicting implicit discourse relations in the Penn Discourse Treebank compared to previous methods.", "In this study, we introduce a new approach for combining two recent research areas: unsupervised learning of shallow semantics, such as semantic roles, and the factorization of relations in text and knowledge bases. Our model includes two key components: (1) an encoding component, which uses a semantic role labeling model to predict roles based on a comprehensive set of syntactic and lexical features; (2) a reconstruction component, which uses a tensor factorization model to predict argument fillers based on the roles. When these components are jointly optimized to reduce errors in argument reconstruction, the resulting roles align closely with those defined in annotated resources.

However, it should be noted that there is a significant lack of theoretical guarantees regarding the generalization ability of a classifier linked to a specific metric. The theoretical framework of $(\\epsilon, \\gamma, \\tau)$-good similarity functions (Balcan et al., 2008) was among the first efforts to connect the attributes of a similarity function with those of a linear classifier utilizing it. In this paper, we build upon and complete this theory by offering a new generalization bound for the associated classifier based on the algorithmic robustness framework.", "We introduce the multiplicative recurrent neural network as a general framework for understanding compositional meaning in language, and we assess its performance on fine-grained sentiment analysis. We draw a link to previously studied matrix-space models for compositionality, demonstrating that these are specific instances of the multiplicative recurrent network.

We show that some high-dimensional functions have a narrow range of values containing most of their critical points, unlike the wider range seen in low-dimensional cases. Our simulations support previous theoretical work on spin glasses that proves the existence of such a range as the dimension increases. Additionally, our experiments with teacher-student networks on the MNIST dataset reveal a similar phenomenon in deep networks. Finally, we observe that both gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent methods reach this range within the same number of steps.", "We've come up with a new way to look at photos using a fresh statistical model. The idea is that how local areas respond to a bunch of linear filters is described as jointly Gaussian with zero mean, and the covariance changes slowly over different parts of the image. We focus on optimizing these filters to minimize the nuclear norms of their local activations, which basically means we're encouraging a flexible form of sparsity without being tied to a specific dictionary or system.\n\nWhen we optimize the filters this way, they tend to be oriented and bandpass, and their responses are highly locally correlated. Interestingly, we found that you can almost perfectly reconstruct images just from these local filter response covariances, even when using low-rank approximations, without much visual loss or increase in MSE.\n\nThis approach looks really promising for various tasks like denoising, compressing images, and representing textures. It could also be a great foundation for more complex hierarchical decompositions in the future.", "Modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for object recognition typically use alternating convolution and max-pooling layers followed by a few fully connected layers. We question the necessity of these components and find that max-pooling can be replaced by a convolutional layer with increased stride, maintaining accuracy on several benchmarks.

We also offer a fully operational implementation of the described method.", "Refined text: \n\nImplementing suitable lateral connections between the encoder and decoder in a denoising autoencoder (dAE) allows higher layers to concentrate on invariant representations. Unlike regular autoencoders, where detailed information must flow through the highest layers, lateral connections from the encoder to the decoder reduce this burden. This setup enables abstract invariant features to be effectively translated into detailed reconstructions by modulating the strength of the lateral connections. Experiments comparing three dAE structures\u2014those with modulated lateral connections, additive lateral connections, and no lateral connections\u2014using real-world images, demonstrate that modulated lateral connections 1) enhance the accuracy of the input probability model, as evidenced by improved denoising performance; 2) lead to a faster progression of invariance in representations towards the higher layers; and 3) promote the development of diverse invariant poolings.", "We have developed a new method for visualizing and improving the invariances in learned representations. Specifically, we examine a general form of invariance called linearization, where the effect of a transformation is restricted to a low-dimensional subspace. Using two reference images that typically differ due to some transformation, we generate a sequence of images that trace a minimally-extended path between them in the representation space, known as a \"representational geodesic.\" If the representation linearizes the transformation between the reference images, this sequence should progressively reflect the transformation.\n\nWe apply this method to evaluate the invariance properties of a cutting-edge image classification network. Our findings indicate that the geodesics for image pairs differing by translation, rotation, and dilation do not correspond to their respective transformations. Additionally, our method offers a solution to these shortcomings.

These slight input perturbations can throw off a network's classification, but we've got groundbreaking news. In the past few years, numerous techniques have been explored to enhance robustness against these adversarial examples. The twist? Many of these defenses have quickly crumbled under subsequent attacks \u2013 in fact, over half of the proposed defenses at ICLR 2018 have already been compromised. But don't worry, we have a game-changing solution: formal verification techniques! We're thrilled to reveal that we've developed a method to construct provably minimally distorted adversarial examples. With this revolutionary approach, we can take any neural network and input sample and create adversarial examples that we guarantee are minimally distorted. Even better, our approach shows that the recent ICLR defense strategy of adversarial retraining significantly amplifies the distortion required for crafting adversarial examples by an astounding factor of 4.2! Let's transform the future of neural networks together!", "Sure! Here's a more dynamic version of the text:\n\n\"We've taken Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes to the next level by using it for posterior inference of Stick-Breaking process weights. This breakthrough lets us introduce the Stick-Breaking Variational Autoencoder (SB-VAE)\u2014a cutting-edge, Bayesian nonparametric twist on the variational autoencoder. What sets the SB-VAE apart is its ability to use a latent representation with a stochastic dimensionality. Our experiments reveal that both the SB-VAE and its semi-supervised variant excel in learning highly discriminative latent representations, frequently surpassing the performance of traditional Gaussian VAEs.\"", "We introduce a method for training multiple neural networks at the same time. By using the tensor trace norm, we encourage each network to reuse parameters from the others, which is the core idea of multi-task learning. Unlike many existing models, we don't set a fixed parameter sharing strategy. Instead, our approach allows all layers to potentially share parameters, and the sharing strategy is determined based on the data.", "This paper unveils a groundbreaking actor-critic deep reinforcement learning agent with experience replay, exhibiting unparalleled stability, sample efficiency, and exceptional performance across formidable environments, notably the discrete 57-game Atari domain and multiple continuous control challenges. Key innovations feature truncated importance sampling with bias correction, revolutionary stochastic dueling network architectures, and an advanced trust region policy optimization method.", "Many machine learning classifiers are susceptible to adversarial perturbations, which subtly alter inputs to change classifier predictions without noticeable differences to human perception. We use three methods to detect these adversarial images. Adversaries must reduce the pathology of their images to evade our detectors, or they will fail. Our top detection method shows that adversarial images disproportionately emphasize lower-ranked principal components from PCA. Additional detectors and a colorful saliency map are provided in the appendix.", "We introduce a robust method for kernel learning grounded in a Fourier-analytic framework that characterizes translation-invariant or rotation-invariant kernels. This technique generates a succession of feature maps that iteratively enhance the SVM margin. We offer solid guarantees for both optimality and generalization, and interpret our algorithm as online equilibrium-finding dynamics within a specific two-player min-max game. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets reveal that our approach scales effectively and consistently outperforms existing methods based on random features.", "Current top reading comprehension models use recurrent neural networks (RNNs). These networks work well with language because they process information in order. However, they can't handle multiple pieces of information at once, causing delays, especially with longer texts. This makes them less suitable for scenarios where quick responses are needed. We propose a new method using a convolutional architecture instead of RNNs. By using dilated convolutions, we achieve similar results to the best models in two question-answering tasks, but with much faster processing speeds.", "This report serves several purposes. First, it investigates the reproducibility of the paper \"On the regularization of Wasserstein GANs\" (2018). Second, it reproduces five key aspects from the paper's experiments: learning speed, stability, robustness against hyperparameters, accuracy in estimating the Wasserstein distance, and different sampling methods. Finally, it identifies which contributions can be reproduced and the associated resource costs. All source code for reproduction is publicly available.", "Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) started out (thanks to Kingma & Welling, 2014) as fancy probabilistic models where you do some complex Bayesian inference stuff. Then along came $\\beta$-VAEs (shoutout to Higgins et al., 2017) which changed the game. They expanded VAEs beyond just generative modeling to cool stuff like representation learning, clustering, and lossy data compression by letting you balance between the info content (\"bit rate\") of the latent representation and the distortion of the reconstructed data (thanks Alemi et al., 2018). \n\nIn this paper, we take a fresh look at this rate/distortion trade-off but for hierarchical VAEs, which are VAEs with multiple layers of latent variables. We found a way to split the rate into parts for each layer, so you can tweak them separately. We also figured out some theoretical limits on how well these layers perform in downstream tasks and backed up our theories with big experiments. Our results give useful tips for practitioners on where to aim in the rate-space for whatever you're working on.", "Methods for learning representations of nodes within a graph are pivotal in network analysis because they facilitate a broad range of subsequent learning tasks. In this context, we introduce Graph2Gauss, an innovative approach designed to efficiently learn versatile node embeddings on large-scale (attributed) graphs, exhibiting robust performance in tasks such as link prediction and node classification. Unlike most existing methods that depict nodes as point vectors within a low-dimensional continuous space, our approach embeds each node as a Gaussian distribution. This unique representation enables the capture of uncertainty regarding the node's representation.\n\nMoreover, we propose an unsupervised method that adeptly handles inductive learning scenarios and is versatile across various types of graphs, including plain/attributed and directed/undirected graphs. By leveraging both the network structure and the supplementary node attributes, our approach can generalize to previously unseen nodes without the need for further training. To derive these embeddings, we employ a personalized ranking framework concerning the node distances, which utilizes the natural ordering imposed by the network structure on the nodes.\n\nExtensive experiments conducted on real-world networks validate the superior performance of our method, demonstrating that it outperforms state-of-the-art network embedding techniques across several tasks. Additionally, the advantages of incorporating uncertainty into the model are evident. Through the analysis of this uncertainty, we can estimate the diversity within neighborhoods and detect the intrinsic latent dimensionality of a graph.", "This study investigates the application of self-ensembling techniques to visual domain adaptation challenges. Our method is based on the mean teacher model (Tarvainen et al., 2017) within the temporal ensembling framework (Laine et al., 2017), which has previously set new benchmarks in semi-supervised learning. We propose several modifications to enhance their approach for complex domain adaptation scenarios and assess its performance. Our technique demonstrates state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks, including our winning submission to the VISDA-2017 visual domain adaptation competition. In smaller image benchmarks, our method not only surpasses existing techniques but also achieves accuracy levels comparable to supervised classifiers.", "Machine learning models, including popular ones like deep neural networks, can be easily tricked by what's called adversarial examples. These are inputs that have tiny, deliberate changes that make the model produce wrong results, even though they look normal to humans. This paper isn't about creating a new method to avoid such problems; instead, it dives deep into understanding why these tricky inputs work. By using concepts from topology (a branch of math), we explain why a classifier (think of it as a decision-making model) can be fooled by adversarial examples. We compare the classifier ($f_1$) to an oracle ($f_2$), which could be something like human judgment, to find out how they're related. Our study lays out the exact conditions that make a classifier either weak or strong against these adversarial tricks, according to the human-like oracle. Surprisingly, we found that even a single unnecessary feature in the data can make the classifier not strong-robust. So, learning the right features is crucial for building a model that is both accurate and strong-robust against adversarial examples.", "We're excited to introduce a fun and engaging way to train and test the ability of agents to gather information efficiently. We've created a series of tasks where success means exploring a partially-observed environment to find bits of information that can be pieced together to achieve various goals. By blending deep learning architectures with reinforcement learning techniques, we've developed agents capable of solving these tasks. To guide their behavior, we use a mix of extrinsic and intrinsic rewards. Our experiments show that these agents learn to actively and smartly search for new information to reduce uncertainty, while making the most of the information they already have.", "We're introducing an enhancement to neural network language models that allows them to adjust their predictions based on recent history. Our approach simplifies memory-augmented networks by storing past hidden activations as memory and retrieving them via a dot product with the current hidden activation. This method is highly efficient and can handle large memory sizes. Additionally, we highlight similarities between the use of external memory in neural networks and cache models used in count-based language models. Our testing on various language model datasets shows that our method significantly outperforms current memory-augmented networks.", "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are highly successful deep generative models that rely on a two-player minimax game framework. However, the original objective function is modified to ensure stronger gradients during the generator's learning process. We propose a novel algorithm that alternates between density ratio estimation and f-divergence minimization. This algorithm provides a fresh perspective on understanding GANs and leverages insights from density ratio estimation research, such as the stability of different divergences and the utility of relative density ratios.", "We introduce an innovative framework for the generation of pop music. Our model employs a hierarchical Recurrent Neural Network, meticulously designed to encapsulate our extensive understanding of pop music composition through its layered architecture. Specifically, the basal layers are dedicated to melody creation, whereas the superior layers are responsible for the generation of drums and chords. Through a series of rigorous human studies, our generated music has demonstrated a marked preference over the outputs from Google's latest methodology. Furthermore, we showcase two intriguing applications of our framework: neural dancing and karaoke, and neural story singing.", "We analyze the eigenvalues of the Hessian of a loss function before and after training. The eigenvalue distribution comprises two distinct parts: the bulk, centered around zero, and the edges, dispersed away from zero. Our empirical evidence reveals that the bulk reflects the degree of over-parameterization in the system, while the edges are influenced by the input data.", "In this paper, we unveil an innovative feature extraction method designed to analyze program execution logs. Our approach begins with the automatic extraction of intricate patterns from a program's behavior graph. These patterns are then transformed into a continuous space via an autoencoder. We put our proposed features to the test on a real-world malicious software detection task, finding that the embedding space not only enhances detection but also reveals meaningful, interpretable structures within the pattern space.", "We evaluated the efficiency of the FlyHash model, which is an insect-inspired sparse neural network (Dasgupta et al., 2017), against comparable but non-sparse models in an embodied navigation task. This task involves a model controlling steering by comparing current visual inputs with memories stored from a training route. Our findings indicate that the FlyHash model outperforms the others, particularly in terms of data encoding efficiency.", "In the peer review process, reviewers are usually tasked with assigning scores to the papers they evaluate. These scores play a crucial role in aiding Area Chairs or Program Chairs in making decisions. To facilitate reviewers in quantifying their opinions despite cognitive limitations, the scores are typically provided in a quantized format. However, this approach often results in a significant number of tied scores, leading to considerable information loss. To address this issue, some conferences now also request reviewers to rank the papers they review in addition to scoring them.\n\nThis dual-scoring system introduces two main challenges. Firstly, there is no standardized method for using the ranking information, leading Area Chairs to handle it differently, or sometimes not at all, which can inject arbitrariness into the review process. Secondly, there are no effective interfaces or methods to incorporate the ranking information into existing workflows, causing inefficiencies.\n\nWe propose a systematic approach to integrate the ranking data with the traditional scores. Our method generates an updated score for each reviewed paper that includes the ranking information. This approach tackles the two primary challenges by (i) ensuring consistent incorporation of rankings into the scores for all papers to eliminate arbitrariness, and (ii) allowing the continued use of existing interfaces and workflows optimized for scores.\n\nOur method has been empirically evaluated on synthetic datasets and peer reviews from the ICLR 2017 conference. Results show a reduction in error by approximately 30% compared to the best-performing baseline on the ICLR 2017 data, demonstrating its effectiveness.", "Recent studies have explored status bias in academic peer review. This article analyzes the impact of author metadata on area chairs' decisions using a database of 5,313 borderline submissions to ICLR from 2017 to 2022. Employing a cause-and-effect analysis within Neyman and Rubin's potential outcomes framework, we found weak evidence linking author metadata to final decisions. Moreover, under additional assumptions, submissions from top-30% or top-20% institutions were less favored compared to their peers. This result held across two matched designs (odds ratio = 0.82 [95% CI: 0.67 to 1.00] and 0.83 [95% CI: 0.64 to 1.07]). We discussed these findings in the context of interactions between study units and peer-review agents.", "We introduce a variational approximation to the information bottleneck method established by Tishby et al. (1999). This novel approach enables the parameterization of the information bottleneck model through neural networks, incorporating the reparameterization trick to facilitate efficient training. We designate this method as the \"Deep Variational Information Bottleneck\" (Deep VIB). Our empirical evidence demonstrates that models trained using the VIB objective surpass those trained with alternative regularization techniques in terms of generalization performance and resilience against adversarial attacks.", "Attention networks have revolutionized deep neural networks by effectively embedding categorical inference. However, many tasks require capturing richer structural dependencies without sacrificing the benefits of end-to-end training. In this study, we enhance deep networks by integrating richer structural distributions through graphical models. Our structured attention networks build upon the basic attention mechanism, enabling us to extend attention beyond standard soft-selection to include partial segmentations and subtrees.\n\nWe introduce two innovative structured attention network classes: linear-chain conditional random fields and graph-based parsing models, detailing practical implementation as neural network layers. Experimental results demonstrate that these networks not only effectively incorporate structural biases but also significantly outperform baseline attention models in various synthetic and real-world tasks such as tree transduction, neural machine translation, question answering, and natural language inference. Moreover, models trained using this approach discover intriguing unsupervised hidden representations, showcasing the potential to generalize traditional attention mechanisms.", "We propose using a group of diverse specialists, each defined based on the confusion matrix. We noticed that adversarial instances from a specific class tend to be mislabeled into a small group of incorrect classes. Thus, we believe that a team of specialists can better identify and reject misleading instances by showing high disagreement in their decisions when faced with adversarial examples. Our experimental results support this idea and suggest that enhancing the system's ability to reject these instances can make it more robust against adversarial attacks, rather than attempting to classify them correctly at all costs.", "In this paper, we introduce Neural Phrase-based Machine Translation (NPMT). Our method uses Sleep-WAke Networks (SWAN) to clearly model phrase structures in the output text. To address SWAN's need for monotonic alignment, we add a new layer that allows for flexible (soft) local rearrangement of input sequences. Unlike other neural machine translation (NMT) methods that rely on attention-based decoding, NPMT outputs phrases directly in order and works in linear time. Our experiments show that NPMT performs better than strong NMT baselines on the IWSLT 2014 German-English/English-German and IWSLT 2015 English-Vietnamese translation tasks. We also found that our method generates meaningful phrases in the output languages.", "We introduce LR-GAN, an adversarial image generation model that incorporates scene structure and context. Unlike previous generative adversarial networks (GANs), LR-GAN learns to generate image backgrounds and foregrounds separately and recursively, seamlessly integrating the foregrounds with the background to produce a cohesive and natural image. For each foreground, the model independently generates its appearance, shape, and pose. The entire model operates in an unsupervised manner and is trained end-to-end using gradient descent methods. Our experiments show that LR-GAN produces more natural images with objects that are more easily recognizable by humans than those generated by DCGAN.", "We present a simple method that enables an agent to learn about its environment in an unsupervised manner. Our approach involves two versions of the same agent, named Alice and Bob, competing against each other. Alice proposes a task, and Bob tries to complete it. In this work, we focus on two types of environments: (nearly) reversible environments and environments that can be reset. Alice sets the task by performing a sequence of actions, which Bob must either undo or replicate, depending on the environment. Through a suitable reward system, Alice and Bob create a curriculum of exploration that facilitates unsupervised training of the agent. When Bob is later used for a reinforcement learning task within the environment, this unsupervised training reduces the number of supervised episodes required, and in some cases, leads to higher rewards.", "Maximum entropy modeling is a flexible and popular framework for creating statistical models using partial knowledge. Instead of the traditional method of directly optimizing over the continuous density, this paper introduces a new approach. We learn a smooth and invertible transformation that maps a simple distribution to the desired maximum entropy distribution. This process is complex because the objective (entropy) depends on the density itself. By using recent advancements in normalizing flow networks, we transform the maximum entropy problem into a finite-dimensional constrained optimization problem. We then solve this using a combination of stochastic optimization and the augmented Lagrangian method. Simulation results show our method is effective, and applications in finance and computer vision demonstrate the flexibility and accuracy of using maximum entropy flow networks.", "As machine learning continues to conquer new and formidable challenges on a daily basis, the vision of achieving general AI begins to seem within reach. Despite this, the bulk of current research is dedicated to pivotal yet specialized tasks like image classification and machine translation. We attribute this focus to the absence of objective metrics for tracking progress towards broad machine intelligence. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive set of criteria for general AI, along with a streamlined platform designed to evaluate machines on their ability to meet these criteria, minimizing any additional complexities.", "Neural networks designed to process graph structures are particularly suited for a range of tasks across different domains, such as natural language processing (e.g., parse trees) and cheminformatics (e.g., molecular graphs). Nevertheless, because each input results in a computation graph with a unique shape and size, these networks do not naturally accommodate batched training or inference. This also poses a challenge when implementing them in widely-used deep learning libraries that rely on static data-flow graphs. We introduce a method known as dynamic batching, which enables the batching of operations not only across various input graphs with different shapes but also across different nodes within a single graph. This approach allows the creation of static graphs that simulate dynamic computation graphs of any shape and size using popular deep learning libraries. Additionally, we present a high-level library containing compositional blocks, which simplifies the construction of dynamic graph models. Employing this library, we demonstrate concise, batch-wise parallel implementations for a variety of models from existing literature.", "Deep learning models have shown great success in natural language processing, but their decision-making processes remain largely opaque. Consequently, these models are often viewed as black boxes, offering little insight into the underlying patterns they learn. In this paper, we focus on Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTMs) and introduce a novel method for tracing the influence of a specific input on the LSTM\u2019s output. By pinpointing consistently crucial word patterns, we are able to distill cutting-edge LSTMs used for sentiment analysis and question answering into a collection of representative phrases. We then quantitatively validate this representation by using the extracted phrases to build a straightforward, rule-based classifier that approximates the LSTM\u2019s performance.", "Deep reinforcement learning has seen impressive results but struggles with sparse rewards and long horizons. To address this, we propose a framework that first learns useful skills in a pre-training environment and then uses these skills for faster learning in downstream tasks. Our approach combines intrinsic motivation and hierarchical methods, with skill learning guided by a single proxy reward needing minimal domain knowledge. A high-level policy is then trained on these skills, improving exploration and tackling sparse rewards. We use Stochastic Neural Networks with an information-theoretic regularizer for efficient pre-training. Experiments show this method effectively and sample-efficiently learns a wide range of skills, boosting learning performance across various downstream tasks.", "Deep generative models, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), have seen impressive success and are often studied independently as distinct paradigms. This paper aims to connect GANs and VAEs through a new formulation, interpreting sample generation in GANs as posterior inference. It reveals that GANs and VAEs minimize KL divergences of their respective posterior and inference distributions in opposite directions, extending the two learning phases of the classic wake-sleep algorithm. This unified view helps analyze various existing model variants and transfer techniques across research lines effectively. For instance, the importance weighting method from VAE literature is applied to improve GAN learning, and VAEs are enhanced with an adversarial mechanism using generated samples. Experiments demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of these transferred techniques.", "We address the challenge of detecting out-of-distribution images in neural networks and present ODIN, a straightforward and powerful method that doesn\u2019t require altering a pre-trained network. ODIN leverages temperature scaling and tiny input perturbations to distinguish between in-distribution and out-of-distribution images based on their softmax scores. Through various experiments, we demonstrate that ODIN works well with different network architectures and datasets, consistently outperforming standard methods by a significant margin. Notably, ODIN reduces the false positive rate from 34.7% to 4.3% on DenseNet when tested with the CIFAR-10 dataset, while maintaining a 95% true positive rate.", "We introduce a fresh approach for unsupervised learning of representations inspired by the infomax principle, tailored for large-scale neural networks. By leveraging an asymptotic approximation of Shannon's mutual information in extensive neural populations, we show that a promising initial estimate of the global information-theoretic optimum is achievable through a hierarchical infomax strategy. Building on this initial solution, we propose an effective gradient descent algorithm to derive representations from input datasets. This method is versatile, working with complete, overcomplete, and undercomplete bases. Our numerical experiments confirm the robustness and high efficiency of this approach in identifying key features from input datasets. Compared to existing methods, our algorithm stands out for its faster training speed and enhanced robustness in unsupervised representation learning. Additionally, this method can be seamlessly extended to both supervised and unsupervised models for training deep structural networks.", "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have consistently demonstrated exceptional performance in sequence modeling tasks. Nonetheless, training RNNs on extended sequences frequently encounters challenges such as slow inference, vanishing gradients, and difficulties in capturing long-term dependencies. These issues are closely tied to the expansive, sequential computational graph that arises from unfolding the RNN over time during backpropagation through time settings. We present the Skip RNN model, an enhancement of existing RNN models that learns to skip state updates, thereby reducing the effective size of the computational graph. Additionally, the model can be incentivized to perform fewer state updates through the implementation of a budget constraint. We evaluate the proposed model across various tasks, illustrating its capability to decrease the number of necessary RNN updates while maintaining, and in some cases enhancing, the performance of baseline RNN models. The source code is publicly accessible at https://imatge-upc.github.io/skiprnn-2017-telecombcn/.", "Restart techniques are commonly employed in gradient-free optimization to address multimodal functions. In gradient-based optimization, partial warm restarts have been gaining traction to enhance convergence rates within accelerated gradient schemes, specifically for ill-conditioned functions. In this paper, we introduce a straightforward warm restart technique for stochastic gradient descent aimed at improving its performance during deep neural network training. We conduct an empirical evaluation on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, achieving new state-of-the-art results of 3.14% and 16.21%, respectively. Additionally, we highlight the technique's efficacy on a dataset of EEG recordings and a downsampled version of the ImageNet dataset.

Nevertheless, they frequently encounter large variance issues in policy gradient estimation, resulting in poor sample efficiency during training. In this work, we introduce a control variate method to effectively reduce variance in policy gradient methods. Inspired by Stein's identity, our method enhances previous control variate techniques used in REINFORCE and advantage actor-critic by incorporating more general action-dependent baseline functions. Empirical studies demonstrate that our method substantially enhances the sample efficiency of leading policy gradient approaches.", "The introduction of skip connections has revolutionized the training of very deep neural networks, making it feasible and leading to their widespread adoption in various neural network architectures. Despite their success, a comprehensive explanation for why skip connections are so effective has remained unclear. In this work, we offer a new perspective on the benefits of skip connections when training deep networks.\n\nOne major challenge in training deep networks is the presence of singularities arising due to the model's non-identifiability. Previous research has identified several types of such singularities: \n\n1. Overlap singularities, which result from the nodes' permutation symmetry within a layer.\n2. Elimination singularities, which occur when nodes are consistently deactivated.\n3. Singularities caused by the linear dependence among nodes.\n\nThese singularities introduce degenerate manifolds in the loss landscape, impeding the learning process. We propose that skip connections mitigate these singularities by disrupting the permutation symmetry of nodes, reducing the likelihood of node elimination, and decreasing linear dependence among nodes. Additionally, typical initializations of networks with skip connections help to avoid these problematic singularities and reshape the loss landscape, thereby easing the learning slowdown.\n\nOur hypotheses are supported by evidence from both simplified models and experiments on deep networks trained with real-world datasets, demonstrating the efficacy of skip connections in overcoming these training difficulties.", "As part of the ICLR 2018 Reproducibility Challenge, we set out to replicate the findings from the paper \"Natural Language Inference over Interaction Space,\" which was submitted to the ICLR 2018 conference.

After some intense effort, we evaluated our handmade version of the model on the Stanford NLI dataset and achieved a respectable 86.38% accuracy on the test set. The original paper boasts an 88.0% accuracy, and we believe the gap stems from variations in optimizers and model selection techniques.", "We have successfully implemented the \"Learn to Pay Attention\" model for attention mechanisms in convolutional neural networks, replicating the original paper's results in both image classification and fine-grained recognition categories.", "Crafting universal distributed representations of sentences is a cornerstone of natural language processing.

Our experiments on popular architectures, including VGG-like and ResNets, demonstrate the effectiveness of Stochastic Batch Normalization on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.", "Many people think that deep convolutional networks are successful because they gradually filter out unimportant variations in the input data. This idea is backed by how hard it is to reconstruct images from their hidden layers in most common network setups. In this paper, we show that losing information isn't actually necessary to create representations that work well for complex tasks like ImageNet. We introduce the i-RevNet, a network built from a series of homeomorphic layers, which can be fully reversed up to the final class projection, meaning no information is lost. Building an invertible network is challenging partly because local inversion is tricky, but we solve this by providing an explicit inverse. Our analysis of i-RevNet's learned representations suggests that the success of deep networks could be due to a progressive tightening and linear separation with depth. To better understand the model learned by i-RevNet, we also reconstruct linear interpolations between natural image representations.", "Deep latent variable models serve as robust instruments for representation learning. In this paper, we adopt the deep information bottleneck model, identify its limitations, and propose an enhanced model that addresses these deficiencies. We incorporate a copula transformation to restore the invariance properties of the information bottleneck method, which facilitates the disentanglement of features in the latent space. Consequently, this transformation fosters sparsity within the latent space of the new model.

In recent years, numerous techniques have been proposed to enhance robustness against these adversarial examples. However, many of these methods quickly prove vulnerable to subsequent attacks. For instance, more than half of the defenses introduced in papers accepted at ICLR 2018 have already been compromised. To tackle this challenge, we propose using formal verification techniques. Our approach involves constructing provably minimally distorted adversarial examples: for any given neural network and input sample, we can generate adversarial examples with the least possible distortion. Utilizing this method, we demonstrate that a recent defense proposal from ICLR, known as adversarial retraining, effectively increases the distortion needed to produce adversarial examples by a factor of 4.2.", "Deep neural networks (DNNs) excel at predicting outcomes by learning intricate, non-linear relationships among variables. However, their complex nature makes these relationships hard to visualize, earning DNNs the label of \"black boxes\" and limiting their use. To address this issue, we present a method called agglomerative contextual decomposition (ACD) for explaining DNN predictions through hierarchical interpretations. ACD produces a hierarchical clustering of input features for a given DNN prediction, showing the contribution of each cluster to the final outcome. This hierarchy is designed to highlight feature clusters that the DNN identified as predictive. Through examples from the Stanford Sentiment Treebank and ImageNet, we demonstrate that ACD successfully diagnoses incorrect predictions and detects dataset biases. Human experiments show that ACD helps users discern the more accurate of two DNNs and increases trust in a DNN's outputs. Additionally, ACD's hierarchies are generally resistant to adversarial perturbations, suggesting they capture essential input characteristics while ignoring irrelevant noise.", "Imagine if you could wave a magic wand and transform the sound of a piano into a violin, all while keeping the same melody, rhythm, and volume. That's exactly what we're diving into with our work on musical timbre transfer. Instead of just changing the appearance of a photo using style transfer, we're shifting the \"color\" of sounds between different instruments.\n\nIntroducing TimbreTron: a groundbreaking method that takes the concept of style transfer from the visual world and brings it to music. By using a time-frequency representation of an audio signal, TimbreTron allows us to manipulate the timbre, or unique quality of sound, of an instrument.

Remarkably, these networks are free from troublesome local valleys. No matter where you start in the parameter space, there's always a continuous path where the cross-entropy loss consistently decreases, approaching zero. This groundbreaking discovery means that these networks are devoid of sub-optimal strict local minima.", "Visual Question Answering (VQA) models have historically struggled with counting objects in natural images. We have identified that the use of soft attention in these models is a fundamental issue contributing to this difficulty. To address this problem, we propose a neural network component that enhances the robustness of counting using object proposals. Our experiments on a toy task demonstrate the effectiveness of this component, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in the number category of the VQA v2 dataset without sacrificing performance in other categories.

Furthermore, tree-structured neural networks surpass LSTM RNNs due to their superior capability to leverage logical syntax, while PossibleWorldNets achieve the best performance across all benchmarks.", "Neural network pruning can reduce parameter counts by over 90%, decreasing storage needs and boosting inference performance without losing accuracy. However, pruned architectures are hard to train from scratch. We discover that standard pruning reveals subnetworks with initial weights that enable effective training. This leads to the \"lottery ticket hypothesis\": dense, randomly-initialized networks contain subnetworks (\"winning tickets\") that, when trained alone, achieve comparable test accuracy to the original network in a similar time. Winning tickets owe their success to advantageous initial weights. We provide an algorithm to identify these tickets and present experiments showing their importance. We consistently find winning tickets less than 10-20% the size of standard architectures (MNIST, CIFAR10). Beyond this size, these tickets train faster and achieve higher test accuracy than the original network.", "We describe the singular values of the linear transformation linked to a standard 2D multi-channel convolutional layer, allowing for their efficient calculation. This understanding also gives rise to an algorithm for projecting a convolutional layer onto an operator-norm ball.

This framework captures data distribution precisely, encourages disentangled representations, and aligns seamlessly with regularization methods such as Batch Norm. Built on a teacher-student architecture, the framework expands the student's forward and backward propagation into the teacher's computational graph. Crucially, it avoids impractical assumptions like Gaussian inputs or activation independence. Our framework promises to shed light on critical practical issues in deep network theory, including overfitting, generalization, and the nature of disentangled representations.", "We introduce Neural Program Search, an advanced algorithm designed to generate programs from natural language descriptions and a limited set of input/output examples.

Our experimental results, spanning synthetic data, feature imputation, and image inpainting, highlight the model's remarkable effectiveness and the vibrant diversity of its generated samples.", "Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) were initially inspired by Kingma & Welling (2014) as probabilistic generative frameworks utilizing approximate Bayesian inference. The concept of $\\beta$-VAEs introduced by Higgins et al. (2017) diverges from this original interpretation and broadens the application spectrum of VAEs to various fields such as representation learning, clustering, and lossy data compression. This is achieved through an objective function that enables users to balance the information content (\"bit rate\") of the latent representation against the distortion of the reconstructed data (Alemi et al., 2018). In this study, we re-evaluate this rate/distortion trade-off in the scope of hierarchical VAEs, which incorporate multiple layers of latent variables. We recognize a general category of inference models allowing the rate to be divided into contributions from each layer, enabling individual tuning. We establish theoretical limits on the efficacy of downstream tasks based on the rates of individual layers and confirm these theoretical insights through extensive experiments. Our findings offer useful recommendations for practitioners on selecting the optimal rate-space region for specific applications.", "Exploring the intricate landscapes of adversarial examples reveals much about the resilience of deep neural networks (DNNs) against subtle perturbations. In a groundbreaking study, Ma et al. (ICLR 2018) introduced the concept of local intrinsic dimensionality (LID) within layer-wise hidden representations of DNNs to delve into these adversarial realms. Demonstrating prowess, LID effectively mapped the subspaces influenced by various attack strategies, such as the Carlini and Wagner (C&W) attack and the fast gradient sign attack.\n\nVenturing further, this paper presents novel experimental insights using the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, exposing some limitations of LID in portraying adversarial subspaces. These explorations focus on two previously uncharted territories in LID analysis: (i) oblivious attacks intertwined with varying confidence levels of adversarial examples and (ii) the nuances of black-box transfer attacks.\n\nRegarding (i), our findings reveal that the efficacy of LID is remarkably sensitive to the attack\u2019s confidence parameter. Surprisingly, when adversarial examples with mixed confidence levels are analyzed, LID underperforms. In the case of (ii), we observe that adversarial examples generated from alternative DNN models elude effective characterization by LID.\n\nCollectively, these discoveries underscore significant constraints in LID's ability to map out adversarial subspaces, suggesting that its application might be more limited than previously anticipated.", "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a buzzword in the generative modeling field, renowned for their ability to create strikingly realistic samples. Despite their potential, they present a notorious challenge: they\u2019re a bear to train. The regular approach has been to tweak the GAN objective in various innovative ways, but surprisingly little attention has been paid to optimizing the adversarial training itself. Our research reinterprets GAN optimization problems through the lens of variational inequalities. By diving into mathematical programming, we debunk some myths about the challenges of saddle point optimization. We suggest enhancing GAN training by adapting methods from the variational inequalities domain. Specifically, we bring averaging, extrapolation, and a less resource-intensive adaptation called extrapolation from the past, to both SGD and Adam optimization techniques.", "Neural message passing algorithms for semi-supervised classification on graphs have recently revolutionized the field. Yet, their limitation lies in considering only a small, difficult-to-expand neighborhood for node classification. Our breakthrough research addresses this constraint by leveraging the relationship between graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and PageRank to create a superior propagation scheme based on personalized PageRank. This innovative approach forms the basis of our simple yet powerful model, personalized propagation of neural predictions (PPNP), and its efficient variant, APPNP. Remarkably, our model boasts training times that are on par with or faster than existing models, with a comparable or even lower number of parameters. By harnessing a significantly larger, adjustable neighborhood for classification, our model seamlessly integrates with any neural network. Extensive studies demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms recently proposed methods for semi-supervised classification, establishing a new benchmark in the field. Our implementation is readily accessible online.", "In our research, we uncover the phenomenon of obfuscated gradients, a type of gradient masking, which can lead to a misleading perception of security in defense mechanisms against adversarial examples. Defenses that create obfuscated gradients may seem effective against iterative optimization-based attacks at first glance, but further investigation reveals that these defenses can be bypassed. We document the characteristic behaviors of defenses that exhibit this phenomenon and classify three types of obfuscated gradients. For each type, we develop specific attack techniques to overcome the defense. In a case study focused on non-certified white-box-secure defenses presented at the ICLR 2018 conference, we observe that obfuscated gradients are prevalent, with 7 out of 9 defenses relying on this effect. Our newly devised attack strategies successfully defeat 6 defenses entirely and partially undermine 1, all within the original threat models proposed in the respective papers.", "Techniques for learning node representations in graphs are pivotal in network analysis as they facilitate various downstream tasks. We introduce Graph2Gauss, an efficient method for learning flexible node embeddings on large-scale (attributed) graphs, demonstrating robust performance in tasks such as link prediction and node classification. Unlike most methods that represent nodes as point vectors in a low-dimensional space, we represent each node as a Gaussian distribution, thus capturing representation uncertainty. Additionally, we present an unsupervised method suitable for inductive learning scenarios across diverse graph types: plain/attributed and directed/undirected. By integrating both network structure and node attributes, we can generalize to unseen nodes without requiring extra training. To learn embeddings, we use a personalized ranking approach concerning node distances that takes advantage of the inherent ordering imposed by the network structure. Our experiments on real-world networks highlight the superior performance of our method, surpassing state-of-the-art network embedding techniques across various tasks. Moreover, modeling uncertainty provides additional insights by allowing us to estimate neighborhood diversity and identify the inherent latent dimensionality of a graph.", "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the preferred approach for solving problems involving 2D planar images. However, recent advancements have highlighted the need for models capable of analyzing spherical images. Such applications include omnidirectional vision for drones, robots, and autonomous vehicles, as well as molecular regression issues and global weather and climate modeling. A straightforward application of convolutional networks to a planar projection of a spherical signal is likely to fail due to space-varying distortions introduced by the projection, which render translational weight sharing ineffective.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce essential components for constructing spherical CNNs. We propose a definition for spherical cross-correlation that is both expressive and rotation-equivariant. This spherical correlation adheres to a generalized Fourier theorem, enabling efficient computation using a generalized (non-commutative) Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. We demonstrate the computational efficiency, numerical accuracy, and effectiveness of spherical CNNs in 3D model recognition and atomization energy regression tasks.", "This paper demonstrates the direct application of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classification problems in cheminformatics.

Both methods enable us to train large LSTM networks much faster, achieving nearly state-of-the-art perplexity while utilizing significantly fewer parameters.", "Cutting-edge models for deep reading comprehension are primarily led by recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Due to their inherently sequential processing ability, RNNs are well-suited for interpreting language. However, this sequential nature restricts parallel processing within a single instance, often creating a significant bottleneck when deploying these models in situations where low latency is critical. This limitation is especially pronounced when dealing with longer texts.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce a convolutional architecture as an alternative approach to these recurrent architectures. By replacing the recurrent units with straightforward dilated convolutional units, we are able to achieve performance levels on par with the state-of-the-art across two question answering benchmarks. Moreover, this convolutional approach yields substantial improvements in speed, offering up to two orders of magnitude faster processing times for question answering tasks.", "In this study, we examine the reinstatement mechanism proposed by Ritter et al. (2018) and identify two types of neurons that develop in the agent's working memory (an epLSTM cell) when it undergoes episodic meta-RL training on an episodic form of the Harlow visual fixation task. The Abstract neurons store knowledge common across various tasks, while the Episodic neurons hold information pertinent to the task of a particular episode.", "The concept of the rate-distortion-perception function (RDPF), introduced by Blau and Michaeli in 2019, has become an invaluable framework for analyzing the balance between realism and distortion in lossy compression. While the rate-distortion function is well-understood, the existence of encoders and decoders that can match the rates predicted by the RDPF has remained a mystery. Leveraging findings from Li and El Gamal in 2018, we demonstrate that it is indeed possible to achieve the RDPF using stochastic, variable-length codes. Moreover, we establish that for these types of codes, the RDPF sets a lower bound on the achievable rate, pushing the boundaries of what we know about efficient data compression and perception.", "Hey there! In this paper, we introduce Neural Phrase-based Machine Translation (NPMT). Our approach specifically models phrase structures in output sequences using Sleep-WAke Networks (SWAN), a cool new segmentation-based sequence modeling method. To get around SWAN's strict alignment rules, we added a new layer that allows for (soft) local reordering of input sequences. Unlike other neural machine translation (NMT) methods, NPMT skips the attention-based decoding and instead outputs phrases in a straightforward order, which makes decoding faster. Our tests show that NPMT knocks it out of the park on IWSLT 2014 German-English/English-German and IWSLT 2015 English-Vietnamese translation tasks, beating strong NMT benchmarks. Plus, we noticed our method produces meaningful phrases in the output languages.", "It is well-established that minor adversarial perturbations can cause classification errors in deep neural networks (DNNs). This paper argues that sparse representations of input data are essential for mitigating such attacks. For linear classifiers, we demonstrate that a sparsifying front end is provably effective against $\\ell_{\\infty}$-bounded attacks, reducing output distortion induced by the attack by a factor of approximately $K / N$, where $N$ represents the data dimension and $K$ denotes the sparsity level. We extend this approach to DNNs by proposing a \"locally linear\" model that serves as a theoretical basis for developing both attacks and defenses. Experimental results on the MNIST dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed sparsifying front end.", "Get ready for a game-changer in deep reinforcement learning!
