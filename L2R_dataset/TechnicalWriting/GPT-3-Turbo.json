["Process calculi based on logic, such as $\\pi$DILL and CP, form the cornerstone for achieving deadlock-free concurrent programming. In previous studies, an issue arose due to a discrepancy between proof construction rules and the term constructors of the $\\pi$-calculus, notably the lack of correspondence between the fundamental operator for parallel composition and any linear logic rule. To address this gap, Kokke et al. (2019) introduced Hypersequent Classical Processes (HCP), utilizing hypersequents to capture parallelism in typing judgements. However, transitioning from CP to HCP is a significant leap, as HCP currently lacks reduction semantics and exhibits differences in behavior due to delayed actions. In response, we propose HCP-, a refined version of HCP with reduction semantics and without delayed actions. We demonstrate the soundness of HCP- through progress, preservation, and termination proofs, establishing its compatibility with the same communication protocols as CP.", "An alternative version of the BDDC preconditioner is proposed, where constraints are enforced on a specific set of substructures (subdomain subedges, subfaces, and vertices between pairs of subedges). The preconditioner's condition number is demonstrated to be bounded by $C \\big(1+\\log (L/h)\\big)^2$, with $C$ being a constant, and $h$ and $L$ representing the characteristic sizes of the mesh and the substructures, respectively. Since $L$ can be selected quite flexibly, the condition number theoretically can become as small as $O(1). We will examine both the advantages and disadvantages of this preconditioner, along with its utility in addressing heterogeneous problems. Additionally, numerical findings obtained from supercomputers will be presented.", "We describe cases where the Heun function serves as a solution to certain wave equations in general relativity. For instance, in four dimensions, the Dirac equation in the Nutku helicoid metric has Mathieu functions as solutions. Moving to five dimensions, the solution becomes the double confluent Heun function, which can be simplified to the Mathieu function through certain changes. To address the singularity at the origin in the metric, we apply Atiyah-Patodi-Singer spectral boundary conditions.", "Many authors have shown that a gradual decrease in X-rays seen in long-duration flares can be explained by continuous magnetic reconnection and energy release in the flare's coronal region. With the help of RHESSI data, we aim to understand how effective these processes are during the decay phase of long-duration flares and how to accurately calculate the energy release rate using this data. We reconstructed images of selected long-duration flares during their decay phase to analyze the physical characteristics of the flare's coronal sources. By examining the energy equation terms, we can determine the accuracy of the calculation for each term.", "We use a multi-scale analysis to explain the typical geometric arrangement of clusters under the FK measure in random media. Our findings are valid in dimensions equal to or greater than 2, assuming slab percolation happens under the averaged measure, which is expected in the entire supercritical phase. This study expands on Pisztora's work and offers a key tool for analyzing the supercritical phase in disordered FK models, as well as in the related disordered Ising and Potts models.", "The absorption lines in classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) exhibit relatively low intensity compared to normal stars. This phenomenon, known as veiling, typically signifies the presence of excess continuous emission originating from shock-heated gas at the stellar surface beneath the accretion streams. Our investigation focuses on four stars (RW Aur A, RU Lup, S CrA NW, and S CrA SE) with particularly strong veiling levels in order to analyze the relationship between veiling, stellar brightness, and emission line strengths, juxtaposed against standard accretion models. Through continuous photometric and spectroscopic monitoring at various time points, we observe that changes in the accretion rate lead to variable levels of excess emission, consequently impacting stellar brightness. Surprisingly, we discover that the veiling of absorption lines in these stars fluctuates significantly, often reaching values that suggest the release of multiple stellar luminosities worth of potential energy. Notably, in instances of extreme line dilution, the derived veiling factors exhibit a weak correlation with brightness. Furthermore, the emission line intensities defy the anticipated trend of veiling relative to line strength. Our findings reveal drastic fluctuations in veiling within a single night, independent of the phase of rotation periods in two stars. Particularly intriguing is the observation that high veiling levels in three stars lead to the filling of photospheric lines by line emission, resulting in substantial veiling factors unrelated to changes in continuous emission from shocked regions. We also explore the extent to which dust extinction and electron scattering in the accretion stream might influence veiling measurements in CTTS. Ultimately, we deduce that veiling levels cannot serve as a reliable indicator of accretion rates in CTTS featuring rich emission line spectra.", "Hey there! So, we checked out these two cool galaxies, Malin 1 and NGC 7589, known as Giant Low Surface Brightness (GLSB) galaxies. People used to think they were big, dark matter-heavy systems, but our new study dives into the details. We took a fresh look at their rotation curves, and guess what? Turns out they show some unexpected features! Instead of the usual slow rise, the central parts have a sharp increase more like what you find in high surface brightness (HSB) systems. By looking at how the luminous and dark matter are spread out in these galaxies, we found that the baryons might actually rule the roost in the inner areas. The stars-to-light ratios we got are pretty standard for HSB galaxies, which is interesting. This all hints that GLSB galaxies might have a split personality: with a bright, spiral inner core and a more spread-out dim disk around it. We even checked out MOND, a theory in cosmology, and found that it works well for NGC 7589 but struggles a bit with Malin 1. Science can be full of surprises!", "The study investigates the multiplicity distribution, multiplicity moment, scaled variance, entropy, and reduced entropy of target evaporated fragments emitted in forward and backward hemispheres for different heavy ion interactions. Results show that the multiplicity distribution can be described by a Gaussian distribution. The multiplicity moments increase with the order of the moment, with the second-order moment being energy independent. The scaled variance indicates weak correlation among the produced particles, while the entropy values are consistent within experimental errors.", "We theoretically study how a quantum dot behaves over time when subjected to off-resonant optical excitation aimed at quickly preparing a state with the help of acoustic phonons. We find that during a preparation process with short laser pulses, three key processes occur: state dressing when the laser pulse turns on, relaxation induced by phonons, and state undressing when the pulse ends. Our analysis of different pulse shapes reveals that the final state in short pulse protocols is significantly influenced by an adiabatic undressing. Additionally, we demonstrate that in systems with excitons and biexcitons, parameters such as pulse detuning, pulse duration, and biexciton binding energy can be adjusted to target a specific quantum dot state.", "In quantum mechanics, the probabilistic interpretation was added later due to experimental evidence and is not inherent in the mathematical model. A more straightforward approach is provided by quantum logics with unique conditional probabilities, where probability conditionalization aligns with state transition in the measurement process. This leads to defining five compatibility and comeasurability levels, indicating absence of interference, joint distribution existence, measurability simultaneity, and independence of final state from measurement order. Another level signifies elements belonging to the same Boolean subalgebra. While these levels may vary, they align in Hilbert space formalism, von Neumann algebras, and certain cases.", "This analysis explores how wave-vector dispersion in elliptically birefringent stratified magneto-optic media with one-dimensional periodicity is affected by differences in local normal-mode polarization states between adjacent layers. These differences lead to mode coupling, influencing the wave-vector dispersion and Bloch states of the system. The coupling introduces additional terms in the dispersion relation that are not observed in uniform circularly birefringent media. It also lifts degeneracy at frequency band crossover points and creates a magnetization-dependent optical band gap. The study investigates the conditions for band gap formation, revealing that the frequency-split can be described by a coupling parameter based on the relationship between polarization states of local normal modes in adjacent layers. The analysis also examines the Bloch states' characteristics and identifies conditions for maximizing band splitting strength in these systems.", "We investigate an expanded variant of classical empirical risk minimization, wherein the hypothesis space is a random subspace within a predetermined space. Specifically, we contemplate potentially data-dependent subspaces formed by a random subset of the data, representing, in a special instance, Nystr\\\"om methodologies for kernel techniques. The exploration of random subspaces inherently offers computational advantages; nevertheless, it raises the query regarding potential degradation in learning accuracy. Recently, the assessment of these statistical-computational trade-offs has been a subject of scrutiny for the least squares loss and self-concordant loss functions, such as the logistic loss.\n\nIn this discourse, our aim is to extend these deliberations to encompass convex Lipschitz loss functions, that may lack smoothness, such as the hinge loss utilized in support vector machines. Such an expansion necessitates the formulation of fresh proofs reliant on divergent technical apparatus. Our primary outcomes underscore the presence of distinct configurations, contingent on the complexity of the learning task, where computational efficiency can be bolstered without compromising performance. Empirical underpinnings of our theoretical findings are elucidated through rudimentary numerical experiments.", "The concept of a patient's agreement is crucial for allowing access to medical information. In most traditional healthcare systems, consent is obtained through a form that the patient fills out and signs. However, in electronic health systems, paper-based consent forms are being replaced by incorporating consent mechanisms directly into the regulation of access to medical data. This approach gives patients more power to grant or withdraw consent effectively. The process of giving and revoking consent can vary depending on the patient's circumstances. We argue that capturing such detailed information through a set of authorization policies can be challenging and prone to errors. In this paper, we introduce ACTORS, a goal-oriented method for managing consent. ACTORS uses a goal-driven approach inspired by Teleo-Reactive programming to handle consent, considering changes in the domains and contexts in which the patient provides consent.", "This study focuses on analyzing the inverse random source problem for the time fractional diffusion equation where the source is driven by a fractional Brownian motion. It involves studying the stochastic time fractional diffusion equation given a random source. The goal is to determine the statistical properties of the source using the expectation and variance of the final time data. The direct problem is shown to be well-posed with a unique mild solution under specific conditions. In the inverse problem, uniqueness is established, and instability is characterized. The analysis relies heavily on the properties of the Mittag--Leffler function and stochastic integrals related to the fractional Brownian motion.", "Manifold learning methods are key players in reducing dimensions and handling high-dimensional data sets effectively. Most of these methods are graph-based, where each data point is linked with a vertex and each pair is connected with a weighted edge. We know from existing theory that the Laplacian matrix of the graph tends to converge to the Laplace-Beltrami operator of the data manifold, with the assumption that pairwise affinities rely on the Euclidean norm. In our study, we explore the limiting differential operator for graph Laplacians formed using $\\textit{any}$ norm. Our proof involves a blend of the manifold's second fundamental form and the convex geometry of the unit ball associated with the norm. We showcase the advantages of non-Euclidean norms in manifold learning by examining how they aid in mapping the motion of large molecules with continuous variations. Through a numerical simulation, we illustrate that an adapted Laplacian eigenmaps algorithm, based on the Earthmover's distance, surpasses the classic Euclidean Laplacian eigenmaps in terms of computational efficiency and the necessary sample size to capture the intrinsic geometry.", "We offer an efficient integral equation method for solving the heat equation in a two-dimensional, multiply connected domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Rather than utilizing integral equations based on the heat kernel, we start by discretizing in time. This leads to a non-homogeneous modified Helmholtz equation solved at each time increment. The solution involves a volume potential combined with a double layer potential. We efficiently evaluate the volume potential using a fast multipole-accelerated solver. We then satisfy the boundary conditions by addressing an integral equation associated with the homogeneous modified Helmholtz equation. The integral equation solver is expedited using the fast multipole method (FMM). With a total of $N$ points in the boundary and domain discretization, the computational cost per time step is either $O(N)$ or $O(N\\log N)$.", "We explore a method involving consecutive state-discrimination measurements on qudits, aiming to unveil the quantum state of their initial configuration. These qudits are part of a collection of non-orthogonal quantum states, posing a challenge in definitive distinction. The method of unambiguous state discrimination facilitates precise measurements but may lead to occasional inconclusive outcomes regarding the qudit's state. In contrast to qubits, qudits offer higher information capacity per transmission. Our analysis involves scenarios where Alice transmits one of N qudits, each having a dimension of N as well. Two situations are considered: one with identical state overlaps and another where qudits are split into two groups with varied overlaps. Additionally, we examine the resilience of our approach against basic eavesdropping attempts. Notably, employing qudits improves error detection against potential eavesdroppers compared to qubits.", "This work enhances access control in Hyperledger Fabric blockchain by combining various IDs, attributes, and policies. The existing access control system of Hyperledger Fabric is analyzed, and a new implementation is proposed to make access control decisions easier for users and developers. The new approach utilizes the Fabric CA client to simplify the process of registering and enrolling certificates for new users. The research demonstrates that combining multiple IDs, attributes, and policies using Hyperledger Fabric's smart contracts is feasible without significant performance impact compared to unrestricted access control.", "This paper introduces Pyramidal Convolution (PyConv), a novel approach capable of handling input data at multiple filter scales efficiently. PyConv features a pyramid of kernels with varying sizes and depths at each level, allowing it to capture diverse details within an image. In addition to its enhanced recognition capacities, PyConv is also highly resourceful - it preserves computational efficiency and parameter count compared to standard convolutional methods. This flexibility enables the construction of various network architectures suitable for a wide range of applications in computer vision tasks. PyConv shows promise in revolutionizing the field of visual recognition, as demonstrated by the superior performance of PyConv-based architectures across tasks such as image classification, video action recognition, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Notably, our 50-layer PyConv network surpasses the performance of a 152-layer ResNet on ImageNet data using significantly fewer parameters, lower computational complexity, and fewer layers. Our novel image segmentation framework further establishes a new benchmark on the challenging ADE20K dataset. For those interested, the code can be found at: https://github.com/iduta/pyconv", "The presentation will cover the latest updates on the search for solar axions at the CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST). Results from the initial stage of CAST phase II, focusing on scanning axion masses up to 0.4 eV by introducing 4He gas into the magnet bores at varying pressures, will be shared. By observing no surplus X-rays while the magnet was aligned with the Sun, an upper limit on the axion-photon coupling of g < 2.17 x 10^10 GeV$-1 at 95% confidence level has been established for axion masses below 0.4 eV, with the exact value dependent on the pressure settings. The ongoing investigation in the second part of CAST phase II involves the search for axions with masses of up to approximately 1.2 eV using 3He as a buffer gas, for which the expected sensitivities will be discussed. In addition, the presentation will touch upon upcoming developments and potential future directions for a new helioscope experiment.", "Observations show Arctic sea ice is rapidly decreasing while Antarctic sea ice is expanding. Climate models generally predict moderate decreases in both regions. Some models match observed trends when accounting for internal variability. We analyzed simulations from CMIP5 and CESM-LE, finding that models with Arctic ice retreat matching observations have more warming than observed. These models do not align with actual observations. In the Antarctic, models with ice expansion similar to observations often have too little warming. Thus, models fail to capture the observed polar sea ice trends accurately.", "Bio-features are increasingly crucial for authenticating IoT devices. This study aims to identify barriers to the development and implementation of biometric models on a large scale. Factors include human physical (such as face, eyes, fingerprints, palm, or electrocardiogram) and behavioral features (like signature, voice, gait, or keystroke). The research delves into various machine learning and data mining techniques used in authentication schemes for mobile IoT devices. It also discusses threat models and countermeasures applied in biometrics-based authentication systems for mobile IoT devices. The paper examines the current landscape of biometric-based authentication schemes for IoT devices and highlights challenges for future research in this field.", "Hey there! Device fingerprinting on the web has been getting a lot of attention lately, both from the research community and the commercial world. Up until now, most fingerprinting methods have relied on software installed on the device. But here's the thing - users can easily change or remove these software-based features, making them less reliable.\n\nIn our position paper, we make the case that with the advent of the HTML5 standard, a new breed of fingerprinting features based on the device's hardware is emerging. Unlike software-based features, these hardware-based features are much trickier to hide or alter, offering a more dependable fingerprint.\n\nWe put forward some potential methods for using HTML5 to identify a device's hardware and even conducted a preliminary experiment to fingerprint a device's GPU. Exciting stuff!", "We express the partition function of Chern-Simons theory with the exceptional gauge group on a three-sphere in terms of the refined closed topological string. The relation between the K\\\"ahler parameter $\\tau$, string coupling constant $g_s$, and refinement parameter $b$ is given by $2\\tau=g_s(1-b)$ for $G_2, F_4, E_6, E_7, E_8$ with $b=\\frac{5}{3},\\frac{5}{2},3,4,6$ respectively. The non-zero BPS invariants $N^d_{J_L,J_R}$ are $N^2_{0,\\frac{1}{2}}=1$ and $N^{11}_{0,1}=1$. Additionally, the partition function contains the term corresponding to the refined constant maps of string theory. The derivation is based on the universal form of the Chern-Simons partition function on a three-sphere, restricted to the exceptional line $Exc$ with Vogel's parameters satisfying $\\gamma=2(\\alpha+\\beta)$, and the same results are obtained for the $F$ line, where $\\gamma=\\alpha+\\beta$, with non-zero $N^2_{0,\\frac{1}{2}}=1$ and $N^{7}_{0,1}=1$. The refinement parameter $b$ is expressed as $b=-\\beta/\\alpha$ in terms of universal parameters restricted to the line.", "The centerpoint theorem is a fundamental concept in discrete geometry that is widely employed. It asserts that for any collection $P$ of $n$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, there exists a point $c$, which may not belong to $P, such that every halfspace encompassing $c$ contains at least $\\frac{n}{d+1}$ points from $P$. This special point $c$ is known as a centerpoint, serving as a higher-dimensional analog of a median. Essentially, a centerpoint acts as a valuable representation of the point set $P$. However, considering the possibility of having multiple representatives, akin to selecting quantiles in one-dimensional datasets, we propose extending the concept of quantiles to higher dimensions. The objective is to identify a small set $Q$ of points where each halfspace enclosing a point from $Q$ contains a substantial portion of the points from $P, and those including more points from $Q$ encompass an even larger fraction of $P$. This scenario is akin to well-established notions such as weak $\\varepsilon$-nets and weak $\\varepsilon$-approximations, representing a concept stronger than the former yet weaker than the latter.", "We've created a new software called \\textsc{PsrPopPy} to simulate pulsar populations, building off the original \\textsc{Psrpop} package. We've revamped the code with Python, keeping some Fortran libraries, and taking advantage of Python's object-oriented features for better code organization. We've included ready-to-run scripts for standard simulations, but you can easily customize scripts to your needs. Adding new features, like different period or luminosity models, is now simpler due to the modular design compared to the old code. We've also explored enhancing the software's modeling capabilities. In our tests, we fitted pulsar spectral indices to a normal distribution with mean $-1.4$ and standard deviation $1.0$ using survey data at various frequencies. Additionally, we analyzed pulsar spin evolution to determine the best-fit relationship between luminosity and spin parameters. By replicating Faucher-Giguere & Kaspi's analysis, we fine-tuned the power-law relation between radio luminosity $L$, period $P$, and period derivative $\\dot{P}$. We found that $L \\propto P^{-1.39 \\pm 0.09} \\dot{P}^{0.48 \\pm 0.04}$ best describes the pulsar population and matches what Perera et al. found for $\\gamma$-ray pulsars. We used this relation to model a population and studied the age-luminosity trend for all pulsars, which could be measured in upcoming large-scale surveys with the Square Kilometer Array.", "We investigate the interaction between a collection of spins and a single-mode resonator under the influence of external pulses. Damped Rabi oscillations occur when the average spin frequency aligns with the cavity mode, illustrating the interplay between the spin ensemble and cavity despite dephasing due to spin broadening. Understanding the effects of this broadening is essential for a comprehensive grasp of the spin-cavity dynamics. By exploiting specific resonance conditions, we amplify coherent oscillations between the spin ensemble and cavity significantly. Our theoretical model is validated through an experiment involving NV centers in diamond coupled to a superconducting waveguide resonator.", "We study the ground-state Riemannian metric and cyclic quantum distance of an inhomogeneous quantum Ising spin-1/2 chain in a transverse field. This model is diagonalized using a canonical transformation to the fermionic Hamiltonian derived from the spin system. The ground-state Riemannian metric is exact on a parameter manifold ring $S^1$ obtained by a gauge transformation to the spin Hamiltonian through a twist operator. We analyze the ground-state cyclic quantum distance and the second derivative of the ground-state energy in different inhomogeneous exchange coupling regions. Specifically, we demonstrate that the quantum ferromagnetic phase in the uniform Ising chain is identified by an invariant cyclic quantum distance with a constant ground-state Riemannian metric, which diminishes rapidly to zero in the paramagnetic phase.", "Rotation measure synthesis is a crucial technique for estimating Faraday dispersion in cosmic magnetic fields. It involves using a Fourier transform to analyze the rotation of polarized light and is analogous to one-dimensional interferometric intensity measurements, although in a different Fourier space. By applying concepts from two-dimensional intensity interferometry, we can address various instrumental conditions when studying Faraday dispersion. Specifically, we demonstrate how to account for channel averaging effects during Faraday reconstruction, which has previously limited progress in polarimetric science using wide-band measurements. Through simulations of sparse reconstruction with channel averaging across realistic frequency ranges, we show that it is possible to detect signals with high rotation measure values that were previously overlooked, especially in low-frequency and wide-band polarimetry. Additionally, we propose integrating mosaicking in Faraday depth with channel averaging to enhance the analysis process. These advances establish a comprehensive framework for wide-band rotation measure synthesis, enabling the integration of data from multiple telescopes to enhance the quality and quantity of polarimetric science. This framework is particularly valuable for studying extreme environments with strong magnetic fields, such as those associated with pulsars and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), and will facilitate their use as precise probes of cosmological magnetic fields.", "The study investigates charged particle production in high-energy hadron-nucleus collisions using different statistical models such as the Negative Binomial, shifted Gompertz, Weibull, and Krasznovszky-Wagner distributions. These models, based on phenomenological parameterizations or underlying dynamics, are compared for their success in predicting outcomes. Some models have been applied to data from the LHC for both proton-proton and nucleus-nucleus collisions, analyzing various physical and derived observables.", "In 1975, John Tukey introduced the concept of multivariate median as the deepest point in a data cloud in R^d. David Donoho and Miriam Gasko later developed the idea of measuring a point's depth with respect to data using hyperplanes, leading to fruitful statistical methodology based on data depth and nonparametric statistics. Various notions of data depth have been introduced, each with different properties suited for specific applications. Depth statistics provide set-valued statistics describing distribution properties such as location, scale, and shape. The concept has been extended from empirical distributions to general probability distributions and from d-variate data to data in functional spaces, enabling consistency results and applications to various data types.", "The design of optoelectronic devices at the nanoscale relies heavily on strain-engineering in SiGe nanostructures. A new strategy is explored here, where SiGe structures are laterally confined by the Si substrate to achieve high tensile strain without external stressors, enhancing scalability. Spectro-microscopy techniques, simulations, and ab initio calculations are used to analyze the strain state of laterally confined Ge-rich SiGe nano-stripes. Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy reveals a large tensile hydrostatic strain component at the nano-stripe surface, originating from lateral confinement by substrate side walls and plastic relaxation of misfit strain at the SiGe/Si interface. Work function mapping shows a positive shift in work function at the stripe surface, indicating significant tensile lattice deformation. These findings are crucial for the development of nanoscale optoelectronic devices.", "\"In the midst of an infectious disease pandemic, it is absolutely crucial to actively exchange electronic medical records and utilize models derived from these records across different regions! When trying to apply data or models from one region to another, we often encounter distribution shift challenges that challenge the traditional machine learning approaches. But fear not! Transfer learning is here to save the day!\n\nWe dove headfirst into the world of infectious disease detection tasks by unleashing the power of deep transfer learning algorithms. Armed with domain adversarial neural networks and maximum classifier discrepancy algorithms, we set out to conquer the realm of transferring knowledge between regions. Our journey led us to explore well-crafted synthetic scenarios to fully understand data distribution distinctions between regions.\n\nOur scientific escapades revealed that transfer learning shines brightest in two key situations. Firstly, when the source and target regions are similar and the training data in the target region is scanty, transfer learning steps in as a valuable ally. Secondly, transfer learning proves its worth when dealing with target training data devoid of labels. In the case of similar regions with limited data, model-based transfer learning emerges as a powerful contender, matching the performance of data-based transfer learning models.\n\nNonetheless, our adventure does not end here! Further exploration is paramount to grasp the nuances of domain shift in real-world research data and address any performance dips that may arise. So, onwards we go, uncovering new solutions in the ever-evolving landscape of infectious disease classification!\"", "Bound states in the continuum (BIC) have been a major focus of research in optics and photonics in recent years. One area of interest is the study of quasi-BICs in simple structures, such as dielectric cylinders, where quasi-BICs are prominently observed. Research has explored quasi-BICs in both single cylinders and structures made up of cylinders. This study examines the properties of quasi-BICs in the transition from a uniform dielectric cylinder in air to a ring with narrow walls by gradually increasing the diameter of the inner air cylinder. The findings illustrate the transition of quasi-BICs from the strong-coupling regime to the weak-coupling regime, showing a shift from avoided crossing of branches to their intersection, with the quasi-BIC preserved on a single straight branch. In the strong-coupling and quasi-BIC regime, three waves interfere in the far-field zone: two waves associated with the resonant modes of the structure and a wave scattered by the entire structure. The discussion includes the relevance of the Fano resonance concept, which explains the interference of two waves under weak coupling conditions.", "Turbulent thermal diffusion is a phenomenon resulting from a combination of temperature-stratified turbulence and the inertia of small particles. It leads to the emergence of a non-diffusive turbulent flux of particles aligned with the turbulent heat flux. This flux is directly related to the average particle density and the effective velocity of inertial particles. Previous research had only explored this effect under conditions of low temperature gradients and small Stokes numbers (Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 76}, 224, 1996). This study introduces a generalized theory of turbulent thermal diffusion that applies to varying temperature gradients and Stokes numbers. To validate this theory in strongly stratified turbulent flows, laboratory experiments were conducted using oscillating grid turbulence and multi-fan turbulence. The findings revealed that, at high Reynolds numbers, the ratio of effective particle velocity to the vertical turbulent velocity is under 1. The effective velocity and coefficient of turbulent thermal diffusion increase with Stokes numbers until they peak at low values and decline for higher Stokes numbers. Additionally, the effective coefficient decreases as the mean temperature gradient increases. The experimental results align well with the developed theory.", "A conventional model concerning the visibility of pulsar radio emission relies on the premise that the emission is contained within a narrow cone surrounding the tangent to a dipolar field line. The widely acknowledged Rotating Vector Model (RVM) serves as an approximation where the line of sight remains constant, although not strictly tangent to the field line. A more precise treatment, as introduced by Gangadhara in 2004, is denoted as the Tangent Model. In the Tangent Model, unlike the RVM, the visible point varies with the pulsar's rotational phase, denoted as $\\psi$, thus tracing a path on a sphere with a radius of $r$. We calculate this trajectory and the angular velocity of the visible point's movement along it. It has been brought to our attention that recent research indicates the detectability of this motion through interstellar holography, proposed by Pen et al. in 2014. An assessment of errors stemming from the usage of the RVM reveals its significance, particularly for pulsars exhibiting emission across a broad spectrum of $\\psi$. The RVM tends to underestimate the extent of $\\psi$ within which emission remains observable. We contend that the geometric considerations heavily lean towards the emission of visible pulsar radio waves occurring at altitudes exceeding ten percent of the light-cylinder distance, whereby our disregard of retardation effects gains relevance.", "In the field of image recognition, it is common for training data to not include samples from all possible classes. Zero-shot learning (ZSL) addresses this issue by using class semantic information to classify samples of categories that were not seen during training. This paper introduces a new end-to-end framework called the Global Semantic Consistency Network (GSC-Net) that leverages semantic information from both seen and unseen classes, enabling effective zero-shot learning. Additionally, a soft label embedding loss is utilized to capture semantic relationships among classes. To make GSC-Net more practical for Generalized Zero-shot Learning (GZSL), a parametric novelty detection mechanism is introduced. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on ZSL and GZSL tasks across three visual attribute datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness and advantages of the framework.", "The prevalent perspective asserting that Category Theory supports Mathematical Structuralism is mistaken. The foundations of mathematics based on Category Theory demand a distinct philosophy of mathematics. Structural mathematics, as argued by Awodey, examines unchanging forms, while categorical mathematics focuses on changing transformations that typically lack invariants. In this paper, I propose a non-structuralist reading of categorical mathematics and explore its implications for the history of mathematics and mathematics education.", "We demonstrate that in a dynamic system of a certain kind of material in which energy is not balanced, a circular pump creates stable memory units called vortices with a charge of $1$ or $-1$. By using basic guiding tools, we can decide to duplicate or change the charge onto a different circular pump. This ability to control binary data could lead to a new way of computing using vortices as safeguarded memory parts.", "During the assessment phase of the ESA Cosmic Vision LOFT mission, we evaluated radiation damage on silicon drift detectors (SDDs) by irradiating them with protons and bombarding them with hypervelocity dust grains. Our findings are detailed in this paper, shedding light on the impact of radiation on the detectors for the LOFT mission.", "In this study, we explore the effectiveness of utilizing low-level multimodal features to determine similarities between movies, within the realm of a content-based movie recommendation system. Specifically, we showcase the creation of multimodal representation models for movies by analyzing textual data from subtitles, along with insights from the audio and visual domains. In the text aspect, we emphasize our investigation into topic modeling based on movie subtitles to identify distinguishing topics. For the visual domain, we concentrate on deriving meaningful features that capture camera movements, colors, and facial expressions. In the audio domain, we employ basic classification approaches using preexisting models. By integrating these three modalities with static metadata (such as directors and actors), we establish that enriching a content-based movie similarity algorithm with low-level multimodal data can significantly enhance its performance.\n\nTo illustrate our content representation methodology, we curated a dataset comprising 160 well-known movies. We present movie similarities derived from each individual modality and their fusion, manifested in recommendation rankings. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that leveraging low-level features from text, audio, and visual components markedly improves the performance of a content-based recommendation system, exhibiting over a 50% enhancement compared to conventional metadata-centric approaches. Notably, our innovative strategy stands out as the first to leverage a broad spectrum of features from all modalities involved to elevate content similarity estimation beyond traditional metadata-focused techniques.", "We analyze black hole radiation from a charged Reissner-Nordstrom black hole within the framework of quantum gravity. By applying canonical quantization to a spherically symmetric geometry and making physically plausible assumptions, we solve the Wheeler-De Witt equation in the regions between the outer apparent horizon and spatial infinity, as well as between the spacetime singularity and the inner apparent horizon. We find that the mass loss rate of an evaporating black hole due to thermal radiation aligns with the semiclassical result when we appropriately choose an integration constant based on physical reasoning. Additionally, we solve the Wheeler-De Witt equation between the inner Cauchy horizon and the outer apparent horizon, demonstrating that the mass loss rate of an evaporating black hole follows the same expression. This study extends the analysis from a Schwarzschild black hole to a charged Reissner-Nordstrom black hole.", "Introducing Multi-Agent A* (MAA*): The innovative and pioneering heuristic search algorithm tailored for addressing decentralized partially-observable Markov decision problems (DEC-POMDPs) with finite horizon scenarios. This algorithm shines in generating optimal plans for a coordinated group of agents navigating through stochastic environments. Its applications range from multirobot collaboration to network traffic management and distributed resource allocation, highlighting its versatility in tackling uncertainty-laden challenges. By amalgamating classical heuristic search with decentralized control theory, our solution offers a unique approach to tackling such complex problems. Empirical evidence underscores the considerable benefits of MAA*, while the introduction of an anytime variant opens up exciting possibilities. This discussion culminates with insights into potential future enhancements, including strategies for handling infinite horizon problems.", "We used machine learning to classify objects in SDSS DR6 based on Galaxy Zoo's classifications into three classes: early types, spirals, and point sources/artifacts. We trained an artificial neural network on a subset of objects classified by humans and tested if it could replicate human classifications for the rest of the sample.\n\nThe success of the neural network in matching human classifications depends on the input parameters chosen for the machine-learning algorithm. Using colors and parameters from profile-fitting helps distinguish objects into the three classes, but adding adaptive shape parameters, concentration, and texture significantly improves the results.\n\nHowever, adaptive moments, concentration, and texture parameters alone are not enough to distinguish early type galaxies from point sources/artifacts. By using a set of twelve parameters, the neural network can replicate human classifications with over 90% accuracy for all three morphological classes.\n\nSurprisingly, having an incomplete training set in terms of magnitude does not impact our results due to our careful selection of input parameters for the network. This suggests that machine learning algorithms can effectively classify morphology for future wide-field imaging surveys, with the Galaxy Zoo catalogue serving as a valuable training set.", "The Lambek calculus is a renowned formal logical system utilized for the representation of syntax in natural language. The original formulation of the calculus comprehensively addressed numerous complex linguistic phenomena within the context-free framework. To accommodate more nuanced linguistic concepts, the Lambek calculus has undergone several extensions. Notably, Morrill and Valentin (2015) introduced an extension incorporating exponential and bracket modalities. Their extension features a non-standard contraction rule for the exponential operator that intricately interacts with the bracket structure. The conventional contraction rule is not applicable in this calculus. This study establishes the undecidability of the derivability problem within their extended calculus. Additionally, we examine specific resolvable fragments as identified by Morrill and Valentin, demonstrating that these fragments fall into the NP complexity class.", "The transition between the two phases of 4D Euclidean Dynamical Triangulation was initially considered to be of second order. However, in 1996, a discovery revealed first-order behavior in sufficiently large systems. An inquiry arises regarding the potential impact of numerical techniques used in these studies. Notably, both investigations incorporated an artificial harmonic potential to manage volume fluctuations. Measurement procedures in one of the studies introduced an error by assessing results after a fixed number of accepted, rather than attempted, moves. Furthermore, the simulations contended with pronounced critical slowing down, which may have been underestimated.\n\nOur current research endeavors to address these limitations. We enable volume fluctuations within a specific range, adjust measurement protocols for attempted moves, and mitigate critical slowing down using an optimized parallel tempering algorithm. Through these refined methodologies, applied to systems of up to 64k 4-simplices, we validate the first-order nature of the phase transition. Additionally, we introduce a localized criterion for identifying states of elongation or crumpling within a triangulation and establish a novel relationship between EDT and the balls in boxes model. This connection yields a modified partition function with an extra, third coupling factor.\n\nFinally, we propose and justify a class of adapted path-integral measures that could eliminate the metastability of the Markov chain and shift the phase transition to second order.", "We identify the finitely generated groups with virtually nilpotent growth (or groups of polynomial growth according to Gromov's theorem) in which the Domino Problem can be solved.

In our study, we found that specific sharp features in the gamma-ray spectrum around the mass of the dark matter particles could greatly improve how well we can detect dark matter using gamma-ray telescopes. By focusing on these features, we can put better limits on dark matter properties compared to looking at the overall gamma-ray spectrum at lower energies.", "Achieving carbon neutrality necessitates a focused research agenda that tackles the technical and economic obstacles encountered in transitioning to 100% renewable electricity generation. The growing use of variable renewable energy sources, such as wind turbines and solar panels, complicates the balancing act between energy supply and demand in renewable energy-powered grids. It is crucial to pay attention to the operational characteristics and impacts of variable renewable energy inverters. In this analysis, we explore the shifts involved in moving towards carbon neutrality and outline the research challenges related to system planning, operation, and stability. We emphasize the importance of integrating energy storage, engaging demand-side participation, implementing distributed control and estimation, and coupling different sectors of the energy industry. We also identify areas where existing literature falls short and present recent studies that contribute to filling these gaps, ultimately leading to better grid management and estimation practices. Additionally, we provide numerical findings from comparative case studies on the operational stability and economic aspects of power grids with a high percentage of variable renewable energy sources. These results help stakeholders create targeted action plans and informed decisions.", "Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are widely used in computer vision due to their ability to process large amounts of labeled data through numerous parameters. However, as CNN model sizes grow, so do their storage and memory demands. The introduction of Frequency-Sensitive Hashed Nets (FreshNets) offers an innovative network architecture that reduces memory and storage requirements by capitalizing on redundancy in convolutional and fully-connected layers of deep learning models. FreshNets leverages the smooth and low-frequency nature of weights in learned convolutional filters by converting them to the frequency domain using a discreet cosine transform (DCT) and grouping them into hash buckets using a low-cost hash function. Parameters sharing the same hash bucket are set to a single value learned through standard back-propagation. Additionally, fewer hash buckets are allocated to high-frequency components, which are usually less critical. Evaluation across eight datasets demonstrates that FreshNets outperforms various baseline methods in terms of compressed performance improvement.", "We carried out an innovative exercise inspired by Japanese manga techniques in the field of Requirements Development (RD) as part of a Project-Based Learning (PBL) approach.

By considering the impacts of quantum gravity, we explore the tunnelling of fermions from a rotating 5-dimensional black string. The temperature is controlled not just by the string itself but is also influenced by the quantum properties of the emitted fermion and the presence of an additional spatial dimension. The quantum adjustment decelerates the rise in temperature, leading organically to the formation of remnants during the evaporation process.", "We present second-order vector representations of words derived from topological features in pre-trained contextual word embeddings. We investigate the impact of using second-order embeddings in two deep natural language processing models: named entity recognition, recognizing textual entailment, and a linear model for paraphrase recognition. Surprisingly, we discover that nearest neighbor information alone suffices to capture most performance benefits from pre-trained word embeddings. Second-order embeddings excel in handling diverse data but sacrifice specificity. Augmenting contextual embeddings with second-order data further enhances model performance in some scenarios. Utilizing nearest neighbor features from multiple first-order embedding samples can also boost downstream performance due to variance in random initializations. Lastly, we uncover interesting characteristics in second-order embedding spaces, including higher density and varying semantic interpretations of cosine similarity, warranting further investigation.", "We are studying how Reflecting Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) can enhance the performance of millimeter wave wireless systems. RIS helps to maintain a strong signal connection even when there are obstacles and improves coverage. Additionally, we explore how RIS can improve location detection during communication. By using special algorithms to estimate channel conditions accurately, we can determine the positions of devices more precisely. However, in systems with many RIS elements and large communication arrays, the process of estimating channels accurately can be challenging. To address this, we suggest using a method called multidimensional orthogonal matching pursuit for compressive channel estimation. This method reduces the complexity of the estimation process by using multiple dictionaries instead of one large dictionary. By applying this method along with a unique localization technique that does not rely on specific timing signals, we found that the accuracy of location detection in a realistic indoor setting was significantly enhanced in RIS-enhanced wireless systems.", "Revised passage:\n\nDetecting and quantifying information leaks through timing side channels is crucial for maintaining confidentiality. While static analysis is commonly used for detecting timing side channels, it poses computational challenges when applied to real-world scenarios. Moreover, these detection techniques typically provide binary 'yes' or 'no' results. Real-world applications, however, may have to disclose certain information, necessitating the use of quantification techniques to assess the risks associated with information leaks. Due to the complexity of both problems for static analysis methods, we propose a dynamic analysis approach. Our innovative method involves breaking down the task into two components. Firstly, we construct a neural network to learn the timing patterns of the program. Secondly, we examine the neural network to estimate the extent of information leakage. Our experiments confirm that both components are viable in practice, marking a significant advancement over current side channel detection and quantification methods. The key contributions of our work include a neural network architecture for detecting side channels and an MILP-based algorithm for measuring the strength of these channels. Through tests on micro-benchmarks and real-world applications, we demonstrate that neural network models can efficiently capture timing behaviors of programs with thousands of methods. Additionally, we show that employing neural networks with numerous neurons enables effective detection and quantification of information leaks via timing side channels.", "The region within the asteroid belt spanning from 2.1 to 2.5 astronomical units possesses notable dynamical importance due to its role as the primary origin of chondritic meteorites and near-Earth asteroids. This inner zone is delimited by an eccentricity-type secular resonance and the 1:3 mean motion resonance with Jupiter. Should asteroid perihelia not be sufficiently low to permit scattering by Mars, escape necessitates a transfer to one of the enclosing resonances. Yarkovsky forces are generally ineffective in altering the eccentricity and inclination of asteroids with a diameter exceeding 30 km. Consequently, significant changes in eccentricities are crucial for the escape of large asteroids with pericentres distant from Mars from the inner belt.\n\nThis study investigates the chaotic diffusion of orbits proximate to the 1:2 mean motion resonance with Mars in a methodical manner. The analysis reveals that while the chaotic evolution of orbits, both within and outside of resonance, increases the variability of inclinations and eccentricities, it does not substantially affect their average values. Notably, while dispersive evolution is most pronounced for resonant orbits, at elevated eccentricities, the resonance serves to alleviate asteroidal scattering by Mars, consequently extending the asteroid lifetime within the belt compared to non-resonant orbits. It is noteworthy that gravitational forces alone are inadequate for achieving the necessary changes in eccentricity to explain the observed variations for asteroids of varied sizes within resonant and non-resonant orbits. The function of resonant entrapment in shielding asteroids from encounters with Mars is also scrutinized.", "The existence of nonstandard neutrino interactions (NSI) significantly impacts the precision measurements conducted in forthcoming neutrino oscillation experiments. Additional types of experiments are essential to delimit the NSI parameter space. Our investigation focuses on the constraints of NSI involving electrons, utilizing data from both current and future $e^+e^-$ collider experiments, such as Belle II, STCF, and CEPC. Our analysis reveals that Belle II and STCF are poised to offer both competitive and complementary limits on electron-type NSI parameters, surpassing those obtained from the current global analysis, and markedly enhancing restrictions on tau-type NSI. Furthermore, CEPC by itself will establish rigorous constraints on the NSI parameter space concerning electrons. The correlation between the left-handed (vector) and right-handed (axial-vector) NSI parameters can be resolved by pooling data from three distinct operational modes, leading to narrower allowable ranges for $|\\epsilon_{ee}^{eL}|$ ($|\\epsilon_{ee}^{eV}|$) and $|\\epsilon_{ee}^{eR}|$ ($|\\epsilon_{ee}^{eA}|$), which could be restricted to less than 0.002 at CEPC, even in the presence of both.", "The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is an advanced project focused on conducting research in neutrino physics and searching for proton decay.

The light detection system plays a critical role in triggering the charge acquisition system and gathering additional information from the scintillation light generated during particle interactions. The demonstrator incorporated five cryogenic photomultipliers with various base polarity configurations and wavelength shifting techniques. Data on scintillation light under different drift and amplification field conditions were collected during detector operation. The study findings have contributed to a better comprehension of certain Liquid Argon properties, including insights into light production and propagation.", "Exciting news!

Through the analysis of SDSS databases, it appears that AGN with mass M_BH \\lesssim 10^5 M_sun are notably absent. In this study, we delve into the question of whether these low mass black holes truly do not exist or if they remain undetected due to inefficient BEL production. By utilizing the ionizing spectral energy distribution across a broad black hole mass range from 10 - 10^9 M_sun, encompassing XRBs to AGN, we have calculated the equivalent widths (EWs) of key ultraviolet and optical lines: Ly\\alpha 1216 \\AA, H\\beta 4861 \\AA, CIV 1549 \\AA, and MgII 2798 \\AA. Our analysis employs the LOC (locally optimally emitting cloud) model to characterize the broad emission line region (BELR). We have discovered that while the hardening of the spectral energy distribution shape does not reduce the BEL EWs with decreasing mass, the size of the BELR - as determined by the line widths and controlled by the black hole mass - influences the production of these emission lines. Interestingly, we observe a peak in the EWs of emission lines for typical AGN black holes around ~ 10^8 M_sun. Below this mass, the lines progressively become dimmer, with a rapid decline below ~ 10^6 M_sun. This nuanced understanding sheds light on the potential reason for the dearth of low mass AGN in SDSS data.", "Absolutely! This text is brimming with excitement!

By adjusting the relative velocity to $v/c \\approx 0.002$, new QED calculations show a large spin-flip cross section of approximately $2 \\cdot 10^{13}$ barn in the triple spin-cross sections. Two approaches for generating a positron source with sufficient flux density are discussed. One option involves a polarised positron beam with a polarisation of 0.70 and a flux density of around $1.5 \\cdot 10^{10}$/(mm$^2$ s), achievable through a radioactive $^{11}$C dc-source. Another proposal suggests producing polarised positrons via pair production with circularly polarised photons, resulting in a polarisation of 0.76 and necessitating injection into a small storage ring. These polariser sources are applicable at both low (100 MeV) and high (1 GeV) energy storage rings, with a polarisation build-up time of about one hour for approximately $10^{10}$ antiprotons reaching a polarisation level of 0.18.

A theoretical framework for nucleic acid secondary structures, taking into consideration the logarithmic entropy c ln m for a loop of length m, is utilized to investigate homopolymeric single-stranded nucleic acid chains under varying temperature and external force conditions. In the scenario of a long strand in the thermodynamic limit, the chain undergoes a phase transition between a compact (folded) structure at low temperature/low force and a molten (unfolded) structure at high temperature/high force. The analytical derivation showcases the impact of the loop exponent c on phase diagrams, critical exponents, melting behavior, and force-extension curves. It is shown that a melting transition is only feasible for a limited range of loop exponents (2 < c < 2.479) in the absence of a pulling force, with the chain predominantly in the folded phase for c <= 2 and always in the unfolded phase for c > 2.479. A force-induced melting transition with singular behavior can occur for loop exponents c < 2.479, potentially detectable through experimental methods like single molecule force spectroscopy. These insights are significant for understanding processes such as hybridization or denaturation of double-stranded nucleic acids. The study also demonstrates that the Poland-Scheraga model for nucleic acid duplex melting does not account for base pairing between nucleotides on the same strand in denatured regions, leading to lower duplex melting temperatures than predicted. Moreover, for a realistic loop exponent around c ~ 2.1, pronounced secondary structures emerge within single strands, impacting the effective loop exponent c^ and universal aspects of the duplex melting transition.", "Discover the revolutionary potential of Zeeman spin-splitting in hole quantum wires!

Consequently, it is demonstrated that this allocation harmonizes with the process of tensor product formation: the resultant dimensions of space and time in the tensor product are cumulative totals of those within its constituent components. This framework potentially furnishes an elucidation for the prevalence of such algebras in PT-symmetric Hamiltonians and the elucidation of topological substance. Leveraging this framework, an indefinite (pseudo-Riemannian) iteration of noncommutative geometry's spectral triples is fashioned, situated within Krein spaces as opposed to Hilbert spaces.

The interaction between theory and numerical simulations has raised awareness about the importance of magnetic fields in moving angular momentum. However, a major challenge remains in using insights from simulations to enhance practical models for comparison with real observations. It's crucial to accurately account for non-local transport. When considering the bigger picture and what's currently lacking, we need to understand that the widely used Shakura-Sunyaev (1973, SS73) model is a mean field theory that overlooks large scale transport. Observations of coronae and jets, along with even the results from magnetic turbulence simulations, indicate that a significant portion of transport in accretion discs is non-local. It's shown that the dominant Maxwell stresses come from large scale effects, and the physics of magnetic turbulence transport goes beyond simple viscosity. The common interpretation of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in shearing boxes is further explained. While computational constraints have led to a focus on local simulations, the upcoming global simulations should aid in refining mean field theories. Mean field accretion and dynamo theories should be merged into a unified framework that predicts how spectra and luminosity evolve from the different contributions of discs, coronae, and outflows. It's important to remember that any mean field theory can only provide a finite level of predictive accuracy, which must be considered when comparing predictions to observations.", "This paper is all about studying how incompressible two-phase fluid mixtures move in a smooth, enclosed area $\\Omega$ in the presence of capillarity effects.

We\u2019re looking at two systems: the mass-conserving Navier-Stokes-Allen-Cahn system for different fluids and the mass-conserving Euler-Allen-Cahn system for identical fluids. Our goal is to show that global weak and strong solutions exist uniquely and how they separate from pure states. To do this, we're using energy and entropy estimates, an innovative end-point estimate for functions, a new approach for the Stokes problem with varying viscosity, and Gronwall arguments with a logarithmic twist.", "We provide precise formulations for Fock-space projection operators representing actual final states in scattering experiments.

Additionally, a novel optimization method called memory replay back-propagation (MRBP) helps facilitate long-range back-propagation through time with reduced memory requirements. Experimental findings indicate that Memformer performs comparably to baseline models while using significantly less memory space (8.1x less) and being faster in inference (3.2x). The attention pattern analysis reveals that the external memory slots in Memformer can effectively encode and maintain crucial information across different timesteps.", "We determine the dominant logarithmic behavior of the cross-section for producing a pseudoscalar Higgs boson via gluon-gluon fusion at all orders in perturbation theory under the condition of high partonic center-of-mass energy.

Our findings are expressed in terms of definite integrals, calculated explicitly up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). By employing these results, we refine the existing NNLO comprehensive cross-section calculated within the framework of an effective theory that integrates out fermions in the loop.

An impartial random walk on districting plans may not lead us to solutions nearing the maximum count. To tackle this issue, many opt for a biased random walk strategy, favoring districting plans with a higher number of majority-minority districts. However, we introduce a more innovative approach called \"short bursts.\" In this method, we carry out an unbiased random walk for a short period (referred to as the burst length), then restart the walk from the most extreme plan encountered in the previous burst. Our experimental findings reveal that short bursts outperform biased random walks in maximizing the number of majority-minority districts. Furthermore, we highlight the flexibility of burst lengths in achieving this improvement. Expanding beyond our primary application, we explore the concept of short bursts in scenarios where the state space follows a line with diverse probability distributions. We investigate how the complexity of state spaces influences the efficacy of short bursts, offering valuable insights for further study.", "This study investigates how graphitic surfaces are wetted by different solutions containing 1-8 wt% of long hydrophilic chain non-ionic surfactants, using molecular dynamics simulations with a MARTINI force field.

Expanding machine translation to mixed-language data is now common for these languages. In the WMT 2022 shared tasks, we have been working on translating between English and Hindi with a mix called Hinglish, both ways. The first task involved data in both Roman and Devanagari scripts due to having monolingual data in English and Hindi. The second task only had data in Roman script. We achieved top scores for the first task in translating from a single language to mixed language. We discuss in detail our use of mBART with special pre-processing and post-processing (transliteration from Devanagari to Roman) for the first task, as well as the experiments we conducted for the second task, translating mixed Hinglish to standard English.", "Contrastive learning is proven to have great potential for self-supervised learning of spatio-temporal representations. Many existing approaches randomly sample different video clips to create positive and negative pairs, which, unfortunately, can introduce a bias towards the background scenes. There are two main reasons for this bias. First, differences in scenes are typically more obvious and easier to distinguish than differences in motion. Second, video clips from the same source often share similar backgrounds but have distinct patterns of motion. Simply treating such clips as positive pairs can lead the model to focus on the static backgrounds rather than the motion characteristics. In response to this challenge, this study introduces a new dual contrastive formulation. The approach breaks down the input RGB video sequence into two components: static scenes and dynamic motion. The original RGB features are then pulled closer to the static features and the corresponding dynamic features. This way, both the static scenes and dynamic motions are integrated into a concise RGB representation. Additionally, the study uses activation maps to separate static- and dynamic-related features in the feature space. The proposed method is named Dual Contrastive Learning for spatio-temporal Representation (DCLR). Extensive experiments show that DCLR effectively learns spatio-temporal representations and achieves performance comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art on UCF-101, HMDB-51, and Diving-48 datasets.", "The electronic bandstructure and Fermi surfaces of ferromagnetic CeRh3B2 have been calculated using the FLAPW and LSDA+U method. Instead of the conventional LS-coupled CEF ground state typically expected in 4f compounds, we propose a fully orbital- and spin-polarized state |lz=0, sx=1/2> as the ground state by considering various forms of the ground state to describe the 4f electronic state. This unconventional ground state is supported by the well-explained magnetic moment and dHvA frequencies based on the calculated electronic structure and Fermi surfaces. The strong 4f-4f direct mixing between neighboring Ce atoms along the extremely small distance in the hexagonal crystal cell along the c-axis stabilizes this unique ground state.", "Matrix acidization simulation presents a complex challenge in studying flows within porous media due to the varying porosity involved. One approach to simulate this process is through the enhanced DBF framework, which discretizes the mass and momentum conservation equations to create a pressure-velocity linear system. However, the presence of zeros in the diagonal of the coefficient matrix restricts the use of direct solvers for solving pressure and velocity simultaneously. Given the substantial scale of matrix acidization simulations, the time required by direct solvers for solving becomes impractical. To address this issue, a decoupled scheme is proposed in this research to separate the linked pressure-velocity linear system into two individual linear systems: one for pressure and the other for velocity. By utilizing parallel and iterative solvers, both linear systems can be solved effectively, enabling the completion of large-scale simulations in a reasonable time frame. A numerical experiment is conducted to validate the decoupled scheme's accuracy and its enhanced computational efficiency.", "Sensemaking and narrative are inherently interconnected concepts that shape how individuals perceive and make sense of the world around them. Sensemaking involves organizing and linking encountered information with existing knowledge and past inferences, while narratives are essential tools that people utilize to construct a more comprehensive understanding of the world. Both play critical roles in human cognition and would be beneficial for computational systems aiming to achieve similar tasks. This paper explores the theories of sensemaking and narrative, focusing on how individuals develop their understanding of the world through information processing and the relationship between these two fields. We specifically examine visual storytelling as a computational task that could benefit from integrating sensemaking and narrative elements. Furthermore, we present our system for visual storytelling, discuss its implementation, and provide examples of its current use.", "Evaluation metrics that fail to accommodate dialect variations not only hinder our ability to accurately gauge system performance across diverse user groups but also unfairly penalize systems for generating content in less commonly represented dialects. At present, a critical gap exists in quantifying how these metrics adapt to changes in dialect within generated utterances. This gap motivates us to establish dialect robustness and dialect awareness as primary objectives for NLG evaluation metrics. To address this challenge, we present a comprehensive set of approaches and associated statistical analyses for evaluating metrics in view of these objectives. By systematically applying our methods to current leading metrics, we reveal their lack of dialect robustness and highlight how even minor semantic modifications often exert a lesser impact on metrics than the inclusion of dialectical elements. To begin addressing this issue, we introduce a novel training framework, NANO, designed to enhance metric robustness by integrating regional and linguistic cues during the pretraining phase. Notably, our experiments showcase that NANO offers an efficient strategy for enhancing dialect robustness in models while simultaneously boosting their performance on standard metric assessments.", "Geographic routing utilizes the position information of nodes to aid in routing within sensor networks. A key challenge in geographic routing is its practicality, as authors often rely on idealized wireless network assumptions or costly methods to planarize communication graphs. This study addresses the crucial questions of when and how to implement geographic routing effectively. The research outlines four principles that characterize geographic routing and examines their topological implications. By introducing the concept of geographic eccentricity for localized communication networks, a metric is provided to assess the suitability of a network for geographic routing. Furthermore, a distributed algorithm is presented to either facilitate geographic routing within the network or determine if such routing is not viable due to high geographic eccentricity.", "We demonstrate that the spatial variation and correlation of superconductivity fluctuations in a two-band model are influenced by two characteristic lengths. This leads to a significantly more complex scenario compared to single-band systems. Specifically, short-range correlations persist in a two-band scenario, even close to the phase transition point.", "We've got some online prediction methods for time series that are designed to handle those pesky nonstationary artifacts like trends and seasonality that show up in real time series. Basically, what we found is that by making some tweaks to those time series before making predictions, we can actually improve how well our predictions work - both in theory and in practice. \n\nNow, since figuring out those transformations can be a bit of a mystery, we've come up with a new online method called NonSTOP (NonSTationary Online Prediction) to predict nonstationary time series. This method is really cool because it can deal with things like seasonality, trends in single time series, and cointegration in multiple time series.\n\nOur algorithms and analysis go beyond what's been done recently in this area and make these methods more widely applicable. We even provide some pretty solid regret bounds without needing to make too many assumptions.\n\nBut here's the thing: the theory doesn't quite cover all the benefits of using those transformations, which is why we've taken a closer look with a data-driven analysis of the follow-the-leader algorithm. This gives us a better idea of why these transformations are working so well.\n\nTo back up all our claims, we've done experiments on both simulated and real data.", "We propose a heuristic framework as a novel approach to address the undecidable termination problem of logic programs, offering an alternative to current termination/non-termination proof methods. Our framework introduces the concept of termination prediction to assess the termination of a logic program in cases where traditional proof techniques are not applicable. This work includes a comprehensive analysis of infinite (generalized) SLDNF-derivations with various query types and presents an algorithm for predicting termination of general logic programs with diverse non-floundering queries. Furthermore, we have developed a termination prediction tool and conducted experiments yielding highly satisfactory results. Notably, our predictions were accurate for 100% of the 296 benchmark programs from the Termination Competition 2007, with only five programs exceeding the experimental time limit.

Moreover, the algorithm can be distributed across a network of computers, amplifying the learning process. Through rigorous experimentation, we demonstrate that our algorithm maintains the integrity of results, thus rivaling the established structured mean-field algorithm. Furthermore, it excels in handling extended sequences and large FHMMs, outperforming existing techniques.", "Molecular dynamics simulations were conducted on pure liquid water, sodium chloride solutions, and polymer solutions under an external electric field.

The origin and implications of this unusual entropy behavior are examined in detail in the context of thermodynamics.", "Many real-world challenges present complex and vast action spaces, making it impractical to consider all possible actions. Instead, we rely on sampling small subsets of actions for policy evaluation and enhancement. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for effectively addressing policy evaluation and refinement within these sampled action subsets.

We showcase the effectiveness of this approach through applications in renowned domains like the board game of Go, DeepMind Control Suite, and Real-World RL Suite.", "In this exciting study, we introduce two cutting-edge mask-based beamforming techniques leveraging a powerful deep neural network (DNN) trained using advanced multichannel loss functions. By harnessing the potential of time-frequency (TF)-masks estimated through the DNN, we open new doors for a myriad of applications where TF-masks are pivotal for spatial covariance matrix estimation. Departing from conventional methods, we have tailored our DNN training approach for mask-based beamforming using innovative monaural speech enhancement/separation loss functions. However, realizing the need for a more sophisticated criterion to truly enhance beamforming performance, we have pioneered the use of multichannel loss functions that assess spatial covariance matrices through the lens of the multichannel Itakura--Saito divergence. The DNNs trained using these state-of-the-art loss functions can be adeptly deployed to craft multiple beamformers, a breakthrough validated by promising experimental outcomes that underscore their potency and resilience across various microphone setups.", "Nano-FTIR imaging combines Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) with scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) to provide high-resolution images at the nanometer scale. However, capturing large areas with this technique can be time-consuming due to the need for sequential data collection. Various mathematical approaches have been suggested to address this issue, all of which involve taking only a small number of random measurements. However, selecting measurements randomly can be challenging and may not save as much time as desired. To improve efficiency, different sub-sampling methods have been explored. Results show that using specific sub-sampling schemes, such as original Lissajous, triangle Lissajous, and random reflection sub-sampling at a rate of 10%, can provide comparable results to random sub-sampling. This suggests that random sub-sampling may not be necessary for efficient data acquisition.", "We extract the screening masses in the deconfined phase of the (3+1)-dimensional SU(3) pure gauge theory at finite temperature in proximity to the transition point by analyzing Polyakov loop correlators. This analysis investigates two distinct channels characterized by angular momentum and parity. We subsequently evaluate the ratio of these screening masses and juxtapose it with the analogous ratio of massive excitations possessing parallel quantum numbers in the 3-dimensional 3-state Potts model within the broken phase near the transition point under zero magnetic field conditions. Furthermore, we examine the reciprocal decay length of correlations between the real and imaginary components of the Polyakov loop, contrasting our findings with anticipated outcomes from both perturbation theory and mean-field Polyakov loop models.", "The Mahalanobis distance-based confidence score, an anomaly detection method for pre-trained neural classifiers, achieves state-of-the-art performance for both out-of-distribution (OoD) and adversarial examples detection. This study analyzes its strong performance in practical settings despite an implausible assumption that pre-trained features' class conditional distributions have tied covariance. While claimed to be motivated by classification prediction confidence, the method's superior performance is found to stem from information not useful for classification. Contrary to popular belief, the success of the Mahalanobis confidence score is attributed to different information compared to ODIN, another OoD detection method. Combining these two methods results in improved performance and robustness, shedding light on neural classifiers' behavior when faced with anomalous inputs.", "Algorithms for differentiating functional expressions manipulate mathematical expressions' syntactic structure in a mathematically significant way. A formalized algorithm should specify its computational behavior, its mathematical interpretation, and a method for applying it to actual expressions. Successfully achieving these goals requires integrating reasoning about expressions' syntax with reasoning about their meanings. A syntax framework is a mathematical structure that acts as an abstract model for a syntax reasoning system. It includes a mapping of expressions to syntactic values, a language for reasoning about these values, a mechanism for referring to these values, and a mechanism for evaluating the expressions they represent. We present and compare two approaches, both based on a syntax framework, for formalizing a syntax-based mathematical algorithm in a formal theory T. In the first approach, syntactic values are members of an inductive type in T, with quotation and evaluation being functions defined in T's metatheory. In the second approach, every expression in T is represented by a syntactic value, and quotation and evaluation are operators within T.", "The article discusses two consumer-resource pairs that interact with each other using chemostat-like equations. It is assumed that the resource's dynamics are much slower than that of the consumer. By having two different time scales, a comprehensive analysis of the problem can be carried out. This analysis involves treating consumers and resources in the connected system as variables with different speeds, and studying the phase plane developments of these variables independently. When not connected, each pair has a stable steady state and does not exhibit self-sustained oscillatory behavior, although damped oscillations near the equilibrium are possible. However, when the consumer-resource pairs are weakly linked through direct reciprocal inhibition of consumers, the entire system displays self-sustained relaxation oscillations with a period that can be significantly longer than the intrinsic relaxation time of either pair. The model equations are shown to effectively describe locally connected consumer-resource systems of varying types, such as living populations in interspecific interference competition and lasers linked through their cavity losses.", "Wireless local area networks (WLAN) face challenges with uneven performance among users in the uplink due to varying channel conditions. Cooperative medium access control (MAC) protocols, such as CoopMAC, have been introduced to address this issue.

For networks based on carrier sense multiple access (CSMA), the relationship between throughput and bit-cost is analyzed. A new distributed CSMA protocol, fairMAC, is proposed and demonstrated to approach any point on the tradeoff curve as packet lengths increase, with results confirmed through Monte Carlo simulations.", "Social tagging is an effective method to enhance search and navigation on the web by allowing users to collectively add tags to resources.

This bodes well for fields like medicine, where the minority class often holds utmost significance.", "Our study delves into the fascinating world of interactions between shocks and clouds in the southern region of the HB 21 supernova remnant. Utilizing data from the InfraRed Camera (IRC) on the AKARI satellite and the Wide InfraRed Camera (WIRC) at the Palomar 5 m telescope, we captured near- and mid-infrared glimpses of this dynamic interplay. The images obtained reveal intriguing diffuse patterns surrounding a shocked CO cloud, providing us with valuable insights.\n\nBy examining the emission patterns and comparing them with various shock models, we uncovered interesting parallels. The observed IRC colors align well with the thermal admixture model of H2 gas, where the intricate relationship between infinitesimal H2 column density and temperature follows a power-law distribution. Our analysis yielded key parameters such as n(H2) \u2248 3.9 x 10^4 cm^-2, b \u2248 4.2, and N(H2; T>100K) \u2248 2.8 x 10^21 cm^-2, shedding light on the underlying processes at play.\n\nDiving deeper into the data, we explored different scenarios of shock-cloud interactions, ranging from multiple planar C-shocks to bow shocks and shocked clumps. By scrutinizing these scenarios, we identified both their merits and limitations, enhancing our understanding of the complex dynamics at work.\n\nInterestingly, our findings revealed that the observed H2 v=1->0 S(1) intensity surpasses the predictions derived from the power-law admixture model, mirroring trends observed in the northern region of HB 21. Furthermore, we delved into the constraints of the thermal admixture model, fine-tuning our model parameters to enhance its predictive power.\n\nIn essence, our study opens new doors of exploration in the realm of shock-cloud interactions, unraveling the mysteries hidden within the fabric of the HB 21 supernova remnant.", "Vision transformers have been making quite an impact lately with impressive results that surpass larger convolution-based models. However, when it comes to small models for mobile or resource-limited devices, ConvNets still hold their own by offering advantages in performance and model complexity. That's where ParC-Net comes in - a ConvNet backbone model that leverages the strengths of vision transformers into ConvNets. \n\nWe introduce position-aware circular convolution (ParC), a lightweight convolution operation that combines the benefits of global receptive fields with location-sensitive features similar to local convolutions. By integrating ParCs with squeeze-excitation operations, we create a meta-former-like model block that includes an attention mechanism similar to transformers. This versatile block can be easily plugged in to replace relevant blocks in ConvNets or transformers. \n\nOur experiments demonstrate that ParC-Net outperforms popular lightweight ConvNets and vision transformer-based models across various common vision tasks and datasets. For instance, in ImageNet-1k classification, ParC-Net achieves a top-1 accuracy of 78.6% with just around 5.0 million parameters. This represents a 11% reduction in parameters and a 13% decrease in computational cost, all while achieving a 0.2% higher accuracy and 23% faster inference speed (on Arm-based Rockchip RK3288) compared to MobileViT. Moreover, ParC-Net uses only half the parameters of DeIT and yet achieves a 2.7% higher accuracy. \n\nIn object detection and segmentation tasks on MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets, ParC-Net also shows superior performance.

Various factors, including the price of magnetocaloric and magnet materials, along with operational expenses, impact the total cost. The most cost-effective solution, with a device lifespan of 15 years, ranges between \\$150 to \\$400, depending on material prices. The magnet cost is the highest, closely followed by operational expenses, while the magnetocaloric material cost is relatively insignificant. For the most economical option, an optimal magnetic field of about 1.4 T, a particle size of 0.23 mm, a regenerator length of 40-50 mm, and a utilization rate of approximately 0.2 is recommended across different scenarios. The operating frequency, however, varies with the device lifespan.

Furthermore, our empirical findings indicate that the inclusion of two adjustable parameters does not significantly enhance the overall efficacy of the CosRA metric.", "Many real-world applications are now using multi-label data streams as the need for algorithms that can handle rapidly changing data grows. As data distribution evolves, which is often referred to as concept drift, existing classification models may struggle to remain effective. To support these classifiers, we have introduced a new algorithm called Label Dependency Drift Detector (LD3). LD3 is an implicit (unsupervised) concept drift detector that utilizes label dependencies within the data for multi-label data streams.\n\nOur approach involves examining the dynamic temporal relationships between labels by using a label influence ranking method. This method incorporates a data fusion algorithm to identify label dependencies and uses the resulting ranking to detect concept drift. LD3 stands out as the first unsupervised concept drift detection algorithm in the field of multi-label classification.\n\nIn our study, we conducted a thorough evaluation of LD3 by comparing it with 14 well-known supervised concept drift detection algorithms.

Our analysis includes calculating the probability distribution of rupture forces and exploring the impact of finite rebinding probabilities on the dynamic force spectrum. We pay special attention to barrier crossing during extension under a linearly increased load, and during relaxation starting from completely separated bonds.\n\nFor high loading rates, the rupture force and rejoining force exhibit the expected dependence on the loading rate dictated by the potential's shape. Conversely, at low loading rates, the mean forces from pull and relax modes converge as the system nears equilibrium. We explore how the rupture force distributions and mean rupture forces vary with external parameters such as cantilever stiffness and the presence of a soft linker.\n\nOur findings reveal that the equilibrium rupture force remains unchanged with the addition of the linker in some cases, while in others, it varies predictably with the linker's compliance.

By integrating the role model strategy with time averaging, a statistical model is built by solving a convex optimization problem numerically. Originally devised for simplifying decoder design in iterative decoding, this strategy offers potential applications in various fields beyond communications.", "Computer vision systems currently face challenges in reliably recognizing artistically depicted objects, notably in cases with scarce data availability. This paper introduces a novel methodology for identifying objects portrayed in artistic formats, including paintings, cartoons, and sketches, without the need for annotated data within these domains. Our approach uniquely addresses stylistic differences across various artistic domains by introducing a supplementary training modality designed to mirror the artistic style of the target domain. By fostering the learning of invariant features between these training modalities, we strive to bridge the gap caused by domain shifts, both within and between domains. Notably, we propose a method to automatically generate artificial labeled source domains using style transfer techniques, leveraging a diverse set of target images to encapsulate the stylistic essence of the target domain. Unlike conventional approaches that rely heavily on unlabeled target data, our method showcases effectiveness with as few as ten unlabeled images. Through a comprehensive evaluation on diverse cross-domain object and scene classification tasks, as well as the introduction of a novel dataset, we demonstrate significant enhancements in artistic object recognition accuracy compared to conventional domain adaptation methodologies.", "Explore the fascinating study of the long-term dynamics of solutions to semi-linear Cauchy problems with quadratic nonlinearity in gradients! In this research, we delve into the behavior of solutions in the face of complex state spaces and potential degeneracy at the state space's boundaries. Through our investigation, we unveil two captivating outcomes: first, witnessing the solution and its gradient converge pointwise; second, observing the solutions gravitate towards associated backward stochastic differential equations. Noteworthy is the fact that these remarkable convergences are achieved by imposing growth conditions on model coefficients in scenarios where the state space equals R^d or comprises positive definite matrices. These findings hold great significance in the realms of risk-sensitive control and the intricate decisions surrounding long-term portfolio management!", "The Decaying Vacuum model (DV), which regards dark energy as a dynamic vacuum, has recently been thoroughly examined. In this model, the vacuum energy diminishes proportionally with the Hubble parameter during late times ($\\rho_\\Lambda(t) \\propto H(t)$), resulting in the creation of an additional matter component. By analyzing data from various sources such as supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, baryon acoustic oscillations, cosmic microwave background (CMB), the Hubble rate, and X-rays in galaxy clusters, we have constrained the parameters of the DV model. Our analysis reveals that the optimal fit for the matter density contrast $\\Omega_m$ in the DV model significantly exceeds that of the $\\Lambda$CDM model. Confidence contours in the $\\Omega_m-h$ plane are provided up to a 3\u03c3 confidence level, along with the normalized likelihoods of $\\Omega_m$ and $h,\" respectively.", "Magnificent MgO-based Magnetic Tunnel Junctions stand out as the prime building blocks for Spin Transfer Torque (STT) magnetoresistive memories. Yet, the challenge remains to achieve a switching current density below 106 A/cm2. Luckily, a recent groundbreaking study by Wang et al. in Nature Mater. (Jan. 2012) has unveiled an innovative approach that utilizes an electric-field to achieve magnetization switching at an ultra-low current density. While previous investigations focused on a macrospin perspective, our work delves into a comprehensive micromagnetic study. Our findings reveal a fascinating journey of complex nucleation processes, involving the birth of magnetic vortexes, leading to the ultimate switching phenomenon.", "We introduce an extension of Rosenblatt's classic perceptron learning algorithm to incorporate proximal activation functions. We show how this extension can be viewed as a stepwise gradient approach applied to an innovative energy function. This energy function is constructed using a generalized Bregman distance, eliminating the need for differentiating the activation function to compute gradients with respect to the weights and biases. Viewing the algorithm as an energy minimization technique opens avenues for developing new algorithms. As an example, we delve into a fresh version of the iterative soft-thresholding algorithm tailored for training sparse perceptrons.", "The phenomenon of the radiation force exerted on an object by an acoustic wave has been extensively researched since the early studies by Rayleigh, Langevin, and Brillouin. This research has resulted in significant advancements in acoustic micromanipulation over the past decade. Despite considerable investigation into this phenomenon, the expressions for the acoustic radiation force acting on a particle have only been derived for a stationary particle, without considering the impact of its movement on the radiated wave. In this study, we examine the acoustic radiation force acting on a monopolar source moving at a constant velocity significantly lower than the speed of sound. Our findings demonstrate that the asymmetry in the emitted field caused by the Doppler effect generates a radiation force on the source opposing its direction of motion.", "Modeling the base of the solar convective envelope poses a complex and challenging task. Solar researchers have long been intrigued by the small yet pivotal tachocline region, where the transition from differential to solid body rotation occurs, and which plays a crucial role in the Sun's dynamics, including the solar magnetic dynamo. Despite advancements in solar modeling, discrepancies persist in the understanding of this region, particularly in the sound speed profile. In this paper, we present a compelling case for using helioseismology to gain valuable insights into the tachocline through inversions of the Ledoux discriminant. By comparing these inversions across different Solar Models, we aim to shed light on the factors contributing to discrepancies between theoretical models and observations of the Sun.", "The aim is to understand human behavior and apply it to artificial reasoning techniques, such as game theory, theory of mind, and machine learning. Future autonomous systems will involve AI agents working with humans. These systems will need to incorporate models of human behavior to replicate and understand human actions, operating symbiotically with users. This paper focuses on exploring quantitative models of human behavior, including techniques like Reinforcement Learning and modeling human reasoning mechanisms like beliefs and bias without relying on trial-and-error learning.", "Breaking down botnets has always been challenging, especially with the increasing robustness of C&C channels in P2P botnets. This paper presents a probabilistic method to reconstruct the C&C channel topologies for P2P botnets, addressing the difficulty caused by the geographic dispersion of botnet members. Our approach estimates connection probabilities using inaccurate receiving times of cascades, network model parameters, and end-to-end delay distribution of the Internet. Simulations demonstrate that over 90% of edges in a 1000-member network with a mean node degree of 50 can be accurately estimated by collecting receiving times of 22 cascades, and even with receiving times from just half the bots, an accuracy of estimation is achieved using 95 cascades.", "Rephrased passage:\nIn grand unified theories (GUT), non-universal boundary conditions for the gaugino masses may manifest at the unification scale, influencing the visibility of the neutral MSSM Higgs bosons (h/H/A) at the LHC. We examine the impact of such non-universal gaugino masses on Higgs boson production within the SUSY cascade decay chain: gluino --> squark quark, squark --> neutralino_2 quark, neutralino_2 --> neutralino_1 h/H/A, h/H/A --> b b-bar created in pp interactions. With universal gaugino masses in the singlet representation, only the light Higgs boson can appear in this cascade in the region of interest. However, if non-universal gaugino masses are considered, heavy neutral MSSM Higgs boson production may become prominent. We explore the permissible parameter space complying with the WMAP constraints on the cold dark matter relic density in these scenarios. Our analysis reveals that varying representations can yield the necessary dark matter content across the entire parameter space. Furthermore, in the non-universal scenario, heavy Higgs bosons are detectable in regions where the WMAP-preferred neutralino relic density exists within the studied cascade.", "Subwavelength modulators are essential components in integrated photonic-electronic circuits. Developing a modulator with a nanometer-scale footprint, low switching energy, low insertion loss, and a substantial modulation depth is a persistent challenge due to limited light-matter interactions. This paper presents a novel approach with a vanadium dioxide dual-mode plasmonic waveguide electroabsorption modulator utilizing a metal-insulator-VO$_2$-insulator-metal (MIVIM) waveguide platform. By controlling the refractive index of vanadium dioxide, the modulator redirects plasmonic waves through a low-loss dielectric insulator layer in the \"on\" state and a high-loss VO$_2$ layer in the \"off\" state. This design greatly reduces insertion loss while maintaining a significant modulation depth. This compact waveguide modulator can achieve a modulation depth of approximately 10dB with dimensions of only 200x50x220nm$^3$ (or ~\u03bb$^3$/1700) and a required drive voltage of about 4.6V. Such high-performance plasmonic modulators could be a critical component in the advancement of fully-integrated plasmonic nanocircuits in future chip technologies.", "As cars become more technologically advanced, preventing automobile theft has become a significant challenge. Various methods such as data mining, biometrics, and additional authentication techniques are being proposed to address this issue. Among these methods, data mining stands out as an efficient approach to identify unique characteristics of the owner driver. Previous works have utilized supervised learning algorithms on driving data to distinguish between the owner driver and potential thieves. However, gathering and applying the thief's driving pattern is not practical. To tackle this challenge, a driver identification method using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) is proposed. GAN allows for the creation of an identification model solely based on the owner driver's data. By training GAN with data from the owner driver and using the trained discriminator for identification, the proposed method shows promising results in recognizing the owner driver accurately from actual driving data. Combining various driver authentication methods with this model could lead to effective automobile theft prevention measures being implemented in the real world.", "Slow changes in the resistance to magnetic fields are a simple way to measure electronic properties in flat metals. We explore using this method on materials with multiple conducting pathways, like iron-based superconductors. Our study reveals that this technique can also determine how electrons move between layers in these materials, similar to how it works for simpler metals. Additionally, slow changes in resistance can help compare how heavy electrons are or how easily they scatter within different conducting pathways.", "Recent progress in the field of precision calculations for Standard Model processes at the LHC is absolutely thrilling!

We tried out different DNN structures with various combinations of these features. Our models performed better than existing methods on a standard dataset. The MFCC-Text CNN model was particularly effective at recognizing emotions in the IEMOCAP dataset.", "In this article, we present a novel approach by incorporating variational semantic memory into meta-learning to gather enduring knowledge for tasks that involve learning from a limited amount of examples. This semantic memory system effectively gathers and retains semantic details to assist in predicting class prototypes in a hierarchical Bayesian setup. The memory system is constructed step by step and enhanced by assimilating insights gained from various tasks it encounters over time. This continuous process enables the memory system to accumulate broad, persistent knowledge that empowers it to grasp novel object concepts. We define the retrieval of memory as a method to infer a latent memory variable from specified inputs, which provides a systematic way to adjust the knowledge for specific tasks. Our variational semantic memory acts as a sophisticated long-term memory module, offering well-thought-out mechanisms for retrieval and modification that facilitate the effective accumulation and adaptation of semantic information for tasks with few examples. Experiments confirm that utilizing probabilistic models for prototypes results in a more informative depiction of object classes when compared to traditional deterministic vectors. The consistently superior performance achieved across various benchmarks underlines the advantage of employing variational semantic memory to enhance few-shot learning capabilities.", "The four-quark equations in relativistic settings, involving open-charm and open-strange components, are examined using a coupled-channel approach. The interaction between meson-meson and four-quark states is taken into account. Amplitudes related to four-quark structures, formed by quarks of various flavors (u, d, s, c), are developed. The masses of tetraquarks are determined by the poles of these amplitudes. Subsequently, the mass values for tetraquarks with spin-parity JP=1- and JP=2- are computed.", "Introducing Fisher4Cast: an open-source, easy-to-use Fisher Matrix framework for modern cosmological forecasting.

While symbolic representation allows for quantitative reasoning with statistical probability, it can be challenging to integrate with machine learning models due to their preference for numerical computation. Conversely, using knowledge embedding, such as high-dimensional continuous vectors, proves to be a viable method for intricate reasoning by preserving semantic details and establishing quantifiable relationships. This paper introduces the recursive neural knowledge network (RNKN), a fusion of first-order logic medical knowledge and recursive neural network for multi-disease diagnosis. By training RNKN on manually annotated Chinese Electronic Medical Records (CEMRs), it learns diagnosis-oriented knowledge embeddings and weight matrices efficiently. Experimental outcomes confirm that RNKN outperforms classical machine learning models and Markov logic network (MLN) in diagnostic accuracy. The study illustrates that the performance improves with more explicit evidence extracted from CEMRs. With each training epoch, RNKN progressively interprets knowledge embeddings.", "Multiple solenoids are typically integrated into an electron cooler device to precisely direct the trajectory of the electron beam within the cooler. However, these solenoids also affect the ion beam circulating in the cooler's storage ring. If the solenoids within the electron cooler are not perfectly compensated, the lateral movement of the ion beam in the storage ring becomes interconnected. This study focuses on examining the intertwined lateral motion caused by the uncompensated cooler solenoids in the CSRm (the primary storage ring at IMP, Lan Zhou, China), and employs a novel approach to calculate the resulting beam envelopes.", "A near-infrared excess detected at the white dwarf PHL5038 in UKIDSS photometry indicates the presence of a cool, substellar companion. Spectra and images obtained using NIRI on Gemini North confirm the presence of an 8000K DA white dwarf and a likely L8 brown dwarf companion, separated by 0.94\". The spectral type of the companion was determined using standard spectral indices for late L and T dwarfs. This binary system has a projected orbital separation of 55AU, making it the second known wide WD+dL binary after GD165AB. PHL5038 could serve as a benchmark for testing substellar evolutionary models at intermediate to older ages.", "Our study delves into how dynamical streams and substructure influence the determination of local escape speed and total mass in galaxies similar in size to the Milky Way, by analyzing the high velocity tail of halo stars in our vicinity. Through a series of high-resolution cosmological simulations that capture substructure in close proximity to positions akin to our solar system, we demonstrate that phase space structure displays notable differences across various locations within galaxies and throughout our simulation set. The uneven distribution of substructure in the high velocity tail leads to disparities in mass estimations. Factoring in streams, sampling errors, and limitations in measuring velocities below the escape speed, our analysis indicates that estimated masses tend to fall below the actual values by approximately 20%. The spread in mass estimates is also significant, with a variance of up to a factor of 2 across our simulation suite. By accounting for these biases, we refine the mass estimate for the Milky Way, as detailed in the work of Deason et al., to be $1.29 ^{+0.37}_{-0.47} \\times 10^{12}$ solar masses.", "By ditching the usual measurements and using fancy high-dimensional orbital angular momentum (OAM) states, we're able to snatch more than one bit per photon when hunting for stuff. It turns out, these OAM states are so chummy that even if the target object does a wild spin dance, the info we get from them doesn't change. Just relying on OAM connections alone can help us perfectly rebuild funky objects that are hanging out at weird angles. And hey, we even spotted some cool patterns in how OAM and objects interact! We checked out what happens when you move stuff off-center in the beam field and found that the object's signature symmetry and info rates don't care about what's going on around them, as long as it's far enough away. These findings could be super useful for scanning things smoothly, especially when you're after symmetry and wanna keep the measurements minimal.", "During Parker Solar Probe's initial orbits, widespread observations of rapid magnetic field reversals called switchbacks were noted in the near-Sun solar wind. These switchbacks, occurring in patches, may be linked to phenomena like magnetic reconnection near the solar surface. Used reduced distribution functions from the Solar Probe Cup instrument to compare temperatures inside and outside switchbacks, finding that proton core parallel temperatures remain consistent. The study suggests that switchbacks resemble Alfv\u00e9nic pulses traveling along open magnetic field lines, although their origin is uncertain. Additionally, there seems to be no direct connection between radial Poynting flux and kinetic energy enhancements in influencing switchback dynamics.", "In the Nainital-Cape Survey, researchers have identified eight $\\delta\\,$Scuti type pulsators showcasing pulsation periods spanning from a few minutes to several hours. To delve deeper into these intriguing pulsational behaviors, we conducted non-adiabatic linear stability analyses on models of these stars with masses ranging from 1 to 3 M$_{\\odot}$. Our investigations revealed the presence of several unstable low-order p-modes, with pulsation periods closely matching those observed in these stars. Notably, in stars like HD$\\,$118660, HD$\\,$113878, HD$\\,$102480, HD$\\,$98851, and HD$\\,$25515, we show that the observed variabilities can be elucidated by the low-order radial p-mode pulsations.", "A novel perspective on the classical mechanical formulation of particle trajectories in Lorentz-violating theories is presented in this work. The extended Hamiltonian formalism is employed to perform a Legendre Transformation between the related covariant Lagrangian and Hamiltonian representations. This methodology facilitates the computation of trajectories using Hamilton's equations in momentum space and the Euler-Lagrange equations in velocity space, particularly away from certain singular points that manifest within the theory. These singular points are resolved smoothly by demanding that the trajectories be continuous functions of both velocity and momentum variables. Moreover, particular sheets of the dispersion relations can be associated with specific solutions for the Lagrangian function. Detailed computations of examples pertaining to bipartite Finsler functions are provided. Furthermore, a special connection between the Lagrangians and the field-theoretic solutions to the Dirac equation is established in a particular instance.", "Efficient spectrum management is crucial for cognitive radio networks. Current research focuses on individual tasks like spectrum sensing, decision, sharing, or mobility. However, combining these tasks can enhance spectrum efficiency, especially in networks with multiple cognitive users and access points. The challenge lies in efficiently and autonomously coordinating spectrum decision and sharing among users and access points.", "Here is a fresh perspective on the text: \n\nAn elegant and solvable statistical model is introduced to analyze baryonic matter within the extreme thermodynamic conditions present during the development of core-collapse supernovae. The model unveils a noteworthy first-order phase transition in the grandcanonical ensemble, contrasting the behavior in the canonical ensemble. This deviation, akin to phenomena in condensed matter physics, manifests through negative susceptibility and abrupt changes in intensive variables linked to the order parameter. Such distinctive characteristics arise due to the interplay of short-range strong interactions and long-range electromagnetic forces acting on baryonic matter, mitigated by surrounding electrons. The presence of these complex dynamics is crucial for understanding nuclear matter within the context of stellar environments, thereby impacting our comprehension of supernova processes.", "A cutting-edge plan to enhance the performance of a THz-FEL (Free Electron Laser) involved the development of a compact FEL injector system. Instead of using the costly and intricate photo-cathode, a thermionic cathode was selected to emit electrons. By leveraging an enhanced EC-ITC (External Cathode Independently Tunable Cells) RF gun, the bunch charge was boosted to approximately 200pC and back bombardment effects were significantly reduced. The accelerator structures were optimized to raise the energy to around 14MeV, and a precise focusing system was implemented to suppress emittance and maintain the bunch state. Detailed analysis of the physical design and beam dynamics of crucial components for the FEL injector was conducted. Additionally, comprehensive start-to-end simulations with multiple pulses were carried out using custom MATLAB and Parmela software. The findings demonstrate the capability to consistently generate high brightness electron bunches with minimal energy deviation and emittance.", "Multiple assertions have surfaced regarding anomalies in the broad-angle features of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy as observed by WMAP. The statistical significance of these anomalies is often challenging, if not impossible, to determine as the statistical methods employed were selected after the fact. However, the prospect of uncovering new physics on the grandest observable scales is so captivating that it warrants a meticulous examination in my view. I will delve into three specific claims: the lack of significant power at broad angles, the asymmetry in power between the north and south regions, and alignments of multiple poles. Resolving the issue of post hoc statistics in all instances is most effectively achieved through the discovery of a fresh dataset that explores comparable physical scales to the broad-angle cosmic microwave background. While this undertaking is formidable, there are potential avenues to pursue in pursuit of this goal.", "Multi-photon states can be generated through multiple parametric down-conversion (PDC) processes. In such instances, a high-power pump is used on the nonlinear crystal. The more densely populated these states become in theory, the more they contradict a local realistic description. However, in multi-photon PDC experiments, the interference contrast can be minimal when high pumping is applied. We explain how this contrast can be enhanced using currently available optical tools, such as multiport beam splitters. These devices can divide incoming light from one input mode into $M$ output modes. Our approach functions as a POVM filter and may enable a viable CHSH-Bell inequality test, making it valuable for reducing communication complexity in various applications.", "The exponents of the transfer matrix spectrum reveal the localization lengths in Anderson's model for a particle moving through a lattice with disordered potential. By establishing a duality identity between determinants and applying Jensen's identity to subharmonic functions, a formula for the spectrum is derived in relation to the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian under non-Hermitian boundary conditions. This exact formula entails averaging over a Bloch phase instead of disorder. An initial examination of non-Hermitian spectra in Anderson's model is conducted in D=1,2, focusing on the smallest exponent.", "In this article, we enhance extreme learning machines for regression tasks by incorporating a graph signal processing based regularization. We work under the assumption that the predicted signal in regression tasks follows a graph structure. By applying this regularization, we aim to ensure that the extreme learning machine output is smoothly connected across the provided graph. Our simulations with real data demonstrate that this regularization is particularly beneficial when training data is limited and noisy.", "In order to accurately explain heat generation in turbulent plasmas with weak collisions, such as the solar wind, one must consider inter-particle interactions. These collisions can transform organized energy into thermal energy through the irreversible relaxation towards thermal equilibrium. A recent study by Pezzi and colleagues (Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 116, 2016, p. 145001) revealed that the collisionality of the plasma is heightened by the existence of intricate structures in velocity space. This analysis has been expanded by directly comparing the impacts of the fully nonlinear Landau operator with a linearized version. By examining the relaxation towards equilibrium of a distribution function that is out of equilibrium in a uniform force-free plasma, it becomes evident that accounting for nonlinearities in the collisional operator is crucial in assessing the significance of collisional effects. While both the nonlinear and linearized operators exhibit distinct characteristic times linked with the dissipation of various phase space structures, the influence of these times differs between the two scenarios. The characteristic times obtained from the linearized operator consistently tend to be longer than those from the fully nonlinear operator, indicating that fine velocity structures dissipate more slowly when nonlinearities are disregarded in the collisional operator.", "In our study, we showcased the utilization of Mask-RCNN (Regional Convolutional Neural Network), a sophisticated deep-learning algorithm designed for computer vision and specifically object detection, in the realm of semiconductor defect inspection. The task of stochastic defect detection and classification during semiconductor manufacturing has become increasingly complex due to the continual reduction in circuit pattern dimensions (e.g., for pitches less than 32 nm). Traditional defect inspection and analysis techniques employed by state-of-the-art optical and e-beam inspection tools often rely on rule-based methods, leading to frequent misclassification and thus requiring human expert intervention. In this study, we have enhanced and revisited our previous deep learning-based defect classification and detection methodology to achieve more precise defect instance segmentation in scanning electron microscope (SEM) images, along with the creation of individual masks for each defect category/instance. This enhanced method facilitates the extraction and calibration of each segmented mask, enabling the quantification of pixels comprising each mask. This, in turn, allows for the counting of categorical defect instances and the calculation of the surface area in terms of pixels. Our objective is to detect and segment various types of inter-class stochastic defect patterns including bridge, break, and line collapse, as well as accurately differentiate between intra-class multi-categorical defect bridge scenarios (such as thin/single/multi-line/horizontal/non-horizontal) for aggressive pitches and thin resists (High Numerical Aperture applications). Our proposed approach showcases its effectiveness through both quantitative and qualitative analyses.", "We improve and generalize bounds on the parameter $\\lambda$ in distance-regular graphs compared to bounds for strongly regular graphs by Spielman (1996) and Pyber (2014). The new bound contributes to recent advances in testing isomorphism of strongly regular graphs (Babai, Chen, Sun, Teng, Wilmes 2013). The proof relies on a clique geometry by Metsch (1991) subject to certain constraints on the parameters. We also offer a simplified proof of an asymptotic consequence of Metsch's result: when $k\\mu = o(\\lambda^2)$, each edge of $G$ is part of a single maximal clique of size approximately $\\lambda$, while all other cliques are of size $o(\\lambda)$. Metsch's cliques become \"asymptotically Delsarte\" when $k\\mu = o(\\lambda^2)$, making families of distance-regular graphs with parameters satisfying $k\\mu = o(\\lambda^2)$ \"asymptotically Delsarte-geometric.\"", "Recent galaxy observations have shown that star formation activity varies depending on different environments within galaxies. Understanding how giant molecular clouds form and evolve in extreme environments is essential to comprehend the diversity of star formation on a galactic scale. Our focus is on investigating observational evidence indicating that strongly barred galaxies lack massive stars despite having sufficient molecular gas to support star formation. In our study, we conducted a simulation of a strongly barred galaxy, utilizing a stellar potential based on observations of NGC1300. We compared the properties of molecular clouds in different galactic regions, such as the bar, bar-end, and spiral arms. Our findings reveal that the average virial parameter of clouds is approximately 1 and does not show dependence on the environment, suggesting that a cloud's gravitational bound state does not explain the absence of massive stars in strong bars. Instead, we shifted our focus to cloud-cloud collisions, which have been proposed as a potential mechanism for triggering massive star formation. Our analysis indicates that collision speeds are faster in the bar region compared to other regions, with fast collisions potentially resulting from the elliptical gas orbits perturbed by the bar potential. These results imply that the lack of active star formation in strongly barred regions may stem from inefficient cloud-cloud collisions, influenced by the violent gas motion on a galactic scale.", "Revised text:\n\n**Context:** The relationship between the mass and metallicity of star-forming galaxies, known as the mass-metallicity relationship (MMR), is a well-established concept. However, there is ongoing debate regarding the precise shape of this relationship and whether it may be influenced by other observational factors.\n\n**Aims:** Our goal is to quantify the MMR within the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. By comparing our findings with those from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we aim to investigate how the MMR may vary based on different selection criteria, seeking to identify potential sources of discrepancies noted in previous studies.\n\n**Methods:** To determine oxygen abundances, we employ strong emission line ratio diagnostics. We apply various selection criteria related to signal-to-noise ratios in different emission lines, as well as apparent and absolute magnitudes, to explore how these factors impact the inferred MMR.\n\n**Results:** The shape and position of the MMR show notable variations depending on the chosen metallicity calibration and selection criteria. Following the adoption of a reliable metallicity calibration, we observe a reasonably consistent mass-metallicity relation between redshifts 0.061 and 0.35 in the GAMA survey compared to the SDSS, despite differing luminosity ranges analyzed.\n\n**Conclusions:** Considering the substantial differences in the MMR resulting from reasonable alterations in sample selection criteria and methods, we advise caution when directly comparing MMR data from diverse surveys and studies. Our analysis also suggests a potential minor evolution within the GAMA sample over the redshift range of 0.06 to 0.35.", "Based on thermodynamic analysis, we establish a series of equations that connect the flow velocities of different fluid components in two-phase flow through porous media that are immiscible and incompressible. These equations require introducing a novel velocity function known as the co-moving velocity, which is specific to the porous medium. By incorporating a relationship between velocities and driving forces, like pressure gradients, these equations form a self-contained system. We employ this theory to analytically solve four variations of the capillary tube model and further validate it through numerical testing on a network model.", "The remarkable creativity found in nature, as seen through the wide range of forms and functions in living organisms, sets life apart from nonliving entities. It is no surprise that this characteristic has become a key focus of interest in the field of artificial life. By understanding that diversity results from the continuous process of evolution, recognized as Open-Ended Evolution (OEE), researchers aim to mimic this phenomenon in artificial systems. This article introduces the second of two special issues dedicated to current research on OEE, highlighting the content within. The research discussed stems from a workshop on open-ended evolution held during the 2018 Conference on Artificial Life in Tokyo, building upon previous insights gained from workshops in Cancun and York. By presenting a simplified classification of OEE and summarizing the advancements conveyed in this special issue, the progress in this field is showcased.", "We checked out some really cool stuff on ultrathin films made of MgO/Ag(001) with Mg atoms mixed in the metal layer at the interface. We did experiments using Auger electron diffraction, ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy, and some fancy density functional theory (DFT) calculations. By carefully examining the Auger spectra, we figured out the distances between layers and the shape of the MgO/Ag(001) system when there are Mg atoms at the interface compared to when there are none. Turns out, adding Mg atoms causes a big change in the structure of the interface layers and lowers the work function by 0.5 eV due to shifts in the bands at the interface.\n\nOur cool experimental results match up nicely with the DFT calculations we did, showing us how the lattice gets distorted with more Mg and how there is an electron transfer from Mg to Ag atoms in the metal layer. The distortion happens because of the attraction (or repulsion) between the O2- ions and the charged Mg (Ag) atoms nearby. This makes the work function go down a bit, but not by much. We tried to break down the changes in the work function caused by adding Mg atoms by looking at charge transfer, rumpling, and electrostatic compression, and we realized that the main reason is the increase in electrostatic compression effect. Cool stuff, right?", "The importance of keeping an eye on industrial processes, to spot any changes and fix issues quickly, is an interesting topic. It gets even trickier when the measured value is too low for the system to detect or falls below its limits, leading to incomplete observations or what we call left-censored data. When censorship is high, like above 70%, traditional monitoring methods don't work well. That's when we need to use specific statistical techniques to analyze data properly and know what's really going on in the process. This paper suggests a method to estimate process parameters in these situations and introduces a control chart through a detailed algorithm.", "In many data-driven application areas, clustering plays a crucial role and has been extensively researched in terms of distance computations and clustering algorithms. However, there has been limited focus on developing representations for clustering. This paper introduces Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC), a technique that learns feature representations and cluster assignments simultaneously through deep neural networks. DEC aims to map data into a lower-dimensional feature space where it optimizes a clustering objective iteratively. Experimental results on image and text datasets demonstrate a notable enhancement over existing methods.", "We took a closer look at a study done by Sarvotham et al. in 2005, which talked about how the peak transmission rate affects network burstiness. We grouped packets together based on a few characteristics to see how they behave in sessions. These sessions are defined by a 5-tuple: the total payload, duration, average transmission rate, peak transmission rate, and initiation time. We realized that we needed a new way to define peak rate after some thought.\n\nUnlike the study by Sarvotham et al., where they divided sessions into alpha and beta groups, we split ours into 10 groups depending on the peak rate values. This helped us see that the beta group was not as consistent as we thought. By doing this, we found more details that were missed when we only had two groups. We looked at how the characteristics (total payload, duration, average transmission rate) varied across these groups.\n\nWe also noticed that the session initiation times followed a pattern similar to a Poisson process within each group, unlike the dataset overall. This led us to believe that the peak rate plays a crucial role in understanding network structure and in making accurate data simulations. We suggest a simple way to simulate network traffic based on our discoveries.", "The Brouwer fixed-point theorem in topology says that any continuous mapping $f$ on a compact convex set has a fixed point (such as $f(x_0) = x_0). This fixed point can correspond to the throat of a traversable wormhole if certain conditions are met. Essentially, the existence of wormholes can be inferred from mathematical analysis without needing to exceed current physical principles.", "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently been utilized in computer vision and medical image analysis for problem-solving. Despite their popularity, most techniques can only process 2D images, whereas much of the medical data used in clinical settings consists of 3D volumes. Our work presents a novel approach to 3D image segmentation using a volumetric, fully convolutional neural network trained end-to-end on MRI volumes of the prostate. The CNN predicts segmentations for entire volumes simultaneously. We propose a unique objective function based on the Dice coefficient that we optimize during training to address imbalances between foreground and background voxels. To overcome limitations in annotated training data, we augment our dataset with random non-linear transformations and histogram matching. Experimental results demonstrate our method achieves high performance on challenging test data with significantly reduced processing time compared to previous methods.", "In simple terms, a non-relativistic two-body system interacts through the Coulomb potential. The system has a spectrum known as the Balmer series, given by the equation $E_n=\\frac{\\alpha^2m}{4n^2}$ from the Schr\\\"odinger equation. In 1954, Wick and Cutkosky discovered that when the interaction strength $\\alpha$ is greater than $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$, relativistic effects lead to the creation of new energy levels beyond the Balmer series. The nature of these new states was unclear and questioned by researchers, until a recent study revealed that the additional states are mainly influenced by massless exchange particles moving at the speed of light. This is why they were not accounted for in the non-relativistic Schr\\\"odinger framework.", "Our research focuses on exploring the basic characteristics of the quantum f-relative entropy, where f(.) represents an operator convex function. We establish the equality conditions under the principles of monotonicity and joint convexity, demonstrating their broader applicability compared to previously known conditions. In particular, these conditions apply to a variety of operator convex functions, including the case of f(t) = -ln(t). The quantum f-entropy is introduced as a means of quantifying the quantum f-relative entropy, and we investigate its properties while also identifying the circumstances under which equality holds. Furthermore, we analyze how the f-generalizations of the Holevo information, the entanglement-assisted capacity, and the coherent information adhere to the data processing inequality. We also determine the equality conditions for the f-coherent information.", "Altering an image through translation or rotation typically has no impact on the outcomes of many computer vision tasks. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are already able to handle translations effectively by producing equivalent feature map translations, rotations present a different challenge. While global rotation equivariance is often achieved through data augmentation, patch-wise equivariance is more complex. To address this, we introduce Harmonic Networks or H-Nets, which use circular harmonics in place of standard CNN filters to achieve equivariance to both patch-wise translation and full 360-degree rotation. H-Nets provide a parameter-efficient representation with low computational complexity, allowing deep feature maps to encode complex rotational invariants. These layers are designed to be compatible with modern techniques like deep supervision and batch normalization, leading to state-of-the-art performance on rotated-MNIST classification and competitive results on various benchmark tasks.", "We delve into the fascinating world of observing reflection spectra in waveguide-cavity systems as they couple directly. The enigmatic Fano lines we uncover shed light on the intricate dance of reflection and coupling unfolding before our eyes. Unlike their side-coupled counterparts, our observed Fano line shapes are not dictated by the waveguide's ends, but rather by the enchanting interplay between our measurement device fiber and the waveguide itself.\n\nThrough a blend of experimental findings and analytical insights, we unveil the remarkable sensitivity of the Fano parameter in delineating these captivating line shapes. Surprisingly, a mere adjustment in the fiber positioning - even below the Rayleigh range - has the power to dramatically reshape the Fano line before us.", "Measuring atmospheric turbulence is crucial for optical and infrared telescopes to perform well. A new technique involves capturing short-exposure images of a star field with a small telescope. By analyzing the motion differences between pairs of star images, we can determine the effects of turbulence on the wavefront tilt. The technique uses Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo optimization to compare the observations with theoretical turbulence models. This method can estimate the turbulence profile, atmospheric seeing conditions, and outer scale. Monte-Carlo simulations have been conducted to validate the technique, and examples from the second AST3 telescope in Antarctica are provided.", "An n-plectic structure is defined as a commutative and torsionless Lie Rinehart pair, accompanied by a distinguished cocycle from its Chevalley-Eilenberg complex. This 'n-plectic cocycle' leads to an extension of the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex by symplectic tensors. The cohomology of this extension extends Hamiltonian functions and vector fields to tensors and cotensors in various degrees, accounting for certain coboundaries, and exhibits the structure of a Lie oo-algebra. Notably, momentum maps emerge as weak Lie oo-morphisms from any Lie oo-algebra into the Lie oo-algebra of Hamiltonian (co)tensors in this framework.", "In more casual terms, glasses and amorphous solids are known to show a slow decay in a few properties over time, like how long it takes for light to scatter, the way they relax electrically, or how they bounce back over time. This happens a lot around the glass transition point. I'll explain how, using the example of electric relaxation. When we rethink the Lorentz model of electric materials in a different way, we can describe the electric response by looking at how much the particles in the material vibrate. It turns out that, close to the glass transition (which is also when the material changes the way it can stretch), the electric relaxation follows a particular pattern with values between 0.56 to 0.65. This range is what most experiments find. And surprisingly, this slow decay can be tied to certain modes in the way the material's particles vibrate.", "Examining the struggles of achieving representation disentanglement in the text domain under unsupervised conditions, this paper opts to showcase a curated collection of successful models utilized in the realm of images. The assessment covers these models across six disentanglement metrics, in addition to tasks like downstream classification and homotopy. To streamline this evaluation process, two synthetic datasets featuring well-known generative factors are introduced. The findings underscore a distinct disparity within the text domain, emphasizing elements such as representation sparsity and potential coupling with the decoder as influential factors on disentanglement. Notably, this work pioneers the convergence of unsupervised representation disentanglement with text representations, offering an experimental foundation and datasets for future explorations in this area.", "This paper introduces a groundbreaking hybrid quantum-classical algorithm designed to tackle the challenging power system problem known as unit commitment (UC). By breaking down the UC problem into a series of subproblems, including a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) subproblem, and utilizing both classical optimization solvers and the cutting-edge quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), this algorithm offers a novel approach to addressing complex optimization tasks. Employing a three-block alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm to coordinate the subproblems, simulation results conducted on Qiskit via the IBM Q system underscore the effectiveness of this innovative algorithm in solving the UC problem.", "It has been suggested that the detection of numerous low-amplitude modes in Delta Sct stars was solely due to the signal-to-noise ratio. Accessing this valuable information, which is impossible from the ground, is one of the scientific goals of the space mission CoRoT, developed and operated by CNES. This study presents the results obtained from HD 50844: we analyzed a total of 140,016 data points using different methods and conducted several checks. The amplitude spectra of the CoRoT time series reached a level of 10^{-5} mag. Frequency analysis identified hundreds of terms ranging from 0 to 30 d^{-1} in the CoRoT time series. All cross-checks confirmed this new finding, supporting the initial belief that Delta Sct stars exhibit a diverse frequency content. Spectroscopic mode identification provided theoretical backing by identifying very high-degree modes (up to ell=14). We also demonstrated that cancellation effects are insufficient to remove flux variations associated with these modes at the noise level of CoRoT measurements. Ground-based observations indicated that HD 50844 is an evolved star slightly underabundant in heavy elements, positioned on the Terminal Age Main Sequence. Due to this evolutionary status, no clear regular frequency distribution was observed. The dominant term (f_1=6.92 d^{-1}) corresponds to the fundamental radial mode, and this was identified by combining ground-based photometric and spectroscopic data. This study is based on observations conducted with ESO telescopes within the ESO Large Programme LP178.D-0361 and on data collected from Observatorio de Sierra Nevada, Observatorio Astronomico Nacional San Pedro Martir, and Piszkesteto Mountain Station of Konkoly Observatory.", "The article discusses studying star-forming regions S231-S235 in a giant cloud known as G174+2.5. The researchers examined these regions using specific lines of ammonia, cyanoacetylene, methanol, and water vapor. They identified high-density gas in two molecular clumps, WB89 673 and WB89 668, by detecting ammonia and cyanoacetylene lines. The study also estimated the temperature and density of the gas in these clumps. Additionally, a new discovery was made in detecting a specific molecule (CH$_3$OH) line towards WB89 673.", "We present groundbreaking measurements of gamma-ray burst (GRB) 171205A using the upgraded uGMRT at frequencies ranging from 250 to 1450 MHz over 4-937 days. This GRB marks the first afterglow detected at 250-500 MHz and is the second brightest GRB observed with the uGMRT. Despite an almost 1000-day observation period, no transition to a non-relativistic regime is evident. Analysis of archival Chandra X-ray data on days ~70 and ~200 also reveals no jet break. Our study indicates a synchrotron afterglow emission from relativistic, isotropic, self-similar deceleration and a shock-breakout from a wide-angle cocoon. Deviating from a standard constant density medium, the density profile suggests an explosion in a stratified wind-like medium. These findings underscore the importance of low-frequency measurements in uncovering the GRB environment. Combined data suggest radio afterglow contributions from a slightly off-axis jet and a wider cocoon, consistent with previous studies.", "The new theory of quasi-Lie schemes is used to study Emden equations, resulting in t-dependent constants of the motion. Previously known results are revisited and new findings for Emden equations are presented.", "In our investigation, we explore the charged Higgs bosons projected by the model incorporating gauge symmetry $SU(3)_c \\otimes SU(3)_L \\otimes U(1)_X$. By examining the Yukawa mixing couplings across varying scales, ranging from small ($\\sim$ GeV) to large ($\\sim$ TeV) values, we demonstrate that both the hypercharge-one $H_1^{\\pm}$ and hypercharge-two $H_2^{\\pm}$ Higgs bosons anticipated by the model can be concurrently generated in $pp$ collisions, albeit at different production rates. The $H_1^{\\pm}$ bosons portray akin characteristics to the charged Higgs bosons from a two Higgs doublet model (2HDM) at lower energies. In contrast, the $H_2^{\\pm}$ bosons represent additional like-charged Higgs bosons arising from the fundamental 3-3-1 model. Consequently, the identification of multiple like-charged Higgs boson resonances holds the potential to evaluate the alignment of theoretical frameworks with empirical evidence. Our analysis delves into the $H_{1,2}^{\\pm}$ pair and the corresponding $tbH_{1,2}^{\\pm}$ productions at the CERN LHC collider. Notably, our findings suggest that pair production might be comparable in magnitude to single production in gluon-gluon collisions due to the involvement of a massive neutral $Z'$ gauge boson envisaged by the model. Our consideration of decays to leptons, $H_{1,2}^{\\pm} \\rightarrow \\tau \\nu_{\\tau}$, reveals scenarios where minor peaks of $H_{2}^{\\pm}$-boson events within transverse mass distributions could be distinguished atop the $H_{1}^{\\pm}$ background.", "The discussion on isospin breaking in the $K_{\\ell 4}$ form factors, arising from the difference between charged and neutral pion masses, occurs within a framework founded on suitably subtracted dispersion representations. By iteratively constructing the $K_{\\ell 4}$ form factors up to two loops in the low-energy expansion, the analyticity, crossing, and unitarity are implemented through two-meson intermediate states. This process yields analytical expressions for the phases of the two-loop form factors of the $K^\\pm\\to\\pi^+\\pi^- e^\\pm \\nu_e$ channel, facilitating the connection between experimentally measured form-factor phase shift differences (beyond the isospin limit) and the disparity of $S$- and $P$-wave $\\pi\\pi$ phase shifts (examined theoretically within the isospin limit). Notably, the dependence on the two $S$-wave scattering lengths $a_0^0$ and $a_0^2$ in the isospin limit is systematically determined, in contrast to earlier analyses relying on one-loop chiral perturbation theory. Furthermore, a reanalysis of results from the NA48/2 collaboration at the CERN SPS includes isospin-breaking corrections to derive values for the scattering lengths $a_0^0$ and $a_0^2$ within the context of the phases of the $K^\\pm\\to\\pi^+\\pi^- e^\\pm \\nu_e$ form factors.", "In this paper, we build upon the findings from previous works \\cite{1,2,3,4}, particularly emphasizing the insights provided in \\cite{4}, to delve into a statistical exploration of the cosmological constant within a cosmological de Sitter universe. Through our investigation, we aim to shed light on how massless excitations with Planckian effects contribute to characterizing this fundamental constant.\n\nInitially, we explore the implications at a classical level, revealing that a positive cosmological constant $\\Lambda>0$ is only achievable as the temperature $T$ approaches zero. By drawing parallels with the behavior in black hole scenarios, our analysis delves into the role of quantum effects in deriving an expression for $\\Lambda based on massless excitations. Notably, this representation hinges on factoring in quantum corrections to the Misner-Sharp mass.\n\nMoreover, by accounting for quantum fluctuations, we unveil the emergence of an effective cosmological constant that varies with the scale being observed. This phenomenon offers a potential resolution to the cosmological constant enigma without necessitating the introduction of a quintessence field. The minute value typically associated with $\\Lambda$ may be attributed to the presence of a quantum decoherence scale beyond the Planck length. Consequently, the evolution of spacetime manifests as a pristine de Sitter universe housing a minutely averaged cosmological constant firmly embedded in its lowest energy state.", "We study zero and finite temperature properties of the one-dimensional spin-glass model for vector spins with an infinite number of spin components, where interactions decay with a power, \u03c3, of the distance. A diluted version of the model is also examined, showing significant deviation from the fully connected model. At zero temperature, defect energies are determined from the difference in ground-state energies between systems with periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions, revealing the dependence of the defect-energy exponent \u03b8 on \u03c3. The relation found is \u03b8 = 3/4 - \u03c3. This indicates that the upper critical value of \u03c3 is 3/4, corresponding to the lower critical dimension in the d-dimensional short-range model. For finite temperatures, the large m saddle-point equations are self-consistently solved, providing information on the correlation function, order parameter, and spin-glass susceptibility. Special emphasis is placed on the various forms of finite-size scaling effects below and above the lower critical value, \u03c3 = 5/8, which represents the upper critical dimension 8 of the hypercubic short-range model.", "The rare Of^+ supergiants have traits that fall between regular O-stars and Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. They share key features with WN-type objects, especially in the visible and near-infrared ranges, showing similarities in their stellar wind behaviors. Our study looks at the first X-ray observations of HD16691 (O4If^+) and HD14947 (O5f^+), which display a soft thermal spectrum typical of X-ray emissions from single O-type stars. Interestingly, the X-ray brightness of these stars is slightly lower than expected, hinting at their unique stellar wind properties influencing their X-ray emissions as they transition towards the WR category. We suggest that the reduced X-ray brightness of HD16691 and HD14947 is a reflection of their intermediate status between O and WR stars, possibly due to denser stellar winds.", "The AARTFAAC project is aiming to create a device called an All-Sky Monitor (ASM) using the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) telescope. This device will continuously look for low frequency radio signals in the sky that can last from milliseconds to several days. When it detects a signal, it will quickly begin more in-depth observations using the full LOFAR telescope. There are some challenges in making this happen, such as imaging the entire sky, processing data quickly, keeping the device running all the time, and making sure it works automatically. The equipment needed for the ASM is very large and will handle a lot of data very quickly. Test observations have been done to make sure the ASM will work as intended. This paper gives an overview of how the AARTFAAC data will be processed and shows some test images to highlight the challenges the project is facing.", "Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars represent the evolved descendants of massive O-type stars and are deemed as potential progenitor candidates for Type Ib/c core-collapse supernovae (SNe). The recent findings of our survey utilizing the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field Camera 3 (HST/WFC3) on Wolf-Rayet stars in M101 are summarized by evaluating the efficacy of narrow-band optical imaging vis-\u00e0-vis broad-band techniques. It is demonstrated that, on average, 42% of WR stars, rising to approximately 85% in central regions, can only be identified through narrow-band imaging. Consequently, the absence of a WR star's detection in approximately 10 Type Ib/c SNe locations within broad-band imaging no longer serves as conclusive evidence against a WR progenitor pathway."]
