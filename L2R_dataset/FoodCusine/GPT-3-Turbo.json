Mixing a bit of wet food with her dry kibble seems to be a hit with my golden companion. I enjoy switching up the flavors during mealtimes to keep things interesting, as I believe having the same dish daily could become monotonous. I do avoid the fish variety though, primarily because of the smell it emits.\n\nMoreover, my decision to shift to purchasing from Amazon was prompted by Petco's limited supply of wet food, having only a few cans available.

This particular food has been incredibly effective in reducing allergies, and our dog absolutely enjoys it. Endorsed by RAMSEY FrAnkenSteiN.", "During the summer when we adopted our English Bulldog at 3 years old, he struggled with skin sensitivities. Our vet advised transitioning him away from his former diet of Iams Lamb and Rice to a different option. After experimenting with a couple of choices, we found a new food that has been a game-changer. Specifically formulated for dogs with dietary restrictions and allergies, this food is ideal for those who react to typical additives and proteins in commercial pet food such as chicken or beef.", "My Golden Retriever absolutely despised this food \u2013 refusing to eat it and suffering from severe diarrhea when he did. We won't purchase it again due to both its high cost and negative impact on our dog.", "The mouth says, \"How much do I love you? Let me count the ways...\"<br />If you're a fan of apple products, this is a must-have item. The only downside is the shipping cost, since these items are quite heavy.", "The item arrived partially thawed, which my parents were not willing to accept. Nonetheless, the company provided excellent support and granted a full refund.", "The crust on these tarts is absolutely perfect! My husband adores them, and my kids think they're amazing. While they might be a tad too sour/tart for my liking, I still love indulging in the delicious crust. It seems like everyone in my family is raving about them!", "These are undeniably delicious! Both my husband and I thoroughly enjoy them. However, as another customer has pointed out, the shipping charges are exorbitant. The cost of shipping exceeds that of the tartlets themselves.", "This delightful treat is a perfect twist on classic apple pie - no slicing or dicing required! With its easy preparation and ability to make fresh batches whenever craving strikes, it's a must-try.", "I enjoy Creme Brulee because it is easy to make. Just sprinkle the included sugar and broil it. It looks and tastes great. My guests thought I put a lot of effort into making them, but it only took 5 minutes. I will be ordering more!", "This exceeded my expectations in light of the company's renowned reputation for outstanding home delivery products.", "I discovered pickled asparagus at an Amish market and loved it. So, when I found them on sale at Safeway, I bought them all. They are better than the ones from the Amish market, with some even containing a bonus clove of garlic. I will be ordering a six-pack even though I live alone because they are that good and won't go to waste.", "I love asparagus! I had never tried pickled asparagus until just recently. Let me tell you, when my friend brought out this brand, I was blown away by how delicious it was. I enjoyed it so much that I ended up buying the six-pack. Now I only have 2 jars left. Looks like I'll have to stock up soon!", "Currently, I am following a diet and recently visited my local Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Grocery store to explore diet-friendly food options. I was seeking tasty, non-fat, and low-calorie items, and ended up purchasing about twelve products. During this shopping trip, I stumbled upon Tillen Farms Pickled Crispy Asparagus, which caught my attention. As a fan of asparagus and pickled vegetables in general, I have tried several brands before, but Tillen Farms stands out as exceptionally delicious. The asparagus has a wonderful flavor, and I am excited about the large garlic clove at the bottom of the jar. Surprisingly, each jar is only 60 calories, making it a top choice for my diet menu.", "I did not enjoy the flavor and texture of this mix. Generally, I like most of the Low Carb products I have tried, but this specific one let me down.", "I have been consuming this tea for an extended period. Previously, I would procure it exclusively from a medical facility since it was not easily accessible elsewhere. I am pleased to note that I now have the convenience of purchasing it from Amazon.com. I incorporate this tea into my daily routine, akin to how others may engage with coffee. It boasts a delightful flavor profile.", "I have been enjoying Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea, which comes in packs of 100 tea bags weighing 2g each, as my go-to daily tea for a number of years now. To save on shipping costs, I purchase 12 boxes at a time. Previously, I used to consume coffee throughout the day, but eventually realized that excessive coffee intake was impacting my health negatively. Consequently, I made the decision to prioritize my well-being and completely gave up coffee. In my search for a suitable replacement, I discovered that not only does green tea offer a pleasant taste, but it also boasts numerous health benefits. Unlike other beverages, green tea is known to contribute positively to one's health, with the exception being high-quality cold water. In my experience, Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea stands out as one of the most delicious options available at its price range. With its lovely golden hue and fresh, vibrant flavor, it has become a staple in my collection. For those looking to add sweetness and extra health benefits, I suggest incorporating a small amount of Y.S. Organic Bee Farms RAW HONEY into the tea. While I do indulge in a more expensive tea, Tribute Xi Hu Long Jing, occasionally as a treat, it is not a practical choice for everyday consumption due to its cost. \n\nIn terms of drawbacks, my latest order differed from the product displayed on the Amazon page. The package I received indicates that the tea is \"NATURALLY HIGH IN POLYPHENOL CATECHINS,\" which are known to potentially contribute to the health benefits of tea, while the Amazon listing states \"CAFFEINE FREE.\" This discrepancy has left me uncertain about whether the green tea is caffeine-free or not. Additionally, I have encountered issues where the tea bags tear open when I try to unwrap the string tied around them. In such cases, I remedy the situation by placing the bag in hot water to loosen the string.", "This tea is one of the best I've ever tasted. It's clean, bright, and fresh. The delivery was great, and the quality is top-notch. You should definitely give it a try.", "I really enjoy this green tea, which is difficult to find locally and often expensive online. However, I was able to get a good deal on multiple boxes from this seller. I am very satisfied with my purchase and will definitely order from them again. Green tea is a daily must-have for me.", "I adore this tea as it effectively suppresses my appetite throughout the day. My mother and I have graciously shared it with all our friends for them to experience.", "I am Italian and resided in Italy for several years. I would purchase these cookies regularly for my morning breakfast along with an authentic Italian espresso. I searched everywhere in the Bay area but couldn't find them, so I am delighted to enjoy them once more.", "I spent numerous summers in Italy during the 1980s and discovered this biscotti, which was commonly enjoyed as a morning meal or afternoon treat. Back then, they were not readily available in the US, but luckily, I brought two bags back from my recent visit to Italy. It's wonderful to see that they are now accessible on Amazon! Opening a bag, savoring the aroma, pouring a glass of milk, and dipping the Macines in it make for a delightful routine and a special treat for children.", "I heard about this product from the local pet store and decided to give it a try for our two cats, who are around 3 and 6 years old. The younger female cat loved it right away, while the older male cat, who had been raised on not-so-great cat food filled with corn meal, surprisingly took a liking to it too. He's a bit plump, and we were advised by the vet to switch him to soft food, which he refused until we found this one. He's a fancy cat, after all! Although he still eats a lot, at least I know he's getting quality food. Yes, this product may cost more than others, but I'd rather pay extra for something I trust than settle for low-quality options that claim to be healthy. Why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet filled with corn meal? Doesn't seem right, does it? For now, I'll stick with this product, but who knows what the future holds.\n\nUpdating this review after 9 months of using this cat food for our feline duo. I've bumped up my rating from 4 to 5 stars because it has truly been great for both of them. Garfield still eats a bit too much, but hey, he's a big guy who's not into exercise, let's be real. Our female cat is turning 4 soon and she's the picture of health - tiny, happy, and agile. I tried the chicken flavor of Holistic Select, but Garfield seemed to prefer this sardine one, so we switched back. I've also ordered the duck version and will update once they've given it a taste test.", "I began purchasing this product when I noticed my 1-year-old cat was starting to lose his energy. I felt it was time to upgrade to high-quality cat food from the pet store, rather than the options at regular supermarkets. Among the plethora of choices available, I selected this brand to give it a try, and it turned out to be an excellent decision. After feeding this to my cat for the last 8 months, he is now as playful as he was in his kitten days, and his fur has grown remarkably soft. Notably, he absolutely loves the taste! I enthusiastically recommend this brand to my friends and family for their pets.", "I conducted extensive research to discover the most suitable food for my cat, and I can confidently say that this particular food is exceptional. It comes highly recommended by my holistic veterinarian as well. What sets it apart is the inclusion of probiotics on the kibble itself, a crucial aspect for me. The most remarkable aspect is that my cat took to it right away; she enjoyed it so much that I had to discontinue mixing it with her previous food as she only wanted to eat Holistic Select.", "My vet suggested this cat food for my 13-year-old Cleo Cat who was having a hard time keeping anything down and was losing weight. And guess what - it did the trick! She's not eating as much as before, but she seems more content after meals, which makes the higher price worth it. Plus, it works wonders for her digestion - no more unpleasant scents, if you catch my drift. Had to mention it so folks with similar cat issues know there are some serious perks to this food.", "\"My lively 4-year-old tomcat is a champion of battles against chronic urinary tract infections! To keep him in tip-top shape, I mix his dry food with wet food enhanced with water, and a dash of Uri Ease. This winning combo works wonders in keeping his UTIs at bay. I've noticed whenever I try a different dry food option, his UTIs flare up like fireworks! Not only does my fur baby benefit from this special diet, but our other feline companions can't get enough of it too. Though it may be a bit pricey, it's a small price to pay for their health and happiness!\"", "Previously, I did not have knowledge about feline nutrition and inadvertently let my cats develop a dependence on dry cat food. Although I always provided both canned and dry food options, I now realize the importance of feeding them premium quality canned food and limiting their dry food intake. I am the pet parent of two 15-year-old cats and two 5-year-old cats. The only dry foods of good quality that they enjoy are Wellness and Innova. Recently, Innova was acquired by Procter & Gamble, prompting me to search for a suitable replacement. After trying various samples provided by my local holistic pet store, I found that Holistic Select was the only alternative, aside from the usual Wellness and Innova, that they would eat. For cats with discerning taste preferences, I suggest considering Holistic Select. This brand offers high-quality food that appeals to finicky eaters.", "My holistic veterinarian has graciously suggested this particular brand, among several others. After exploring various options, my feline companions have unequivocally shown a preference for this selection, particularly the sardine variant. I am delighted to witness the transformation in their fur, which has become remarkably soft and clean, and their eyes that gleam with clarity. Furthermore, I have observed that their elimination process has noticeably reduced in odor, a marked improvement over the results seen in cats consuming mainstream, low-quality products. The evident health advantages are compelling, leading me to wholeheartedly endorse Holistic Select.", "One of my felines is intolerant to fish and beef. This particular formula is among the limited options suitable for her consumption, boasting superior ingredients compared to the prescribed diets obtainable at the veterinarian. Both of my beloved cats exhibit great agility, possess lustrous coats, and maintain a healthy weight. Furthermore, the consumption of dry food aids in diminishing tartar accumulation on their teeth.", "Our feline friends absolutely love this dry cat food, leading to fewer hairball incidents and healthier, lustrous fur. They have maintained a perfect weight and top-notch fitness. The vendor's ultra-fast shipping service has truly impressed us, making them one of our favorite Amazon suppliers!", "I have been a dedicated enthusiast of the zesty Hot & Spicy Maruchan Ramen for quite some time now. If you appreciate heat and have a passion for ramen, this particular product is sure to captivate your taste buds. It's a pity that the price point on Amazon is remarkably high; however, I am pleased to report that it is available for just $3.36 for a pack of twelve at my local Walmart.", "I've been eating Ramen noodles ever since I was a kid, and out of all the flavors I've tried, Hot & Spicy Chicken is still my favorite! Even though it's not very spicy for someone who loves chili, it's just so delicious!", "I'm OBSESSED with spicy ramen! But man, this stuff lights a FIRE in my stomach and the burning sensation lasts for a good 3 HOURS! Is that even good for me? And guess what? You can snag it at Walmart for just $0.28, a STEAL compared to Amazon!", "Being a fan of ramen for its convenience, coming across it on Amazon at a good price and having it delivered in bulk to your doorstep is a fantastic opportunity for anyone.", "I must confess to a certain sensitivity, for this soup carries a heat akin to what one might attribute to fire itself. While I generally appreciate spiciness when accompanied by robust flavors, this particular offering seems to lack such harmony. The overpowering burn eclipses any potential for nuanced taste profiles.", "I enjoyed the spicy taste of these noodles. Surprisingly, I preferred the broth over the noodles, contrary to my usual preference. If you're not accustomed to spiciness, this dish might be too much for you. On the other hand, if you enjoy very spicy food, this may not be spicy enough for your liking.", "I snagged these for just 25 cents a cup on sale - that's half the price I usually pay at my local grocery stores! On top of that, they hardly ever have the spicy flavors in stock. These are the perfect quick snack for my busy office days when there's no time for a proper meal. This Instant Lunch flavor is definitely one of my top picks, and I'll keep coming back for more every time it's on sale!", "I have purchased a variety of flavors, but this one stands out as a personal favorite! I'll definitely be stocking up on more of these soon.", "I'm absolutely obsessed with this ramen flavor! It's so delicious that other ramen flavors just don't cut it for me anymore - they taste way too bland in comparison. Thanks to my Prime membership, I can have it delivered straight to my door in just two days without any extra shipping costs. Although the price on Amazon is reasonable, I still find it more cost-effective to make a quick trip to the store to grab a case of my favorite ramen.", "The greatest investment I've ever made is in this ginger! It's truly incredible - fibrous like fresh ginger with a spicy kick that pairs perfectly with sugar to create a harmonious balance. Spending $40 on 5lbs of it was absolutely worth it! I'll definitely be purchasing more soon, as I love using this ginger as a delicious topping for my ginger cupcakes and cookies.", "This ginger is delicious. It's hard to find Australian ginger where I live, but this one is just as good as what I've bought in other cities. I'm glad I can now enjoy it without having to travel.", "I have tried other cheaper brands, but I realize that this ginger is definitely worth the money. It is tender, moist, and never disappoints.", "My child has been experiencing acid reflux from the time of birth and has tried every medicine possible without any progress. Then, an elderly man at his workplace shared this product with him, and I immediately purchased it. I didn't anticipate better outcomes compared to the numerous other remedies we had attempted. To my amazement, from the second day of consuming a piece of this Ginger each morning, he has not experienced any heartburn or symptoms. Now, he can savor any food with pleasure. This item truly was a blessing for him. I am grateful to all involved in creating it!", "I purchased this for our office to offer people a sweet snack option. Its bite-size pieces make it convenient for individuals to grab a few pieces rather than a whole licorice stick. My only issue is that one of the bags tore open during shipping.", "Twizzlers brand licorice reigns supreme over its well-known competitor! \ud83c\udf1f Snag a package for just $2 to $2.50, shipping included, and you've got yourself a sweet steal. \ud83d\ude0b While the black and cherry flavors pack a flavorful punch, the subtle strawberry taste might leave you wanting more. \ud83c\udf53", "I absolutely adore these delectable treats! In fact, I believe I'm utterly addicted to them.<br />Purchasing them in packs of 6 bags is not only a smart choice but a cost-effective one compared to buying single bags at Target. The savings amount to about $1.00 per bag! I rely on subscribe and save for these and many other products. The convenience and benefits of subscribe and save simply astound me!", "Looking for a cleaner alternative to licorice for the kids? Give these a try! They're soft, chewy, and won't leave your hands sticky when you're on the go - whether in the car, at the beach, or during the summer. We enjoy the various flavors and sometimes pair them with chocolate for a delightful snack. Excellent product, budget-friendly, definitely a must-try!", "The pieces in this bag seem to have been purposely shrunk in size, most likely to create the illusion of getting a greater quantity at a better price. Unfortunately, this minimization compromises the flavor intensity of each piece, requiring you to consume 2 or 3 to equal the original size. This significant change undermines the quality of your eating experience.", "I have been a fan of Newman's Pineapple salsa for a long time and recently sought a similar alternative. The Berry Mango salsa I found is one of the most delicious salsas I have ever tried. My daughters also enjoy it due to its smooth texture with small mango pieces. This salsa strikes the perfect balance of sweetness and mild heat, making it a great value at its price point.", "The salsa emitted a delightful aroma, suggesting its high quality. Unfortunately, upon inspection, it was revealed that the packaging lacked sufficient protection, resulting in breakage of the bottoms of all three bottles. When I sought to address this issue by inquiring about a return, I was informed that food items are non-returnable. Subsequently, my attempt to locate customer service details on the company's redesigned website proved futile. While the company evidently takes pride in its new image, it is essential for them to provide a readily accessible point of contact for urgent matters. For instance, as a frequent purchaser of items, such as glass containers, that necessitate careful handling, it is imperative that proper packaging is employed. Utilizing a cardboard box with minimal protective measures, like a single layer of large bubble wrap, increases the risk of breakage during transit, even with a diligent carrier like FedEx. These concerns, particularly when dealing with delicate goods like salsa, should not be overlooked.", "This salsa is truly a gem that I recently discovered - a real standout! However, I recommend steering clear of the variety pack as the other two options included are simply not worth the hype or your hard-earned cash.", "They remind me of dog treats I made with pumpkin and cinnamon. They're bland and not my favorite Back To Nature product, but my fiance really loves them, hence the three-star rating.", "This cornmeal is superb. I used it to make delicious regular cornbread and hot water cornbread, both of which turned out outstanding. I also fried some oysters with this cornmeal, enhancing their texture and flavor.", "This marinade is fantastic! I enjoy using it for chicken, whether baked in the oven or grilled. It's full of flavor and flair, and I've even served it at dinner parties to great reviews from my guests! Definitely a worthwhile purchase - affordable and simple to use. I love it!", "Transform your chicken, fish, beef, or pork into delectable masterpieces effortlessly. Elevate the taste to perfection. Enjoy huge savings of over 50% when you purchase in bulk compared to retail stores.", "Purchased this product for my brother, who is adhering to the Jorge Cruise diet, and decided to sample it myself. I must admit that the flavor was quite pleasing.", "Hazelnut coffee creamer is my favorite, but it's weird that Amazon is selling it for $9.99 for a box of 24 singles when you can get it for $2.50 - $3.36 at the store. It's definitely not a good deal.", "I'm thrilled with this yummy flavor! It's a great healthy alternative to our usual desserts. I'm glad I tried it because Jello desserts offer endless delicious possibilities while still being good for you. I'll definitely buy this product again - the flavor was absolutely wonderful.", "I searched 4 grocery stores to find this delicious Jello flavor for my green tomato jam recipe, and I was thrilled to finally find it here! This Jello is amazing! It seems to only be available during the summer, and with fall harvest approaching, I couldn't locate it anywhere else in town. The watermelon flavor of this Jello is fantastic, and the jam I made with it tastes just like watermelon jam! It's also great as regular Jello. So yummy!", "This salt is a great choice for optimal health. This box will easily last our family for a year. Unlike regular salt, iodized sea salt won't increase your blood pressure.", "Ideal sea salt for your table or picnic basket \u2013 it shakes well, doesn't clump, and flows freely. A must-have!", "The expiration date for this product is 21 months from the date of purchase. This delicious tuna and tomato combination is among the items I frequently reorder from Amazon. I have included a brief video to provide a visual of this pairing. While I initially filmed the video with a headlamp, the focus on the tuna was not satisfactory. Considering the minimal views on this product, I am unsure whether redoing the video would be necessary.", "I had never come across the SAFCOL brand previously, but I wanted a change from the usual pouches like Starkist and Chicken of the Sea. I found SAFCOL to be surprisingly better than the others with a more subtle seasoning.", "These tuna packs are the best-tasting in my opinion. They make a great on-the-go snack and are really satisfying with the tomato.", "I typically go for Star-Kist tuna, but decided to mix things up by giving this brand a shot. Unfortunately, the flavors were overpowering with too much basil and other spices, and it just didn't hit the spot for me.", "I haven't heard of Safcol before, but since I love tuna, I decided to try it. The tuna is good quality, but I thought the tomato basil flavor was a bit boring. It's better than plain tuna, but it didn't have the strong taste I was expecting. However, it's a good choice for a low-calorie, low-fat meal.", "I thought this was more delicious compared to regular tuna pouches available. It is of high quality and doesn't require any additional seasoning. I heated it in the microwave at 20% power for 1 minute and it was perfect! I think heating it a little enhances the flavor.", "This product was extremely bland. Despite there being tastier alternatives available, it is a better choice calorie-wise compared to a Special K bar or a cookie snack pack. You can enhance its flavor by seasoning it or pairing it with another food item.", "I discovered pomegranate molasses and had to try it. It's decadent with a dark, syrupy, sour, and slightly sweet taste. A dab makes me forget about dessert. It has a unique flavor with a pleasing metallic undertone. Planning to make fesenjan next. Yum!", "Try this out in Moroccan dishes, mix it into a delicious drink, or drizzle it on sliced oranges with a touch of orange water. It's absolutely amazing!", "I had to discard half of the beans since they had been sitting at the back of a shelf for an unknown duration and were too old to cook properly, exhibiting damaged skins indicating they were past their prime. Unfortunately, I can't return or get a refund for them due to the non-returnable policy on food items. I'll look for a new brand to purchase in the future. In the meantime, I have around fifty servings of beans that need to be disposed of.", "Smaller than banana runts, these candies may look similar and have the same texture. However, they do not taste like banana runts and are not enjoyable. I am planning to return them to the vendor.", "The overall quality of the item was good, but the Banana Heads are significantly smaller than Banana Runts. Upon receiving the package, I was disappointed to find the Banana Heads had spilled out due to poor packaging, littering the entire envelope.", "I bought them as baby shower favors with a Jungle theme, perfect for 25 small bags of candy. I purchased 5#; for more than 25 bags, buy a larger size.", "I've been enjoying Ricore ever since my mother let me start drinking caffeine. I particularly love it mixed with milk. It has a smoother and more delightful taste compared to instant coffee with milk. As a French person living in the US, I make sure to bring back boxes of Ricore whenever I can. Savora is another hidden gem worth bringing back. Be sure to give it a try!", "Key points emphasized: First tried drink from mother, brought from Brittany France, found delicious, wishes it were cheaper, loves the product overall.\n\nRewritten: The drink came from my mother's trip to Brittany, France, and it tasted delicious! Although it could be more affordable, I absolutely adore this product.", "I was excited to sample the 8-inch Cinnamon Coffee Cake because it is crafted using fresh ingredients like eggs, sour cream, and Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla, and is generously topped and filled with cinnamon streusel. This delectable cake can be purchased online for just $18.95. Having enjoyed various cinnamon coffee cakes in the past, I must say that the FantasiCakes Cinnamon Coffee Cake truly stands out in terms of its size, affordability, quality, and flavor.\n\nUpon arrival, the cake was promptly delivered and thoughtfully packaged to ensure almost pristine condition. It even includes a generous tub of white icing for drizzling before serving. I was pleasantly surprised by the generous size of the cake; it was enough to satisfy my family of 5 for breakfast over three days. The cake itself is dense and moist, akin to a sponge cake, offering a satisfying texture. The blend of sticky cinnamon on the outside and sweet cinnamon and vanilla swirled inside creates an irresistible flavor profile. The icing adds a perfect finishing touch, enhancing the overall moist and sweet taste. Enjoy a slice with your morning coffee for a delightful breakfast treat!", "I used to enjoy these when I was younger, savoring the combination of water and lemon juice from this brand. However, about 5-6 years ago, I stopped consuming it. The flavor used to be very bold, and just a small sip would give me an invigorating feeling. It seems that the product has undergone some changes over time, possibly adding more water to reduce its intensity. The stronger it was, the less you needed to use. While the product is still of good quality, its taste now resembles that of cheaper brands. I had expected these to disappear quickly, as I adore all things lemony, unless they go bad. This remains a good product, but I do miss the intense chug-worthy sensation it used to provide.", "One of the best lemon juices I've tried. I'm a repeat customer because of its high quality. It's a great supplement when fresh lemons are not available for cooking or drinks. I will keep buying it.", "This lemon juice is an essential kitchen staple that adds a burst of flavor to any dish with just a small amount. I incorporate a splash of it into my daily routine, enhancing the taste of my meals and beverages. Its bold taste and versatility make it a must-have ingredient year-round. I am committed to purchasing this product repeatedly.", "Prompt delivery and high-quality product. This lemon juice concentrate is identical to what you would find in stores and is incredibly convenient for enhancing sauces, dressings, and more. The hassle of juicing fresh lemons every time you need it, not to mention always having lemons on hand, is a thing of the past.", "This is not as delicious as the Chilled Lime juice, but it is tasty. It has a slightly peculiar taste, maybe due to a preservative. I really hope I could purchase the chilled juice!", "I was so surprised to hear how chill this drink is! Seriously, just have it if you're winding down for a nap or bedtime. Not a good idea if you're about to drive or do anything else important.<br /><br />My arms and legs almost feel like they're tingling with relaxation. Before long, my eyes start getting droopy and I'm off in dreamland.<br /><br />I'm totally into this stuff.", "I recently picked up a case of twelve from Grocery Outlet in the Seattle-Tacoma region for just $4.00 - a major bargain compared to the $38.00 original price! At just 3 for a dollar, it's quite a steal. The taste is decent - not the best, but definitely not the worst. Plus, it's low in calories. I might grab more, but not unless the price comes back down to reality!", "This product is excellent. It tastes great and works just as it says. It's a fantastic natural sleep helper. Awesome!", "We've been exploring natural remedies to aid our sleep in light of our high levels of stress and busy schedules. While attending a yoga class would likely be more beneficial, this alternative method is a good second choice. This solution is great for helping both to fall asleep and to stay asleep. I consumed half of it on the first night, which was sufficient. Within 30 minutes, I was ready to hit the hay! I woke up feeling rejuvenated and without any grogginess, which was a major advantage.\n\nI rated the product 3 stars instead of the 5 it truly deserves due to the subpar packaging. The shipment contained two broken bottles, resulting in a loss of $6 at this price point! The glass bottles were inadequately wrapped with just a single layer of small-bubbled bubble wrap before being placed in a larger box with excess room for movement. Although the packaging fell short, the product itself is excellent.", "We baked delicious chocolate chip cookies using BRM Garbanzo Bean Flour and the outcome was amazing! The combination of brown sugar and chocolate effectively masks any bean flavor mentioned in other reviews. Our friends couldn't even tell the difference from traditional chocolate chip cookies. The texture is wonderfully chewy, with a good body and elasticity that prevents the cookies from falling apart, unlike most other gluten-free flours. Additionally, the high protein and fiber content make these cookies filling, allowing you to feel satisfied with smaller portions and benefitting from a lower glycemic index. I highly recommend this flour, especially for making chocolate chip cookies.", "This is fantastic! I whipped up a batch of delicious banana bread using this great quality product at the best price in town.", "We had difficulty finding this item locally, but the delivery was quick, saving us from having to search the flour aisle at our local grocery stores.", "This glaze packet is the key ingredient for creating classic European-style fresh fruit tarts. I am preparing one for a pie auction at church, following a request for a \"strawberry\" themed dessert. By baking a base, layering it with raw fresh sliced fruit, and pouring the contents of one of these packets over it, you can craft stunning and somewhat \"healthier\" fruit tarts. The glaze sets at room temperature, securing the fruit in place for easy slicing while showcasing the beauty of the arranged fruit. Additionally, this glaze can be used over cheesecakes, providing a stable base for a fruit topping. While I'm not a fan of cheesecake due to its richness, a fruit-glazed cheesecake is undeniably beautiful. To achieve this, adorn the cheesecake with sliced fruit while it is still in the springform pan, then pour on the glaze, allowing it to set before removing the pan to reveal a translucent layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake. Cherries, strawberries, or sliced mangos work well, but my favorite variation includes delicate slices of lemons that have been gently poached in sugar syrup before being layered on the cake.\n\nFor the tart base, I prefer using a sponge cake baked in a shallow pan; however, other options such as pate sucre (a French pastry similar to a sugar cookie) are suitable for fluted straight-sided forms. Mini tarts can also be made using a muffin pan by pre-baking each mold with a layer of pie crust or pate sucre for better shape and texture. After blind-baking the pate-lined muffin tins, fill them with fresh fruits, pour over the glaze, and for added richness, add a layer of creme patisserie beneath the fruit. This pastry cream-like custard stabilized with flour enhances the flavor of these mini tarts.\n\nIf you're passionate about baking, this glaze is a kitchen essential. The vegan ingredients\u2014tapioca starch, carrageenan, dextrose, cream of tartar, and locust bean gum\u2014make it versatile for use in vegan tofu cheesecakes and fruit tarts with a nut crust base.", "My Scotties were riddled with hot spots, but after just one week of using this product, all the hot spots were completely eradicated! The scent is quite powerful, but not unpleasant - totally bearable!", "I chose this coffee due to its affordability compared to Ganocafe, and it contains organic reishi mushroom along with other beneficial antioxidants. Surprisingly, it not only tastes delightful but is also a great value for just $5. While my sisters are loyal to Ganocafe, I am excited to introduce them to this more economical yet comparable option. I plan to provide an update on my experience with this product in a few weeks. :)", "This coffee is meticulously crafted, but its flavor falls short of remarkable. While Nescafe and Mount Hagen reign supreme in my book, I ventured to diversify my options with this choice\u2014only to find myself hesitant to repurchase. A subtle hint of a \"vitaminy\" undertone is present, though not overpowering. Factor in its steep price, and the overall value may leave you wanting more.", "This coffee is fantastic with organic ingredients and no pesticides. It also tastes good and offers the healing effects of ganoderma.", "Discover the incredible taste of this coffee that stands out from the rest. I've enjoyed various instant coffees in the past, but this one truly stands out as one of the best. If you're looking to experience another one of my top picks (non-organic), give 'Africafe pure instant coffee' a try.", "I really enjoy this product! It tastes amazing and gives me a nice energy boost without any jitters. However, I do wish it came in a resealable jar or a sturdy plastic container instead of a zip-lock pouch. The zip-lock didn't last long and ended up ripping off. The product itself is fantastic, but I'm not a big fan of the packaging.", "These miniature mints are not only delicious but also provide a refreshing sensation. I typically consume salads for lunch, which can sometimes result in unpleasant breath. Consuming two of these mints post-lunch, due to their small size, effectively addresses this issue. Moreover, these mints are sugar-free, eliminating the risk of promoting the growth of odor-causing bacteria. Their enjoyable taste makes me consider them as an integral part of my lunch routine. Overall, purchasing these mints in bulk represents good value, and I highly endorse their use. Cheers!", "I prefer these over the regular Altoids, but they are definitely more expensive, so you better enjoy them.", "Check out these amazing sugar-free mint tins! Perfect for on-the-go, each tin contains fifty mints \u2013 just the right amount to conveniently carry with you. Not only are they better for your teeth compared to sugary alternatives, but at just twelve dollars, they're also a fantastic deal. Share them with friends and family and discover the refreshing taste for yourself. Don't miss out \u2013 try these mints today and you won't be disappointed!", "Pros:\n- Great packaging, shipping, and price\n- Purchased within a year of expiration (enough to eat/share 9 boxes)\n- Authentic mint flavor, not too fresh or powdery\n\nCons: None", "\"Make sure you don't consume a large quantity of these in one day because one of the chemicals it contains acts as a laxative. Haha!\"", "These mints pack a powerful punch of flavor that will leave your taste buds tingling! Not only are they bursting with taste, but they are also the perfect size to conveniently carry in your pocket or purse.", "This is an incredibly massive supply of them! I'm still hard at work on these and have loads to spare! So much better than constantly buying one from the grocery store or 7-11 whenever you need a mint!", "It seems like these little tins are less than half filled at the price charged \u2013 what a rip-off! Could there be some exotic ingredient as precious as gold packed in those tiny squares? Or could it be a sneaky cereal ploy, filled at the factory but settling in transport? Can manufacturers be trustworthy in their dealings?"]
