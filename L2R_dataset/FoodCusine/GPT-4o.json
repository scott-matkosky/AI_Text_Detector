In fact, it's superior to many organic and all-natural brands I've sampled. The assorted flavors in McCann's variety pack are all quite tasty, and you can quickly prepare it with either a microwave or boiling water, making it incredibly convenient when you're in a hurry.\n\nMoreover, McCann's use of real cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup was a major selling point for me. Real sugar not only tastes better but is also less harmful. However, I'm not a fan of their use of thickeners like guar gum. Ideally, oatmeal should be just oats, water, and heat to create a creamy, delicious texture. I suspect these additives are the reason McCann's instant oatmeal sometimes becomes overly thick and gluey after sitting for a bit. Despite this, it remains a practical choice for those with limited time.", "This is a high-quality instant oatmeal from a leading brand.

Perfect for a cold morning when you\u2019re short on time and can\u2019t prepare McCann\u2019s Steel Cut Oats. The apple cinnamon flavor is the best, but the maple and brown sugar and the original flavors are also delicious. Plus, you can easily distinguish between the three flavors without needing to tweak them.", "Instant oatmeal often turns soggy as soon as the water is added, but McCann's Instant Oatmeal maintains its texture, offers excellent flavor, and is nutritious.

Plus, cold milk or cream just doesn't cut it for my steaming hot cup of Joe.\n\nOne day, while browsing Amazon, I had an epiphany: why not create my own creamer? I also found low-fat (non-instant) milk powder and regular milk powder. The non-instant low-fat milk is sweeter and tastes fresher but doesn\u2019t dissolve well in cold water\u2014not an issue for hot coffee. You\u2019ll need to experiment with the ratios; I found that using just the heavy cream powder made my coffee too rich, and it's also pricey. My sweet spot is a blend of one-third each.\n\nFor flavor, I bought cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and superfine sugar. I mix up small batches with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to craft my personalized flavored creamers. If you prefer, a sugar substitute would work just as well. I store my concoctions in jelly canning jars and use a mini food processor to blend everything evenly, so the sugar doesn\u2019t settle at the bottom. Pro tip: let it settle before opening the top.\n\nThis DIY creamer tastes leaps and bounds better than anything from the store, and the fun part is experimenting to create your own unique flavors. Next on my list? Mixing in essential oils for a divine chocolate-orange flavor.\n\nAll the ingredients can be found online. Take the time to experiment\u2014you might skip the low-fat milk or decide against adding flavors.

I usually avoid the fish flavors since they smell...\n\nAdditionally, I began buying from Amazon because Petco didn\u2019t carry the wet food in boxes and only had a few cans. When I got home, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I could save $20 each time I bought dog food if I ordered from Amazon.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Natural Balance dog food. Although I've never tasted it myself, my dog seems to love it.", "This is the same pet food we usually buy at the store. But now it gets delivered right to our doorstep! And it's either the same price or even cheaper.", "I've been very pleased with Natural Balance dog food. Our dogs had issues with other brands, possibly due to grain allergies. Since switching to Natural Balance grain-free, there have been no problems. Additionally, they offer different kibble sizes for larger and smaller dogs, which is very helpful.", "My 18-month-old Basenji/Jack Russell mix absolutely loves this dog food. Since switching from standard brands earlier this year, he has become visibly healthier and more energetic. Although natural dog foods are more expensive, I've noticed that he eats significantly less of the Natural Balance brand while still remaining satisfied and happy. Previously, he would consume up to 3 cups of regular dog food daily (the recommended amount for his size), but now he only needs about 1 to 1.5 cups of Natural Balance each day. This means you get more value for your money with natural dog foods, as they last just as long and contribute to a healthier, happier dog. Plus, with free 2-day shipping via Amazon Prime, I'm completely convinced!", "Our pup has suffered from allergies, including hotspots and itching, caused by other dog foods. The inexpensive, widely available options often contain harmful preservatives that can lead to health issues for your pets. This particular food has significantly reduced our dog's allergies, and he loves it. \n\nThis message is RAMSEY FrAnkenSteiN approved.", "My 3-year-old English Bulldog had skin allergies. The vet advised us to switch from his previous Iams Lamb and Rice to a limited diet food. This second option worked well, catering to dogs sensitive to additives and common proteins like chicken or beef.", "I tried giving this to my Golden Retriever, but he really didn't like it. He refused to eat it, and when he finally did, it upset his stomach and caused severe diarrhea. We definitely won't be purchasing this product again, especially given its high price.", "The mouth utters, \"How do I love thee? Let me count the ways...\"<br />For enthusiasts of Apple products, this item is indispensable. The only drawback is the shipping cost, as these items are quite heavy.", "The package arrived slightly thawed, and my parents wouldn't accept it. However, the company was very helpful and issued a full refund.", "The crust on these tarts is flawless. My husband loves them, but I'm not a big fan. They are just too sour for my liking. I eat the crust and my husband takes the filling. My kids think they\u2019re fantastic, so maybe it's just a personal preference.", "These tartlets are scrumptious! My husband and I love them, but the shipping is pricier than the treats themselves.", "What a great alternative to apple pie! I love that there's no need for slicing and dicing. It's so easy to prepare, and the best part is, you can make them fresh whenever you need them.", "I have a distinct appreciation for Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e. I was particularly delighted by the simplicity of preparing these desserts. One merely needs to sprinkle the provided sugar and broil. The result is visually stunning and delectable in taste. My guests assumed I had exerted considerable effort, yet the entire process took merely five minutes. I shall certainly be procuring more.", "This wasn't what I expected based on the company's great reputation for home delivery products.", "My first encounter with pickled asparagus was at an Amish market, and it was an instant hit. So, when I spotted them on the discount shelf at my local Safeway, I didn't hesitate to clear the rack. To my delight, these are even better than the Amish market ones! They're simply fantastic, and some jars even come with a bonus clove of garlic at the bottom. I'm definitely ordering the six-pack, even though I'm the only one in my household. Trust me, none of these will go to waste!", "I love asparagus, but until recently, I had never tried pickled asparagus. When a friend introduced me to this specific brand, I was amazed by how delicious it was. I loved it so much that I bought a six-pack. Now, I only have two jars left and definitely need to get more!", "I'm on a diet and went to Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Grocery for tasty, non-fat, low-calorie foods. I bought about a dozen items, including Tillen Farms Pickled Crispy Asparagus. I love asparagus and have tried several brands, but this one is the best. The flavor is excellent, and there's a big clove of garlic at the bottom of the jar that I'm excited to eat. This asparagus tastes amazing, and it's only 60 calories per jar. This is my idea of good diet food!\n\nGary Peterson", "I was disappointed in the flavor and texture of this mix, even though I usually like most Low Carb products.", "I have been consuming this tea for an extended period. Previously, I was required to procure it from a doctor's office, as it was not available through other channels. I am pleased to now have the convenience of purchasing it from Amazon.com. I consume this tea consistently throughout the day, much like others consume coffee. It boasts a wonderful taste.", "I have been indulging in Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea (100 tea bags x 2g each) as my daily beverage for several years. To mitigate shipping costs, I procure 12 boxes at a time. For numerous years, my routine was dominated by a relentless consumption of coffee from dawn until dusk. Eventually, I recognized that such a habit was detrimental to my health. Determined to enhance my well-being, I ceased drinking coffee altogether. In my quest for a suitable substitute, I experimented with various beverages and discovered that green tea not only delights the palate but also confers numerous health benefits. Unlike coffee and other beverages, green tea genuinely contributes to improved health, rivaled only by quality cold water. In my assessment, given its price point, Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea is among the most palatable options available. This tea boasts a stunning golden hue and a taste that is both vibrant and fresh. I highly recommend enhancing its sweetness and nutritional value by adding a small amount of Y.S. Organic Bee Farms RAW HONEY. Occasionally, I indulge in the more extravagant Tribute Xi Hu Long Jing tea; however, despite its exceptional quality, it is not feasible for daily consumption due to its cost.\n\nCons: My latest shipment deviated from the packaging shown on the Amazon page. The packaging I received prominently displays \"NATURALLY HIGH IN POLYPHENOL CATECHINS\" (a significant component contributing to tea\u2019s possible health benefits), whereas the Amazon listing indicates \"CAFFEINE FREE.\" Consequently, I am uncertain whether this green tea is genuinely caffeine-free. Additionally, a minor inconvenience I encounter is that occasionally the tea bag tears when I unwind the string. To prevent this, if the string appears adhered to the bag, I immerse it in hot water to detach it safely.", "This is undoubtedly one of the finest teas I've ever had. It's crisp, vibrant, and refreshing. Excellent delivery and consistent quality. Give it a try!", "I absolutely love this green tea. It is very difficult to find in our area, and some online stores charge a high price while providing fewer boxes than this seller. I will definitely order from this merchant again. Thank you! I rely on my daily green tea fix!", "I'm a big fan of this tea. It really helps me control my appetite throughout the day. My Mom and I have shared it with all our friends to let them experience it too.", "As an Italian who lived in Italy for many years, I used to enjoy these cookies with my daily breakfast espresso. After moving to the Bay Area, I couldn't find them anywhere. It's wonderful to have them again.", "In the 1980s, I had the pleasure of spending multiple summers in Italy. Among the delightful culinary traditions there, biscotti often graced the breakfast table or served as a perfect mid-day treat. These simple yet delicious cookies were a rarity in the US at that time. They were so irresistible that on my recent trip to Italy, I couldn't resist bringing back two bags. It's wonderful that they're now available on Amazon! \n\nNote: There's something truly special about opening a fresh bag, breathing in the aroma, pouring a glass of milk, and dipping the Macines in. It's a fantastic routine and a delightful treat for children!", "I first heard about this product from our local pet store and decided to give it a try with a small bag for our two cats, aged 3 and 6. Our younger female cat loved it immediately, and surprisingly, our older male cat \u2013 who typically resists any diet changes due to being raised on low-quality cat food \u2013 enjoyed it as well.\n\nThe older male cat is overweight and we were trying to transition him to soft food on the vet's advice, but he refused. He has refined tastes and is quite particular. Despite his high calorie intake, at least I know he's eating nutritious food now. Although this product is more expensive than many other brands, I prefer it over the poor alternatives marketed as healthy. It puzzles me why some commercials promote vegetarian cat food that's mostly cornmeal. It doesn't seem right to me. For now, I\u2019ll stick with this product and keep you updated.\n\nAfter nine months of using this cat food, I've decided to upgrade my rating from 4 to 5 stars. Both cats are thriving on it. Garfield, the older male, still eats a bit too much, but he\u2019s a large, sedentary cat. The female cat, who will be 4 soon, is healthy, happy, and agile despite her small size. We tried the chicken version of Holistic Select, but Garfield missed this sardine flavor, so we switched back. I\u2019ve also ordered the duck version and will provide an update once they try it.", "I began purchasing this after noticing that my 1-year-old cat was already losing his energy. I decided it was time to switch to high-quality cat food instead of the junk available at supermarkets. Among the countless options at the pet store, I chose this brand to try first, and it turned out to be an excellent decision. My cat has been eating it for the past 8 months, and he is now as active as he was as a kitten, with an incredibly soft coat. Most importantly, he loves the taste! I highly recommend this brand to all my friends and family for their pets.", "I've spent a lot of time researching the best food for my cat, and Holistic Select has truly impressed me. My holistic veterinarian also highly recommends it. What stands out to me is that they add probiotics to the kibble as the final step, which I find crucial. The best part is my cat took to it right away\u2014she loved it so much that I had to stop mixing it with her old food because she refuses to eat anything else!", "My vet recommended this cat food because my 13-year-old Cleo was struggling to keep any food down and was losing weight. It resolved her issues completely. She now eats less but seems more satisfied, which helps justify the higher cost. Additionally, it aids in digestion, eliminating any unpleasant odors. I wanted to mention this so that anyone experiencing similar problems with their cats can see the numerous benefits of this cat food.", "I have a 4-year-old male cat with chronic UTIs. Feeding him this dry food, along with wet food mixed with water and Uri Ease, keeps his infections in check. Switching to other dry foods worsens his condition. Despite the cost, this diet works best for him, and my other cats enjoy it too.", "Before I learned about feline nutrition, my cats were totally hooked on dry cat food. I used to offer both canned and dry options, but now I wish I had stuck to premium canned food and cut back on the dry stuff. \n\nI have two spry 15-year-old cats and two energetic 5-year-olds. The only top-notch dry foods they liked were Wellness and Innova... until Innova's manufacturer got snapped up by Procter & Gamble. Then I was on a mission to find a worthy replacement. \n\nAfter testing out a bunch of new samples from my go-to holistic pet store, the only contender that passed the sniff test (apart from Wellness and Innova) was Holistic Select. So, if you have picky cats like mine, give Holistic Select a try. It's top-quality and perfect for those feline food critics.", "My holistic veterinarian suggested this and several other brands. After trying them all, my cats favor this one, particularly the sardine flavor. The standout benefit is that their coats are incredibly soft and clean, and their eyes are noticeably clear. Additionally (and I mean this as politely as possible), their waste has a much milder smell compared to cats fed the low-quality food from most stores, which is a huge advantage for me! The health benefits are clear, and I highly recommend Holistic Select!", "One of my cats is allergic to fish and beef, and this formula is one of the few she can eat. It has better ingredients than vet-prescribed diets. Both my cats are active, have shiny fur, and are in good shape. The dry food also helps reduce tartar buildup on their teeth.", "Our cats exhibit exceptional health and vitality on this dry cat food. We have observed a significant reduction in hairball incidents, and their fur is now extraordinarily healthy and glossy. They maintain a fit physique without any issues of being overweight. Furthermore, this vendor ensures remarkably swift shipping and ranks among the top suppliers on Amazon in our estimation!", "I have long been an enthusiast of Hot & Spicy Maruchan Ramen. If you appreciate spiciness and have an affinity for ramen, this product is highly recommended. Unfortunately, the price on Amazon is considerably higher. At my local Walmart, the cost is merely $3.36 for a pack of twelve.", "Ever since I was a child, I've enjoyed Ramen noodles, but no flavor has ever surpassed Hot & Spicy Chicken! While it might not be particularly hot for a chili aficionado like me, its taste is unmatched!", "I LOVE spicy ramen, but man, it really messes with my stomach and the burning feeling sticks around for like 3 hours! Not sure if that's normal or what... By the way, you can snag this at Walmart for just $0.28, way cheaper than Amazon.", "Having always been an enthusiast of ramen as a convenient and simple meal, discovering it on Amazon at a reasonable price and having it delivered to one's doorstep by the case presents an extraordinary opportunity.", "This soup tastes unbearably spicy, almost like fire. Normally, I enjoy spicy food if it has good flavor, but this soup lacks it. The intense heat overpowers any taste.", "I really enjoyed the spicy flavor of these. Surprisingly, I preferred the broth over the noodles, which is unusual for me. If you're not accustomed to spicy foods, this might be too intense, but if you love very hot foods, it might not be spicy enough.", "I snagged these on sale for about 25 cents a cup, which is half of what my local grocery stores charge, and they almost never have the spicy flavors. These are perfect for a quick snack at the office when I'm too busy to grab a real meal. This flavor of Instant Lunch is one of my favorites, and I'll definitely stock up whenever it's on sale.", "I've purchased many varieties, and this one stands out as a favorite. I'll be getting more shortly.", "I love this ramen flavor! Other flavors taste bland by comparison. With prime, I get it delivered in two days without paying for shipping, but it's still cheaper to buy a case at the grocery store.", "The best investment I've made for ginger! It's fibrous and spicy like real ginger, but the sugar balances it perfectly. Totally worth $40 for 5lbs. I'll be getting more soon to top my ginger cupcakes and cookies!", "This ginger is absolutely delicious. Unfortunately, I cannot find Australian ginger in my local area. However, this ginger compares very favorably to the Australian ginger I've bought in other cities. Now, I can savor its amazing taste without the need to travel.", "I keep experimenting with other, cheaper brands\u2014what a mistake! This ginger is absolutely worth every penny. It's tender, moist, and consistently perfect.", "My son has had acid reflux since birth and tried all available medications with no improvement. An older gentleman recommended this product, so I ordered it for him, not expecting much. To our surprise, by day 2 of eating one piece of this ginger each morning, his symptoms disappeared. He can now eat anything and enjoy it. This product was a godsend for him. Thank you!", "I acquired this for our office to provide a delectable treat for colleagues to enjoy. Its bite-sized nature makes it more convenient for individuals to take a few pieces rather than an entire licorice stick. My sole criticism is that one of the bags ruptured during transit.", "Twizzlers brand licorice is far superior to other well-known brands. If you can find them for $2 to $2.50 per package with free shipping, it's a great deal. The black and cherry flavors are delicious, but the strawberry flavor is too subtle and barely noticeable.", "I absolutely love these \u2013 they\u2019re so tasty! In fact, I think I\u2019m hooked on them. Buying them in packs of six is much more cost-effective than getting individual bags at Target, saving about $1.00 per bag. I use the subscribe and save option for these and a few other products, and I love it!", "If you're seeking a cleaner option of licorice for children, be sure to try these! They are soft, easy to chew, and won\u2019t leave your hands sticky\u2014whether in the car, during summer outings, or at the beach. We love all the flavors and often mix them with chocolate for a delightful snack. Excellent product at a great price\u2014highly recommended!", "I could be wrong, but it seems like the pieces in this bag have shrunk. If that's the case, it was probably done to make it look like you're getting more for your money with all those pieces. The issue is, the pieces need to be a certain size to pack enough flavor for a satisfying experience. Now, you need 2 or 3 pieces to equal the old size, and it's just not the same.", "As a long-time admirer of Newman's Pineapple salsa, I was on the hunt for a similar option. This one ranks among the tastiest salsas I've ever tried. My daughters are also fans. They aren't fond of overly chunky salsa, and the Berry Mango offers a pleasant smoothness with small bits of mango. The salsa strikes the perfect balance of sweetness and carries a mild yet delightful kick. At this price, it's a great deal!", "The salsa had a delightful aroma, suggesting it was indeed appetizing. However, it appears that the packer(s) at Amazon had insufficient packing materials, particularly for the bottoms of the bottles. As a result, the bottoms of all three bottles were broken. Upon attempting to process a return via my computer, I was informed that returns are not accepted for food items. Subsequently, I sought out a customer service option, but found none available on their newly redesigned website. While Amazon may take pride in their website's new appearance, it is crucial for them to provide a contact method for emergencies. Given my history of frequent purchases, which always arrive in secure styrofoam boxes, it is perplexing that glass salsa bottles were shipped in a cardboard box with only a strip of large bubble wrap for protection. Regardless of the care taken by the carrier, such as FedEx, breakage is inevitable with such inadequate packaging, particularly for glass containers.\n\nBarbara L. S.", "This is undoubtedly one of the finest salsas I have discovered in a long while; however, I would advise avoiding the variety pack. The other two salsas included in the pack are not worth the expense.", "These remind me of dog treats I once made with pumpkin and cinnamon.

I used it to make traditional cornbread and hot water cornbread, and both turned out fantastic. I also fried some oysters with it, and the texture and flavor were incredible.", "This marinade is fantastic! I use it for both baked and grilled chicken. It's so flavorful that I've served it at dinner parties and received great reviews. It's definitely worth the price\u2014affordable and easy to use. I love it!", "Suitable for chicken, fish, beef, or pork. Efficient, straightforward, and delivers exceptional flavor. Additionally, purchasing in bulk offers savings of over 50% compared to retail stores.", "I purchased this for my brother, who adheres to the Jorge Cruise diet, and decided to sample one myself. To my surprise, it is quite palatable.", "These singles typically cost just $2.50 to $3.36 for a box of 24 at the store, so it's perplexing why Amazon is charging $9.99 for the same product. Hazelnut coffee creamer is my favorite, but at that price, it's definitely not worth the purchase.", "Amazing flavor! I bought it as a healthier dessert option, and I'm so glad I did. There are countless ways to enjoy Jello desserts while keeping them tasty and nutritious. I will definitely be purchasing this product again because the flavor was fantastic.", "I visited 4 stores to find watermelon Jello for my green tomato jam recipe and finally found it here.

They make an excellent on-the-go snack and are incredibly satisfying, especially with the tomato.", "I have consistently purchased Star-Kist tuna; however, I decided to try this brand to explore a different option. Unfortunately, I found the flavor of the tuna to be unpalatable, as it contained an excessive amount of basil and other spices.", "As a tuna enthusiast, I decided to try the Safcol brand despite not knowing it well. The tuna itself is high quality, but the tomato basil flavor felt a bit bland. While it\u2019s an upgrade from plain tuna, it didn\u2019t have the kick I expected. Nonetheless, it's an excellent low-calorie, low-fat meal option.", "I thought it was far more delicious than the regular tuna pouches available. Top-notch quality, with no need to add anything.<br /><br />I heated it in the microwave at 20% power for 1 minute, and voila!<br /><br />I think a bit of warming enhances the flavor.", "This product was quite tasteless, to be honest.

You might need to season it or mix it with something else to enhance the flavor.", "I recently discovered pomegranate molasses and couldn't resist giving it a taste! I haven't cooked with it yet, just sampled a bit here and there, but let me tell you, it's amazing! It's rich, thick, tangy, and a bit sweet. Just a small taste and I don't even miss dessert.

The brown sugar and chocolate completely masked the bean flavor mentioned in other reviews. Our friends couldn\u2019t tell any difference from traditional chocolate chip cookies. The texture, body, and elasticity (i.e., reduced tendency to crumble like most other gluten-free flours) were nice and chewy, just like cookies made with regular flour. An added bonus is the high protein and fiber content (estimated 2-3 grams of fiber per cookie), which makes you feel full with smaller servings and has a significantly lower glycemic index.\n\nI highly recommend this flour, even if chocolate chip cookies are the only thing you make with it.", "This product is fantastic!

The smell is strong but tolerable.", "I purchased this coffee since it's significantly more affordable than Ganocafe, plus it contains organic reishi mushroom and other beneficial antioxidants. I was surprised by how good it tastes! I've only been drinking it for a few days and at just $5, it's definitely worth it. My sisters all use Ganocafe, but I'm now introducing them to this budget-friendly alternative. I'll provide an update on this product in a few weeks. :)", "The coffee is finely processed, but the flavor is simply average. In comparison, Nescafe and Mount Hagen offer superior options. I purchased this product to explore alternatives, but I am unlikely to repurchase it. Although there is a subtle \"vitaminy\" taste, it is not overpowering. Additionally, the product is somewhat expensive relative to its quality.", "This coffee is fantastic because it's made with all organic ingredients! No need to worry about pesticides, it tastes delicious, and you get the healing benefits of ganoderma.", "Just like others have raved, this coffee boasts an exceptional taste. I've experimented with various instant coffees, but this one truly stands out. If you're eager to explore another fantastic option (though not organic), give 'Africafe Pure Instant Coffee' a try\u2014it's one of my top picks!", "This product tastes amazing and boosts my energy without causing jitters\u2014I absolutely love it! However, I wish it came in a resealable jar or durable plastic container instead of a zip-lock pouch. The zip-lock eventually ripped and stopped working. Despite the packaging issue, the product itself is fantastic.", "These tiny treats are absolutely delicious and incredibly refreshing!\n\nI often opt for salads at lunch, but we all know they can wreak havoc on your breath. That's where these come in. I pop two of them after my meal (they\u2019re petite, so why not?) and they do wonders for my breath.\n\nWhat\u2019s even better is that they\u2019re sugar-free! Sugar can actually encourage those pesky bacteria that cause bad breath, so these are a perfect alternative. They're so tasty, I almost consider them part of my meal.\n\nFor a great bulk value, these mints are a stellar choice. Highly recommended! Cheers!", "I have a stronger preference for these compared to the traditional Altoids; however, they come at an even higher price, so it's important that you truly enjoy them.", "These little tins of sugar-free mints were a fantastic find. They're perfect for on-the-go moments. With fifty mints per tin, they're just the right amount to carry along. Plus, they're better for your teeth compared to sugary mints. The price of twelve dollars was quite reasonable. They're also great for sharing. If you're in search of some mints, give these a try\u2014you'll be glad you did.", "Pros:\n+ Great packaging, quick shipping, and a good price.\n+ Still has about a year before it expires, so plenty of time to enjoy and share all 9 boxes.\n+ Perfect texture\u2014not too fresh like regular wintergreen and not powdery. It\u2019s the real deal!\n\nCons: None!", "Be careful not to eat too many in one day, as they contain a laxative chemical.", "These mints pack a powerful punch with their bold flavor, and their pocket-sized convenience makes them the perfect on-the-go refreshment!", "This is an immense stockpile of them. I'm still using these and have many left. Far more efficient than purchasing one from the grocery store or convenience store every time you desire a mint.", "Even with small containers, they hardly ever fill them up. These little tins are less than half full, making the high price feel like a rip-off. Do they contain some rare ingredient as valuable as gold in those tiny squares? Or is it the classic cereal trick, where the contents \"settle\" during transport? Can manufacturers just be honest for a change?"]
