# AI-Generated Text Detector

A transformer-based classifier distinguishing between human-authored and AI-generated texts, fine-tuned on extensive academic and diverse-domain datasets. Built on DistilBERT, enhanced by linguistic features, perplexity measures, and sentiment analysis for robust interpretability.  Transformers fine tuned on a macbook air M2 with 8GB memory.  Text entries were limited to 256 tokens to work within computing resources.  Fine-tuning took around 24 hours.

## Overview

This project leverages DistilBERT fine-tuned on ~23K labeled examples sourced from Kaggle's academic essays dataset, alongside the L2R dataset, which spans domains like academic research, business, and legal documents. The model utilizes sophisticated linguistic indicators and ensemble-based cross-validation for reliable identification of AI-generated content.

## Features

- **Transformer-based Detection**: DistilBERT fine-tuned specifically for AI-text discrimination.
- **Advanced Linguistic Indicators**:
    - **Readability**: Flesch-Kincaid, average sentence length.
    - **Structural Features**: Lexical diversity, burstiness (sentence length variance), function-word and stop-word ratios.
    - **Semantic Indicators**: TF-IDF cosine similarity, approximate edit distance.
    - **Perplexity Scoring**: GPT-2-based perplexity (higher indicates human-like complexity).
    - **Sentiment Analysis**: VADER sentiment (positive, neutral, negative thresholds).
- **Multi-format File Analysis**: Text, PDF, LaTeX, DOCX support.
- **CLI & PDF Reporting**: Command-line interface and comprehensive PDF reports detailing overall and sentence-level analyses.

## Evaluation Metrics

Model performance is rigorously assessed via:

- **Accuracy**: Overall classification correctness.
- **Precision**: Reliability of positive predictions (AI-generated text).
- **Recall**: Proportion of actual AI texts accurately classified.
- **F1-score**: Balance between precision and recall.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualization of True Positives, False Positives, True Negatives, and False Negatives.

### Performance Results

**Aggregated Cross-Validation Performance (5-folds):**

| Metric                 | Human-Written (%) | AI-Generated (%) |
|------------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Precision**          | 94.60             | 93.44            |
| **Recall**             | 83.91             | 97.97            |
| **F1-score**           | 88.91             | 95.65            |
| **Overall Accuracy**   | 93.82             |                  |

*(Metrics averaged over 5-fold cross-validation.)*

### Confusion Matrix

Aggregated confusion matrix across 5-fold cross-validation:

| Actual \ Predicted | Human-Written | AI-Generated |
|--------------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Human-Written**  | 5,816 (83.91%)| 1,098 (16.09%)|
| **AI-Generated**   | 330 (2.03%)   | 15,955 (97.97%)|

The confusion matrix indicates excellent recall in detecting AI-generated texts with ongoing efforts to minimize false positives (human texts identified as AI-generated).
